### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is a method of the `Driver` class in the `blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py` file.
2. The test function `test_comment_indentation` from `tests/test_black.py` checks the behavior of the code formatter on a specific input related to comments and indentation.
3. The GitHub issue highlights a problem with the behavior of the formatter in handling tabulated comments after a dedent operation.
4. The bug stems from incorrect handling of tabulated comments after a dedent operation, causing the comments to be incorrectly indented.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `_partially_consume_prefix` function does not correctly handle the situation where a comment appears after a dedent operation while using tabs for indentation. This results in incorrect indentation when processing the input.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation scenario described in the failing test related to tabulated comments after a dedent operation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ''
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ''
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if not current_line.strip() or current_column < column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ''
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to consider the scenario of a comment following a dedent operation with tabulation, the corrected version should now correctly handle the indentation behavior, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
