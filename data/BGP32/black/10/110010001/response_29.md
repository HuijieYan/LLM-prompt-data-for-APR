### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is failing to correctly handle the indentation levels of the input `prefix`.
- The test is failing due to incorrect handling of indentation in the `contents_tab` input.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect tracking of `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables.
2. Improper handling of tab and space characters.
3. Inaccurate logic for determining when to wait for a newline character.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function `_partially_consume_prefix` does not correctly handle the indentation rules. It fails to maintain correct indentation when encountering spaces, tabs, or newline characters, leading to incorrect results in the test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Ensure proper tracking of indentation levels using `current_column`.
- Update the logic for handling spaces, tabs, and newline characters.
- Verify that the function correctly detects when to wait for a newline character based on the indentation level.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_column += 1

        current_line += char

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            pass
        elif char == '\t':
            pass
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version addresses the issues related to tracking indentation levels and handling whitespace characters correctly. It should now pass the failing test provided.
