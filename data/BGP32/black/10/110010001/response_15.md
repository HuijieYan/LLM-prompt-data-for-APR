### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for consuming part of a prefix up to a certain column while handling indentation. The function iterates over each character of the prefix and constructs lines according to column and indentation rules.
2. The potential error location could be the logic around handling tab and space characters, which may not correctly calculate the column positions.
3. The bug causes the function to fail to handle the comment indentation correctly in the test case provided. It results in incorrect handling of the column position when encountering comment lines after multiple indentation levels.
4. The strategy for fixing the bug involves reviewing the logic related to calculating column positions, especially when encountering spaces and tabs. Ensure that the logic handles both spaces and tabs consistently to calculate the correct column position.
5. A corrected version of the function is provided below:

### Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Adjust for consistent handling of tab character
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function that handles the tab characters correctly, it should now pass the failing test related to comment indentation.
