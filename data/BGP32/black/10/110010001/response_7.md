### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` within the `Driver` class is responsible for processing a given `prefix` string and count the columns up to a specified limit.
- The error message suggests that the indentation of the comment in the input string is not being handled correctly, leading to an incorrect output.
- The function is failing to properly handle the indentation level when encountering comments, resulting in an incorrect output string that fails the test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- As the error is specifically related to handling comments and maintaining the correct indentation level, a fix needs to be applied to correctly assess and manage the column position of the comment lines.
- The logic within the function should be updated to correctly handle comments, and their associated indentation levels to produce the expected output that passes the test.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # Reset current_column to 0 for a new line
                current_column = 0
                # Ignore empty lines
                if current_line.strip():
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, the logic for handling newline characters when encountering comments has been updated. The function now correctly resets the `current_column` to 0 for a new line and ignores empty lines while maintaining the correct indentation level. This correction addresses the bug related to comment indentation handling and should now produce the expected output.
