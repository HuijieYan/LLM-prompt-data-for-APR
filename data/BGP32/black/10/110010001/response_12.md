### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column)` is responsible for partially consuming a given prefix until a certain column width is reached.
- The error message points out an issue with the indentation of comments in the code.
- The issue relates to the incorrect handling of spaces in the prefix, where the function fails to maintain consistent indentation for comments.

### Error Locations:
1. The function doesn't properly handle checking and maintaining the indentation level once a comment is encountered in the prefix.
2. There is an inconsistency in dealing with spaces and tabs when calculating the column position.
3. The function loses track of where the column position should be after encountering a comment.

### Bug Cause:
The main cause of the bug is that the function doesn't handle the indentation of comments in the prefix correctly. When a comment is detected, the function doesn't check if the comment's indentation matches the expected column position.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the function handles comments in the prefix. It should ensure that comment indentation is correctly aligned with the specified column position.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0  # Reset column position at newline
                lines.append(current_line)  # Add the current line to lines
                current_line = ""  # Reset current line
                continue
            else:
                # Finish indent check and determine wait_for_nl based on comments
                if char == '#':
                    wait_for_nl = True
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = False
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version addresses the bug by properly handling comments and maintaining the correct column position when a comment is found. The function now maintains consistent indentation for comments in the prefix.
