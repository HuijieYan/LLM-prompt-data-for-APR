### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` in the `Driver` class is responsible for partially consuming a string up to a specified column value. 
- The error message is related to incorrect indentation when consuming a prefix string with a tab character.
- The issue seems to be with the logic that calculates the correct column position when encountering tab characters.

### Identified Errors:
1. The calculation of the `current_column` value when encountering tab characters is incorrect. It should increase by 1 for each tab character.
   
### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs due to the incorrect increment of `current_column` in the following line:
  ```python
  current_column += 4
  ```
- When tabs are encountered, the column should be increased by 1 for each tab character.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the logic to increment `current_column` by 1 for each tab character encountered.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After making this change, re-run the test case to ensure that the corrected function now correctly consumes the prefix string and handles tabs during indentation.
