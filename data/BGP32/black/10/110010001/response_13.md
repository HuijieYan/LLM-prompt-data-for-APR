### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` in the `Driver` class is supposed to handle formatting by processing a given prefix string. It is designed to consume the prefix string up to a specific column until a newline character, and then return the consumed part as well as the remaining part.

### Identifying the Bug:
The bug seems to be related to the handling of indentations (spaces and tabs) and newlines in the prefix string. The function doesn't correctly handle comments after an indented block.

### Cause of the Bug:
The issue arises from the part of the code that deals with waiting for a newline character after encountering non-space characters or tabs. When the function encounters a comment at the end of an indented block, it fails to properly handle the newline character that follows the comment. This leads to an incorrect output as shown in the error message.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when the function encounters a comment at the end of an indented block, it correctly consumes the newline character following the comment before moving to the next line. This fix aims to maintain the correct formatting behavior and avoid the error in the test case provided.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the handling of the newline character after a comment in the corrected version of the function, it should now pass the failing test case.
