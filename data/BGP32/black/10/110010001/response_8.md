### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` in the `Driver` class is intended to consume a prefix string, line by line, based on the given column. It appends characters to the `current_line` until it detects a newline character or a specific condition. However, the logic of handling waiting for a newline and incrementing the `current_column` based on tab or space characters is causing some lines to not align as expected.

### Errors Locations:
- The logic when checking for space and tabs to increment `current_column` is causing inconsistent results.
- The logic for handling wait for a newline before checking the current column is not implemented correctly, leading to misaligned lines.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function causes issues with the alignment of lines, especially when handling indentation and waiting for a newline character. This results in the unexpected indentation differences between the actual and expected strings, as seen in the error message.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, it is essential to ensure that the column indentation logic is correctly implemented. Instead of waiting for a newline character to determine the current column, we should track the column changes for each character. Additionally, we need to handle the scenarios involving tabs and spaces more accurately.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        for char in prefix:
            if char != '\n':
                current_line += char
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
            else:
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
        
                lines.append(current_line + '\n')
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By fixing the way column indentation is handled and ensuring accurate line formation, the corrected version of the function should now align lines correctly based on the given column indentation.
