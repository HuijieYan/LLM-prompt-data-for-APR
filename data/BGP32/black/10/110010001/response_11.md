### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is part of the `Driver` class.
2. The function is used to handle indentation in a Python code snippet.
3. The error message shows that the comment indentation is not being handled correctly, resulting in a failed test.
4. The bug might be in how the function processes spaces, tabs, and newlines.
5. The bug causes the comment indentation to be wrongly aligned in some cases.


### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. The function must correctly handle the indentation level based on spaces or tabs while considering newlines and comments.
2. Make sure that the logic to handle indentation level and comments is accurate.
3. Adjust the handling of the comment indentation to align correctly.


### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
            
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # Handle empty lines
                lines.append(current_line)  # Add current line to lines
                current_line = ""  # Reset current line
                current_column = 0  # Reset current column
            else:
                # Handle indentation finish and comments
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should handle the comment indentation correctly, passing the failing test.
