### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to be used for identifying and consuming certain parts of a prefix string.
- The provided failing test `test_comment_indentation` is comparing two contents in different formats (`contents_tab` and `contents_spc`) after applying a formatting transformation.
- The error message indicates a mismatch in the output of the function for these contents.

### Identified Errors:
1. The current_line information is not properly reset after reaching a newline character, leading to missed content.
2. The logic for handling indentation using spaces and tabs might need adjustment.

### Bug Cause:
The bug might be caused by issues related to handling newline characters and resetting the current_line information properly. This could result in missing content or incorrect calculation of the remaining prefix.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Reset `current_line` after encountering a newline character, ensuring that it does not append content across lines.
2. Update the logic for tracking indentation levels using spaces and tabs to ensure correct column calculations.
3. Adjust the logic for waiting for a newline character to correctly track the end of an indent.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line += char
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                elif char == '\n':
                    if current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

Replacing the buggy `_partially_consume_prefix` function with the corrected version should address the issues and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
