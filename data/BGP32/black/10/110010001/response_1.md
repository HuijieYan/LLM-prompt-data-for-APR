1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is part of the `Driver` class in the `blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py` file.

2. The potential error locations within the function can be the handling of indentation levels using spaces and tabs, and the logic for waiting for a newline character.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the comment indentation when encountering comments in the input prefix. This results in the incorrect output and leads to failing test cases.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling whitespace characters (spaces and tabs) and properly handle comments while tracking the current column and lines.

Here is the corrected version of the function `_partially_consume_prefix`:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char.isspace() and not char == '\n':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                current_column = 0
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should now properly handle comment indentation while preserving the original formatting.
