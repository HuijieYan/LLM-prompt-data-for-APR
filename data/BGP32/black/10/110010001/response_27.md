### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix based on indentation rules.
2. The function processes each character in the prefix string, updating the current_line and current_column variables accordingly.
3. The bug occurs when the function encounters a newline character while expecting indentation characters. It fails to handle comment lines correctly.
4. The current implementation does not properly handle the case where a comment is on a line by itself.
5. The function needs to accurately track the index of the last non-whitespace character to determine when to return the consumed prefix.
6. We need to modify the logic to correctly handle comment lines and adjust the handling of the last non-whitespace character.

### Proposed Fix:
1. Fix the logic when encountering a newline character to properly handle scenario with a comment line.
2. Update the handling of the last non-whitespace character to ensure correct output.
3. Adjust the condition for returning the consumed prefix to consider proper indentation.
4. Consider edge cases like a single-line comment as the only content.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    last_non_whitespace = 0

    for idx, char in enumerate(prefix):
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                last_non_whitespace = idx
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if last_non_whitespace == idx - 1:
                current_line = ""
                lines.append('\n')
                current_column = 0
                last_non_whitespace = idx
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            last_non_whitespace = idx

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying the corrections, retesting the function should now pass the failing test scenario.
