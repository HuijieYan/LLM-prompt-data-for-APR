### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is supposed to handle indentation levels in Python code, specifically when consuming partial lines of code.
- The error message indicates a failure in the test case related to comment indentation.
- The function is not correctly considering the indentation levels when encountering comments.

### Bug Location:
- The bug is likely located in the section where comments are being handled, leading to the incorrect output in the test case.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs because when a comment is encountered, the function does not correctly handle the indentation level before the comment. As a result, the expected output differs from the actual output in the test case.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that comments are properly handled while maintaining the correct indentation level before the comment.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_line += char
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By handling the newline character correctly when encountered, the function should now process comments and maintain the correct indentation levels, passing the failing test.
