1. **Analysis**:
   - The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is part of the `Driver` class in the file `blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py`.
   - The function is intended to consume a prefix string until a certain column is reached while counting tabs and spaces for column computation.
   - The failing test is related to the alignment of comments which suggests that the function is not handling indentation correctly.

2. **Identified Potential Error**:
   - The function might not handle indentation levels correctly when tabs and spaces are mixed in the input.

3. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - The bug might be caused due to incorrect column calculations when tabs and spaces are mixed within the input.
   - It seems that the function does not take into account the 'column' parameter while consuming the prefix, leading to incorrect alignment.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**:
   - We need to ensure that the function correctly handles both tabs and spaces for indentation levels.
   - Adjust the column counter by considering the actual column number and properly consume the prefix until the desired column is reached.

5. **Corrected Version**:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4) # Adjust for mixed tabs and spaces
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the column counter when encountering tabs and spaces, the corrected function should be able to correctly handle mixed tabs and spaces in the input, which in turn should resolve the alignment issue seen in the failing test.
