### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming a prefix string based on some conditions.
- The function seems to miss handling the indentation correctly.
- The error message shows that the formatting comparison fails due to an incorrect handling of comments in the prefix.
- The expected output has the comment correctly aligned after removing excess indentation.
- The buggy function is not handling comment indentation properly.

### Potential error locations:
1. Handling empty lines.
2. Handling indentation.
3. Handling newline characters.
4. Partially consuming the prefix.

### Cause of the bug:
- The bug is caused by the function not correctly consuming the comment lines and maintaining the correct indentation levels.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Check the logic for handling comments, as they often have special handling requirements.
- Make sure to correctly handle indent levels and newline characters.
- Modify the function to correctly consume partial prefixes according to the rules.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char  # Make sure to add space character if it's not special
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char  # Make sure to add tab character if it's not special
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
            
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Changes Made:
- Modified the conditions for handling newline, space, and tab characters to correctly handle indentation and new lines.
- Updated the logic for building the current line by adding the character in the corresponding block.
- The function now correctly handles newline characters and indentations, consuming the prefix based on the specified column.
