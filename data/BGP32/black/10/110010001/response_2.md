### Analysis:
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function in the `Driver` class is responsible for consuming characters from a given `prefix` string based on indentation levels. The function seems to have a bug that causes it to incorrectly consume characters leading to a formatting mismatch as shown in the error message from the failing test.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of the indentation logic inside the loop.
2. Updating the `current_column` and `current_line` values.
3. Incorrect comparison for `current_column` against the reference column.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug causes the function to consume characters wrongly based on the 'wait_for_nl' flag in a way that deviates from the expected behavior, leading to incorrect output. This incorrect consumption results in a formatting mismatch when processing code with different indentation levels.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles character consumption, updates the `current_column` value appropriately, and respects the indentation levels in the provided prefix string.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_column < column:  # Changed condition for column comparison
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0  # Resetting the column count on a newline
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True  # Indentation is finished
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version adjusts the code to process indentation levels correctly and address the bug affecting the indentation handling. This fix should now pass the failing tests related to code formatting.
