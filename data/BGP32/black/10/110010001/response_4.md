### Analysis
- The `partially_consume_prefix` function within the `Driver` class is intended to consume a prefix of a given string up to a certain column.
- The error message indicates that the function is failing to correctly consume and process the prefix, leading to an incorrect output.
- The function should be properly handling whitespace characters, indentations, and newlines in the prefix string.

### Identified Error
- The function is not correctly handling the case when the comment line is encountered after the required column has been reached. This causes issues in maintaining the correct indentation level in the output string.

### Bug Cause
- The problem lies in the logic that checks when to wait for a newline. If a comment line is encountered before reaching the expected column, the function incorrectly interprets this as the end of the indentation, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Fixing Strategy
- Adjust the logic related to checking and handling comment lines to correctly determine when to wait for a newline and maintain the indentation level.
- Modify the way the function processes the prefix string to ensure correct alignment of lines.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False

        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # Handle the case where comment line is encountered before the expected column
                if current_column < column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
                    current_column = 0
            else:
                # Handle non-indentation characters
                wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should now properly consume the prefix text up to the expected column, including handling cases where comment lines interrupt the indentation process.
