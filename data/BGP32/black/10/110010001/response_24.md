1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to handle the indentation levels in a given block of code defined by the `prefix` argument. It checks each character in the `prefix` and updates the `current_column` to keep track of the current indentation level. If a newline character is encountered, it checks if the current line is empty or not and if the current column is less than the required column value. If the column is not met, it appends the line to a list `lines` and resets the `current_line` string. However, it fails to correctly append the whole line before reaching the column limit.

2. The potential error location is the logic within the `if char == '\n':` block, as it resets the `current_column` but doesn't handle appending the full line to `lines`. This causes the incomplete line to be appended when the method returns.

3. The bug is caused by the premature update of `current_column` and not appending the full line when a newline character is encountered. This results in incomplete lines being added to the `lines` list when the function returns, causing a mismatch in the actual and expected output.

4. To fix the bug, we should ensure that the full line is appended to `lines` before updating `current_column` to 0 when encountering a newline character. This way, all complete lines will be captured correctly.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines) + current_line  # Append the current_line before returning
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)  # Append the full line to lines
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By ensuring that the full line is appended to the `lines` before resetting the `current_column`, the function will correctly capture all complete lines in the `prefix`, resolving the bug.
