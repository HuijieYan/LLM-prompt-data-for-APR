### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix character by character up to a certain column number.
2. The error message indicates a mismatch between expected and actual outputs when consuming prefixes.
3. The function does not properly handle indentation levels and comments, leading to incorrect consumption of prefixes.
4. The bug is caused by incorrect column tracking and handling of spaces, tabs, and newline characters.
5. A strategy to fix the bug is to accurately track the column, handle whitespace characters, tabs, and newline characters properly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if current_column < column:
                if wait_for_nl:
                    if char == '\n':
                        lines.append(current_line)
                        current_column = 0
                        current_line = ""
                        wait_for_nl = False
                elif char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column = ((current_column // 4) + 1) * 4
                elif char == '\n':
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_column = 0
                    current_line = ""
                else:
                    current_line += char
            else:
                current_line += char
        lines.append(current_line)
        return ''.join(lines), ""
```

### Explanation of Modifications:
1. Adjusted the condition to check if the current column is less than the target column.
2. Re-positioned the `wait_for_nl` check to handle newline characters properly.
3. Updated the logic for tab characters to advance the column to the next multiple of 4 correctly.
4. Fixed the handling of newline characters to start a new line and reset the current column.
5. Ensured that the last line is appended to the `lines` list and returned without removing any remaining prefix.
6. By improving the handling of whitespace characters and newlines, this corrected version addresses the bug in the function.
