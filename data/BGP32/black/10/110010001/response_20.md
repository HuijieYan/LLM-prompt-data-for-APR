1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is a method of the `Driver` class located in `blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py`. This function is meant to consume a prefix string until a certain column position is reached in the string. The failure in the test case is due to incorrect handling of whitespace and new lines.

2. Potential error locations in the function include:
   - Incorrect tracking of the current column position.
   - Incorrect handling of different forms of indentation (tabs vs. spaces).
   - Misinterpretation of when to wait for a new line.

3. The cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of the comment indentation after the line with the comment. The function is consuming `\t` as 4 spaces, leading to a difference in the expected and actual results of the formatted string.

4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the way the function handles indentation, tabs, and new lines to accurately consume the prefix string up to the specified column position.

5. Corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                while len(current_line.expandtabs()) < column:
                    current_line += ' '
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 8 - (current_column % 8)
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                while len(current_line.expandtabs()) < column:
                    current_line += ' '
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, res + current_line
```

This corrected version handles the whitespace and newline characters more accurately, ensuring that the comment indentation is preserved correctly.
