### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume characters from a given prefix until a certain column is reached while handling tabs and indents correctly.
2. The bug seems to be related to the handling of newline characters and updating the `current_column` value.
3. The bug causes incorrect handling of newline characters and incorrect calculation of the `current_column` value, leading to incorrect splitting of the prefix.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `current_column` value is updated correctly when encountering newline characters.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Newline encountered, reset current_column
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the `current_column` value properly when a newline character is encountered, the function should now handle the prefix splitting correctly according to the specified column limit.
