The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is that the condition to check for the column value is incorrect. The current implementation only checks the column value after encountering a newline character, which leads to incorrect behavior.

To fix this issue, we need to keep track of the column value for every character processed in the prefix. Then, we can correctly compare the column value with the expected value to determine when to stop consuming characters.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if current_column >= column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            wait_for_nl = True
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should address the issue with checking the column value and ensure that the function correctly consumes characters until the specified column is reached.

The corrected function should now pass all the expected cases mentioned in the test function.
