The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has several issues. One of the main bugs is that it does not correctly handle the indentation levels when consuming the prefix string.

Here's a summary of the issues in the current implementation:
1. Incorrectly updating the `current_column` value based on whitespace characters like spaces and tabs.
2. The function does not handle cases where there is no indentation after a newline character.
3. The logic for resetting the `current_line` and `current_column` values when encountering a newline character is not accurate.
4. The function does not correctly compute the remaining prefix that needs to be consumed.

To fix these issues, we need to adjust the logic of updating `current_column` based on the whitespace characters. Additionally, we need to correctly handle cases where there is no indentation after a newline character. We also need to ensure that the remaining prefix is correctly calculated.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle the indentation parsing correctly and pass the failing test cases provided.
