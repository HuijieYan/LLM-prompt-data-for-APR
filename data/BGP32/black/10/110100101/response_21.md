The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has several issues that are causing it to fail the test. The main problem lies in the logic of handling indentation levels. Here are the identified potential error locations within the buggy function:

1. The `wait_for_nl` flag is not updated correctly based on the indentation characters.
2. The condition to check if the current column is less than the desired column is not handled properly.
3. Handling of tab characters ('\t') is not consistent with the expected indentation levels.

The main cause of the bug is that the function fails to correctly handle the complex indentation scenarios with spaces and tabs.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic related to handling tab characters and updating the column count properly based on different characters encountered.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = ((current_column + 7) // 8) * 8
        elif char == '\n':
            # Unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # Indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these corrections, the function should now be able to handle the given test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
