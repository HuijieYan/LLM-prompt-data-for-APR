The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has a logic flaw in handling the indentation level calculation and newline characters. The function should properly track the indentation level and handle cases where there are multiple tabs or spaces before the comment.

The bug arises when the function encounters a tab (`\t`) character, where it incorrectly increments the `current_column` by 4 instead of 1. This leads to incorrect calculations of indentation levels, causing the function to wrongly identify the end of the indent block.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic inside the function to correctly handle tab characters and adjust the `current_column` accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should handle indentation levels correctly and pass the failing test cases provided above.
