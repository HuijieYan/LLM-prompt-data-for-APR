### Analysis
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is intended to consume a prefix string up to a certain column. It processes the characters in the prefix string and accumulates them until reaching the desired column, considering indentation levels. However, there are several issues in the implementation that lead to incorrect behavior.

### Identified Issues
1. The function does not handle cases where the prefix ends without reaching the desired column.
2. The logic for indentation with tabs (`\t`) is incorrect, as it should add 8 to the current column instead of 4.
3. The condition to check if an empty line is encountered should account for both empty lines and lines with only spaces.
4. The logic to return the remaining prefix after consuming is incorrect, resulting in inconsistent behavior.

### Bug Cause
The function's incorrect handling of different types of indentation characters (spaces, tabs) and the lack of completeness in managing the prefix contribute to incorrect behavior in determining the consumed prefix.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Adjust the logic for handling indentation with tabs to increase `current_column` by 8 instead of 4.
2. Modify the condition to check for empty lines to correctly handle lines that consist only of spaces.
3. Ensure that the remaining prefix returned after consumption is calculated accurately.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            if current_column >= column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 8
            if current_column >= column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            if current_column >= column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the adjustments outlined above, the function should now correctly calculate the consumed prefix up to the specified column and return the remaining prefix string as expected.
