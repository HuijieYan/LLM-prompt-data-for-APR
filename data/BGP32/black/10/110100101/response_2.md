### Analysis
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to partially consume the input prefix based on the specified column. It iterates through the characters in the prefix, handling spaces, tabs, and newlines to determine where to split the prefix. The bug seems to be related to how the function behaves when encountering a newline character.

### Bug Explanation
In the buggy function, when a newline character is encountered, the `current_column` is set to 0 without checking if the line is actually empty. This causes the function to incorrectly handle empty lines, leading to incorrect splitting of the prefix.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles empty lines when encountering a newline character. The `current_line.strip()` condition should be modified to also check if the current line contains only whitespace characters, indicating an empty line.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip():
                    wait_for_nl = True
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly handle empty lines and split the prefix at the specified column.
