### Error Analysis:
1. The function is not correctly handling the indentation levels when determining the number of spaces to consume.
2. The logic to track the current line and column is incorrect, leading to incorrect outcomes.
3. The function fails to correctly identify and consume the prefix based on the specified column value.
4. The issue lies in how the function is handling space and tab characters, leading to incorrect calculations of the current column number.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Make sure to properly update the current column count when encountering spaces or tabs.
2. Correctly track the current line being formed according to the input prefix.
3. Ensure that the function correctly consumes the prefix up to the specified column value.
4. Adjust the logic to accurately handle spaces and tabs in determining the current column number.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if not current_line.isspace() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic inside the function to handle spaces, tabs, and new lines correctly, the corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
