The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is supposed to partially consume a given prefix string based on a specified column value. There are several issues in the current implementation that lead to incorrect behavior. The main issue is with the handling of whitespace characters and newlines.

1. When encountering a newline character ('\n'), the current column count should be reset to 0 instead of continuing the count.
2. The condition for checking if the current column count is less than the specified column is incorrect, leading to an error in determining the consumed prefix.

To fix these issues, we need to adjust the logic for handling whitespace characters, newlines, and column counting within the function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset column count to 0 for newline
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # Check if column limit is reached
            if current_column < column:
                current_line += char
            
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This correction ensures that the function handles newlines and whitespace characters correctly while considering the specified column value.

By using this corrected version of the function, the failing test for comment indentation should pass as expected.
