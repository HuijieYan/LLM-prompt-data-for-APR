### Analysis
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is intended to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column value. The function iterates through the characters in the prefix string and stores lines that meet certain conditions. However, there are issues with how it handles newlines, indentation levels, and line breaks.

### Bug
The bug arises because the function does not properly handle newline characters and track the current column value for proper consumption of the prefix string. This leads to incorrect splitting of the prefix string, resulting in unexpected behavior and incorrect results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles newlines, indentation levels, and updates the current column value accordingly. By tracking this information accurately, the function should be able to consume the prefix string correctly based on the column index.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl or char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                if char != '\n':
                    lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                if not wait_for_nl:
                    current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                current_line += char
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the above corrections, the function should now be able to handle newlines, indentation levels, and properly consume the prefix string based on the given column index.
