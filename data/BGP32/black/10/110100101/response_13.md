### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix until a certain column, keeping track of the lines and the current column. However, there seem to be issues with how it handles new lines and indentation. The function has problems correctly identifying when to stop consuming the prefix.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when the function encounters a new line (`\n`) character. It fails to reset the `current_column` to 0, leading to incorrect column counting and line formation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that whenever a new line character is encountered, the `current_column` is reset to 0.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset current_column to 0
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By resetting `current_column` to 0 when encountering a new line, the corrected function should now properly handle the indentation and line breaks, passing all the test cases.
