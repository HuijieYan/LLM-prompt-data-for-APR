### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume part of a given prefix based on a given column value. The function seems to have a logical error when handling different characters for column tracking and line separation, which leads to incorrect prefix consumption.

### Error:
The main error in the buggy function is in the handling of spaces and tabs for the `current_column` tracking. The logic for updating the `current_column` based on different characters like spaces, tabs, and newlines is causing incorrect results.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `current_column` is correctly updated for each character in the prefix. We also need to handle the case where the column value is lower than the expected column, allowing for proper prefix consumption.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines) + current_line  # Include the line in the result
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:  # Reset current line if column is lower
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version addresses the logic errors in updating `current_column` and ensures correct behavior for consuming the prefix based on the given column value. It should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
