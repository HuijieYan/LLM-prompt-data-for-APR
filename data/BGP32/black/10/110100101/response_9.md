### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix until a specific column is reached, handling indentation with spaces, tabs, and newlines. However, the function has a logical error where it fails to correctly handle the situation when encountering a newline character. This causes incorrect handling of indentation and results in failures in the provided test cases.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the function occurs when encountering a newline character while processing the prefix. The current implementation does not reset the `current_line` and `current_column` when encountering a newline, leading to incorrect calculations and affecting the indentation. This results in the function failing to produce the correct output for the given test cases.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to reset `current_line` and `current_column` to their initial values when finding a newline character. This adjustment will ensure that the function correctly handles indentation and moves to the next line when encountering a newline character within the prefix.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset line and column values when encountering a newline
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By resetting `current_line` and `current_column` when encountering a newline character, the corrected function should now handle indentation correctly and pass the failing test cases.
