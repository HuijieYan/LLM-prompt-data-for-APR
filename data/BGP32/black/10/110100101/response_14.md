### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function when handling the case of waiting for a new line (`wait_for_nl` is set to True) after encountering an indentation character (`char != ' '`, `char != '\t'`). The current logic fails to correctly handle the scenario where the indent is finished with multiple tab characters, leading to incorrect tracking of the current column.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct number of spaces contributed by tabs is added to the `current_column` counter when encountering multiple tab characters. This adjustment should accurately reflect the indentation level, enabling the function to correctly identify when the indent is complete.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
        
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = ((current_column // 8) * 8) + 8
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Proposed Changes:
1. Updated the handling of tab characters (`'\t'`) to increment `current_column` by the necessary number of spaces based on the tab size (in this case, 8 spaces).
2. Ensured that the calculation for `current_column` accurately reflects the cumulative indentation level, hence resolving the bug related to multiple tab characters.
