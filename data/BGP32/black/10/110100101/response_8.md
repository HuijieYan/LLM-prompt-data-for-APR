### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is meant to consume a portion of the input prefix string based on the provided column parameter.
2. The function initializes variables for tracking lines, current line, current column, and whether to wait for a new line character.
3. The function increments the current column based on spaces and tabs, and resets it when encountering a new line character.
4. The function is expected to return the consumed portion of the prefix until the specified column is reached.
5. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles new line characters and when to stop consuming the prefix.

### Bug:
The bug in the current implementation is that it fails to correctly handle the condition where the specified column is reached within the current line. This leads to incorrect processing of new line characters and premature termination of consuming the prefix.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the case where the specified column is reached within the current line before encountering a new line character. This involves properly checking and updating the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` flags to ensure correct consumption of the prefix.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
        if current_column >= column:
            # if column reached within the line
            res = ''.join(lines)
            return res, prefix[len(res):]
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By checking if the `current_column >= column` within the loop and returning the consumed portion when it's reached, the corrected function should now properly consume the prefix up to the specified column.
