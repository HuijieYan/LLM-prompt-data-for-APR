The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the condition for checking if the current line has reached the desired column. The bug causes the function to return an incorrect result when the indentation level changes.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling indentation levels and waiting for a newline character.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ''
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ''
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version now accurately handles the indentation levels and properly waits for a newline character before processing the next line. It should now pass the failing test cases provided.
