The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a given prefix based on a specified column. The issue lies in how the function handles indentations and newlines while tracking the current column.

The bug occurs when the function encounters a newline character while waiting for a newline. In this case, it does not correctly reset the `current_column` to 0 and continue consuming the prefix. This leads to incorrect output where the consumed prefix does not match the expected column.

To fix the bug, we need to reset `current_column` to 0 when encountering a newline character, as this signifies the start of a new line. Additionally, we should continue processing the prefix in all cases to accurately track the current column.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset current_column to 0 for a new line
            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
        
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly consume the prefix up to the specified column point. The function should pass the failing test cases provided.
