### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string until a specific column is reached, taking into account spaces and tabs for indentation. The function seems to have issues handling the conditions for indentation and newline characters.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to incorrect handling of indentation levels using spaces and tabs, resulting in incorrect tracking of the current column position and consumption of prefixes.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Correctly update the `current_column` based on the number of spaces and tabs encountered.
2. Handle the logic for detecting when to stop consuming prefix based on the specified column value.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming 4 spaces for each tab
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic for incrementing the `current_column` and fixing the conditions for stopping consumption of the prefix based on the column value, the corrected function should now handle the indentation correctly and pass the failing test cases.
