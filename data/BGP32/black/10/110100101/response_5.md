### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string until it reaches a certain column number. The function tracks the current line and column number while iterating over the characters in the prefix.

### Identified Issues
1. In the condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column`, the function checks if the stripped `current_line` is not empty before comparing the `current_column` with the `column`. This condition might not handle all cases correctly, especially when dealing with whitespace characters.
2. The `wait_for_nl` flag is not being updated correctly. It should be set to `True` when a non-whitespace character is encountered and `False` when a newline character is found.
3. The handling of tab characters (`\t`) in updating the `current_column` is incorrect. The function should increment the `current_column` by 4 for each tab character.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of tab characters and the `wait_for_nl` flag. When encountering tabs, the function incorrectly increments the `current_column` by 1 instead of 4. This causes the function to misjudge the indentation level of the code.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Update the condition in `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` to properly check the desired alignment based on whitespace characters.
2. Correctly update the `wait_for_nl` flag when encountering different types of characters.
3. Adjust the increment of `current_column` when encountering tab characters.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Increment by 4 for each tab
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False  # Update flag for newline
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True  # Non-whitespace characters indicate new line
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these corrections, the function should now correctly handle the indentation levels based on different types of whitespace characters and ensure that the expected column alignment is maintained.
