## Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column value. The function seems to have issues handling indentation and new lines correctly. The main bug seems to be around tracking the column position and checking for new lines.

## Bug:
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of column values, specifically with tab characters and incrementing the column count. This leads to incorrect behavior when trying to consume the prefix string up to the specified column.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic for handling tab characters to correctly increment the column value by 4.
2. Ensure that new lines reset the current column value and track the correct position after the new line.
3. Adjust the logic to consume the prefix string based on the specified column value.

## Corrected Version:
```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                wait_for_nl = current_column < column
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying the corrections, the function should now handle the prefix string correctly and pass the failing test cases.
