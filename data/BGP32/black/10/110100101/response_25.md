## Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to process a given prefix string up to a certain column number. It keeps track of lines, current line content, current column number, and a flag to wait for a new line. 

The bug seems to occur when the function encounters a newline character. It should handle this case by resetting the current column to zero and checking if the line is not empty before returning the results. 

The failing test case `test_comment_indentation` is checking indentation behavior with tabs and spaces, including comments. It expects correct indentation levels and comment placement.

## Bug
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is not handling the case when encountering a newline character correctly. This leads to incorrect calculations of the current column number and may result in incorrect output or undesired behavior.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the function handles newline characters. When a newline character is encountered, the current column should be reset to zero, and we should check if the line is not empty before returning the result.

## Corrected Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = False
                current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adding an additional check for newline characters and correctly resetting the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables, the corrected function should now handle newline characters properly and pass the failing test cases.
