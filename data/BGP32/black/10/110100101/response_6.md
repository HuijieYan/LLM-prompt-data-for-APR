### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` processes a prefix string character by character until a certain column position is reached, splitting the prefix into lines based on newline characters and indentation levels.
- The bug seems to be related to handling the indentation levels and newline characters while considering the desired column position.

### Issues:
1. The logic to update `current_column` is incorrect, resulting in incorrect indentation tracking.
2. Handling of newline characters and resetting `current_column` is not accurate.
3. The condition to check the current column against the desired column is incomplete.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure correct tracking of the current column based on different types of characters (spaces, tabs).
2. Properly handle the newline characters and update the column accordingly.
3. Implement a complete condition to check if the desired column position has been met.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and char != '\n':
            # Indentation finished, start the next line
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            current_line += char
        
        if not wait_for_nl and current_column >= column:
            break

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version focuses on accurately tracking the current column position, handling newline characters correctly, and breaking the loop when the desired column is reached.
