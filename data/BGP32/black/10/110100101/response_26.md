### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume characters from a prefix string until a certain column position is reached. However, the current implementation has a bug where the function incorrectly checks for the column position. This leads to incorrect slicing and returning of the prefix.

#### Error Location
The bug is primarily in the logic where the function checks for the column position to decide whether to return the consumed prefix or not. The incorrect updating of the `current_column` and the handling of different characters result in incorrect behavior.

### Cause of the Bug
1. The logic for updating `current_column` based on spaces and tabs is incorrect.
2. The logic for detecting when to wait for a newline ends up skipping counting the first character after the newline.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Ensure that the `current_column` is correctly updated based on spaces and tabs.
2. Revisit the logic for handling different characters in the prefix string to properly manage the column position and newline detection.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the adjustments to correctly update `current_column` and handle characters like newline, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and meet the expected input/output values.
