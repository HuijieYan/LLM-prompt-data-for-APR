### Analyzing the Bug

The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string up to a certain column value. However, it has issues with correctly handling the indentation and newline characters, leading to incorrect behavior in some cases.

The function iterates over each character in the prefix string, updating the current line, current column, and checking for spaces, tabs, and newlines. It also keeps track of whether it is waiting for a newline character.

The bug arises when the prefix string contains comments and indentation. Due to the incorrect handling of newline characters and column counts, the function fails to properly consume the prefix up to the specified column value.

### Bug Explanation

In the failing test case `test_comment_indentation`, the function is expected to handle prefixes containing comments with proper indentation. However, due to the incorrect logic in the function, it fails to maintain the correct column count when encountering newline characters within comments, resulting in incorrect prefix consumption.

The function does not reset the current column value when encountering a newline in a comment, which leads to incorrect calculations of column positions and failing to consume the prefix as expected.

### Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to adjust the logic related to handling newline characters within comments. Specifically, when a newline is encountered inside a comment, the function should reset the current column count to prevent incorrect calculations.

Furthermore, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the case when waiting for a newline after the indentation is finished. This will help in consuming the prefix string up to the specified column value accurately.

### Corrected Function

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip():  # check if line is not empty
                current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version includes additional logic to properly handle newline characters within comments and reset the current column count when necessary. Now, the function should be able to correctly consume the prefix up to the specified column value in the failing test cases.
