### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix based on a given column value. The function iterates over each character in the prefix string and updates the `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl` variables accordingly. However, the function has an issue with handling tab characters (`'\t'`) which leads to incorrect identification of indentation levels and waiting for newline characters.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of tab characters causing unexpected indentation depth calculations.
2. Inconsistent updates of variables leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug arises due to the inconsistent handling of tab characters in the prefix string. When encountering tab characters, the function should update the current column by 4 spaces (as specified), but it currently only increments the current column by 1, leading to incorrect indentation levels and parsing issues.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the code to correctly handle tab characters by incrementing the current column by 4 spaces for each tab encountered.
2. Ensure that all relevant variables are updated consistently to reflect the correct state of the parsing process.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            # Update current column by 4 spaces for each tab character
            current_column += 4
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version adjusts the handling of tab characters and ensures that the current column is updated correctly. By making these changes, the function should now correctly consume the prefix based on the specified column value and pass the failing test cases.
