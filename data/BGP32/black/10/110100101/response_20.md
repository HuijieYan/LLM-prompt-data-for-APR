### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is meant to partially consume a prefix string based on a specified column value. The function accumulates characters from the prefix string until it reaches the desired column and then returns the consumed portion and the remaining portion.

One potential issue in the function is related to how it handles whitespace characters such as spaces and tabs in determining the current column. The function does not correctly adjust the `current_column` value when encountering these whitespace characters.

### Bug Explanation
- In the failing test case `test_comment_indentation`, the function is expected to consume a portion of the input prefix string based on the column value. 
- However, due to incorrect handling of whitespace characters (like tabs and spaces) in calculating the `current_column`, the function fails to correctly track the column count.
- This leads to incorrect splitting of the prefix string, resulting in failures to match the expected output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly updates the `current_column` value when encountering different types of whitespace characters. Properly handling both spaces and tabs is crucial for calculating the correct current column position.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
        
        current_line += char
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic for handling whitespace characters and correctly calculating the `current_column`, this fixed version of the function should now correctly process the input prefix string and return the expected split portions.
