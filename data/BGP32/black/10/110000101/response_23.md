### Bug Explanation
The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is mainly due to the incorrect handling of newlines and indentation levels. The function should consume characters from the `prefix` input until a certain column is reached while considering newlines, spaces, and tabs as part of the indentation level. However, in the current implementation, the logic for checking the indentation level and consuming characters is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to properly handle the indentation levels, newlines, and spaces by updating the logic within the for loop. Specifically, we need to correctly track the current column position, consider different types of characters (tabs, spaces, newlines), and update the variables accordingly. Additionally, we should ensure that empty lines are not considered part of the indentation level.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                elif char == '\n':
                    if current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version of the function handles different cases of indentation, newlines, and spaces correctly, ensuring that the function processes the `prefix` input as expected.
