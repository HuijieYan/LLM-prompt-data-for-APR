### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the provided function occurs because the condition to check if `current_column < column` is incorrectly checking if the current column is less than the given column. This condition should be correctly checking if the current column is greater or equal to the given column.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the function, we need to change the condition `if current_column < column:` to `if current_column >= column:` to accurately determine when the prefix needs to be consumed.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column >= column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

Now, the corrected function will properly handle the consumption of the prefix based on the given column position.
