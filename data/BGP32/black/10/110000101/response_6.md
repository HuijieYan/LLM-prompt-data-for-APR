The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix of characters based on a specified column value. The bug in the function arises from incorrectly handling the logic of when to wait for a new line character. This causes the function to return incorrect values in certain cases.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditional statements within the for loop to ensure that the logic for consuming characters and handling new lines is correctly implemented. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function adjusts the conditions and logic within the for loop to ensure that the function correctly consumes the prefix based on the specified column value.
