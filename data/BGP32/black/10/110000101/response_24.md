### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix up to a specified column in terms of spaces and tabs. However, there are multiple issues in the logic of the function that are causing it to produce incorrect results based on the expected values.

### Issues
1. The `wait_for_nl` flag is not being reset properly after encountering a newline character.
2. The condition to check if the current line is not empty and the current column is less than the specified column is incorrect, leading to incorrect handling of lines.
3. Inconsistent updating of `current_column` based on different characters.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Reset the `wait_for_nl` flag after encountering a newline character.
2. Update the condition to correctly check if the current line is not empty and the current column is less than the specified column.
3. Consistently update `current_column` based on the type of character encountered.

### Corrected Version

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and len(current_line.expandtabs()) < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By fixing the issues identified in the original function, the corrected version should now correctly consume the prefix up to the specified column based on spaces and tabs.
