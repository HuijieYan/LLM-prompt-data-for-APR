The bug in the provided function lies in the condition where `if char == '\n':` is used to reset `current_column`. This condition should be outside the check for `wait_for_nl` as it resets the column count for any character, not just for waiting for a newline.

To fix the bug, move the `elif char == '\n':` block outside the `if wait_for_nl:` block.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                elif char == '\n':
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
                
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should now satisfy all the expected input/output values for the provided test cases.
