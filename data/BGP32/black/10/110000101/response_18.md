The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the condition where it determines whether to add the current line to the list of lines or not. The bug causes the function to incorrectly handle the case where the current column needs to be checked against the specified target column.

To fix the bug, we need to update the condition where the current line is added to the list of lines. We should compare the `current_column` against the `column` parameter instead of checking if it is less than `column`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
