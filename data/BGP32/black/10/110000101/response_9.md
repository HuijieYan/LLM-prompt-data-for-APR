### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is supposed to partially consume a prefix based on a given column. It iterates through the characters in the prefix, accumulating them into `current_line`. It uses `current_column` to track the current column position. If it encounters a space or tab, it increments `current_column` accordingly. If it encounters a newline character, it resets `current_column` to 0. The function also sets `wait_for_nl` to True when encountering a non-space, non-tab character, indicating that it's waiting for a newline character to finish the indentation.

### Bug
The bug in this function lies in the condition to check if a newline character is encountered after reaching the target column. The function should check if the \n is encountered after waiting for newline, not before. Additionally, there are issues in accumulating lines and handling the return values.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Move the check for newline character after checking `wait_for_nl`.
2. Update the accumulation of lines correctly.
3. Set the correct values for current_line and current_column.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should now properly handle the cases outlined and satisfy the expected input/output values.
