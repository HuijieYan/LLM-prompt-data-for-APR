### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix string up to a certain column number, considering spaces, tabs, and new lines. However, the implementation has some issues that lead to incorrect behavior. 

The function initializes `current_column` to 0, but it should start at 1 since the indexing usually starts at 1 for columns. Additionally, the current logic for updating `current_column` and checking if the column limit is reached is flawed. 

### Cause of the Bug
1. The function does not handle the case where `column` is `0` correctly. 
2. The logic for updating `current_column` based on tabs is incorrect.
3. The condition for checking if the current line exceeds the target column is flawed. 

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Start the `current_column` from 1 instead of 0.
2. Update `current_column` to increase by 1 for each space character and by 4 for each tab character.
3. Improve the condition for checking if the current line exceeds the target column.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 1  # starting from 1 for columns
        wait_for_nl = False

        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 1
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:  # checking if current line exceeds the column now
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 1
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should now handle the cases listed above correctly and satisfy the expected input/output values.
