### Analysis
1. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string up to a specified column. It separates the consumed lines based on spaces, tabs, and newlines.
2. The buggy code seems to have issues with properly consuming the prefix string while considering the column limit.
3. The bug occurs due to incorrect updating of the `current_column`, `current_line`, and `lines` variables. It fails to properly handle tab characters and does not reset `current_line` after encountering a newline.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling tab characters, reset the `current_line` after encountering a newline, and properly adjust the `current_column` when consuming spaces.
5. Below is the corrected version of the function based on the identified issues.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)  # Adjust for remaining spaces in current tab stop
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the handling of tab characters, properly resetting `current_line` after encountering a newline, and adjusting the `current_column` for spaces, the corrected function should now meet the expected input/output values for all provided test cases.
