### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume the input prefix string up to a specified column.

### Issues
1. In the `if wait_for_nl` condition, the check for `char == '\n'` is incorrect. It should be moved outside the `if wait_for_nl` block to handle empty lines correctly.
2. The logic for updating `current_column` is incorrect for spaces and tabs.

### Bug Cause
The bug causes the function to incorrectly handle line breaks and indentations, leading to incorrect splitting of the prefix string.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Move the check for `char == '\n'` outside the `if wait_for_nl` block.
2. Update the logic for updating `current_column` for spaces and tabs correctly.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        elif wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
