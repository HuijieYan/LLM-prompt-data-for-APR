### Analysis
1. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column position.
2. The function maintains variables like `lines`, `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl` to track the progress of processing the prefix string.
3. The bug occurs when the function fails to correctly handle the condition where it encounters a newline character (`'\n'`), causing incorrect behavior in updating the variables.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly processes newline characters and resets the necessary variables when needed.

### Bugfix Strategy
1. Add proper handling for newline characters (`'\n'`) to reset `current_line` and `current_column`.
2. Reset `wait_for_nl` flag when encountering newline characters.
3. Update the logic to handle the case where waiting for a newline character.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                    continue
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version of the function now correctly handles newline characters and resets the necessary variables where needed. It should satisfy all the expected test cases provided.
