The bug in the provided function is that the `current_column` variable is not properly updated after encountering a tab character. This causes the function to incorrectly calculate the current column position, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to update the calculation of `current_column` when encountering a tab character in the prefix. Tabs should add 4 to the current column position.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # updated to add 4 to column position for tabs
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version now properly handles tab characters and updates the current column position accordingly. It should now satisfy all the expected input/output values provided for the buggy function.
