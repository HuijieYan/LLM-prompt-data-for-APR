The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs when we encounter a new line character and need to reset the `current_column`. The condition `if char == '\n':` incorrectly resets the `current_column` to 0 even before checking if the current line is empty or not. This causes the `column` check to fail and results in incorrect behavior.

To fix this bug, we should move the `current_column = 0` line inside the block where we check if the current line is not empty. This way, we ensure that we only reset the `current_column` when we encounter a new line character on a non-empty line.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
        
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip():
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures that the `current_column` is reset only when we encounter a new line character on a non-empty line. This change should address the bug and satisfy all the expected test cases provided.
