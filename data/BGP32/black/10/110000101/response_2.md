The bug in the provided function lies in the logic for handling the indentation levels and waiting for a new line character ('\n'). The issue arises when the condition for `if wait_for_nl` is met and the character is a space (' '), as it increments the `current_column` without skipping over the spaces in indentation.

To fix this bug, we need to update the conditions in the loop to correctly handle the spaces and tabs for indentation. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should now accurately handle the indentation levels and correctly return the remaining prefix after consuming the necessary characters. It should satisfy all the expected input/output values provided in the test cases.
