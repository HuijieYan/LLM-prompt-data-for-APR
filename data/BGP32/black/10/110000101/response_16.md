### Analysis
The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string up to a certain column value. It processes each character of the input prefix string and accumulates characters until the specified column is reached. However, there are several issues in the current implementation that prevent it from working correctly.

### Bugs Identified
1. The `wait_for_nl` flag is not properly reset after consuming a newline character. This can lead to incorrect behavior in cases where there are consecutive newline characters in the prefix.
2. Lines are not added correctly for cases where the column value is not reached before a newline character.
3. The return statement is not correctly handling the case where the column is not reached.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Reset the `wait_for_nl` flag to `False` after processing a newline character.
2. Change the logic for adding lines to ensure that lines are added even if the column is not reached.
3. Properly handle the case where the column is not reached before the end of the prefix.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)  # Add current_line to lines even if column is not reached
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version of the function addresses the identified bugs by properly resetting the `wait_for_nl` flag after consuming a newline character, ensuring that lines are added correctly, and handling the case where the column is not reached.
