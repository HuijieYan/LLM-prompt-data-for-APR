The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not correctly handling the case where the `wait_for_nl` flag is set to True after encountering whitespace characters. This leads to incorrect handling of line breaks and columns.

To fix the bug, we need to accurately track the current column count and handle the case of encountering a newline character when `wait_for_nl` is True. We should also reset the `current_line` and `current_column` appropriately.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False

        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char

            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                continue

            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly handle the cases specified in the expected values for various prefixes and columns.
