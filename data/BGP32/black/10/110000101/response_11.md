- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column number.
- The function initializes variables `lines` as an empty list, `current_line` as an empty string, `current_column` as 0, and `wait_for_nl` as False.
- It then iterates over each character in the `prefix` string, updating `current_line` and `current_column` accordingly.
- The function uses `wait_for_nl` flag to determine when to consume the prefix based on the column number.
- The function returns the consumed part of the prefix and the remaining part based on the column number.

### Bug Explanation:
- In the buggy function, there is an issue with how the function handles the consumption of the prefix based on the column number.
- The condition for checking if `current_column < column` is incorrect, as it does not account for cases where the column is equal to the specified column number.
- This leads to incorrect consumption of the prefix, resulting in unexpected behavior for cases where the column matches the specified column number exactly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- The condition `current_column < column` should be changed to `current_column <= column` to correctly handle cases where the column matches the specified column number.
- Additionally, the function should be modified to properly handle cases where the prefix ends before reaching the specified column number.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

This corrected version of the function accounts for the cases where the specified column number is reached or exceeded, ensuring the prefix is consumed correctly.
