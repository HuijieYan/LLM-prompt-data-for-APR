### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix text up to a certain column. It iterates over the characters in the prefix, accumulates characters in `current_line` until reaching the specified column, and then returns the consumed part of the prefix and the remaining part.

### Bug Explanation
1. The initial value of `wait_for_nl` is set to `False`, but it should be set to `True` since the function needs to wait for a newline character to determine if the current line should be included in the consumed part of the prefix.
2. In the condition `if wait_for_nl`, the `if char == '\n':` block should be outside the `if wait_for_nl` block to handle the case when a newline character is encountered but `wait_for_nl` is `False`. This is necessary to reset the `current_column` in such cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Set `wait_for_nl` to `True` at the beginning of the function.
2. Move the `if char == '\n':` block outside the `if wait_for_nl` block to handle newline characters properly.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = True
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected function sets `wait_for_nl` to `True` initially and handles the newline character logic correctly. It ensures that the consumed part of the prefix is correctly determined based on the specified column.
