### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string up to a certain column while considering whitespace characters for indentation. However, the function has issues handling different cases, leading to incorrect results.

### Issues
1. The function does not properly reset `current_line` and `current_column` when encountering a new line character (`'\n'`). This can lead to incorrect calculations for indentation.
2. The function does not handle tab characters (`'\t'`) correctly in calculating the current column.
3. The logic to check if the indentation is finished (`wait_for_nl`) is not working as intended.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Reset `current_line` and `current_column` whenever a new line character is encountered.
2. Adjust the column count when encountering tab characters.
3. Adjust the logic to handle when the indentation is finished correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Note
The fixed version of the function should now correctly handle different cases and properly consume the prefix string up to the specified column.
