### Analysis
- The purpose of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is to consume a prefix string up to a specified column value, splitting it into lines based on newlines and considering spaces and tabs for indentation.
- Potential error locations include the handling of spaces, tabs, newlines, and the logic for incrementing the current column value.
- The main cause of the bug seems to be the incorrect calculation of the current column value when encountering spaces and tabs.
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the current column is updated correctly based on the encountered characters.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Update the logic to correctly handle the calculation of the current column when encountering spaces and tabs.
- Make sure to reset the current line and column appropriately when encountering a newline character.
- Adjust the conditions for checking when to append a line to the list.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Adjust for tab size
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version addresses the issues with incorrect column counting and resets the current line and column appropriately when encountering newlines. It should now satisfy all the expected cases provided.
