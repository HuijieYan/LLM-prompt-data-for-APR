### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string up to a certain column number while handling whitespaces, tabs, and newline characters. However, there are multiple issues with the current implementation leading to incorrect behavior.

### Issues
1. In the first if condition, `if wait_for_nl`, the lines are added after encountering a newline character. It should be the opposite; lines should be added when not waiting for a newline character.
2. In the same if condition, `current_column` should be reset to 0 after encountering a newline character, not outside the if condition.
3. The function does not handle cases where the prefix is consumed completely before reaching the specified column, resulting in an incorrect return value.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Move the line concatenation and character checking inside the "not wait_for_nl" block.
2. Reset `current_column` to 0 after encountering a newline character.
3. Handle the case where the prefix is consumed completely before reaching the specified column.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        if not wait_for_nl:
            current_line += char
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                if char == '\n':
                    current_column = 0
        else:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

This corrected version of the function addresses the issues mentioned above and should now correctly handle the prefix string based on the specified column number.
