The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the condition where `wait_for_nl` is set to `True` and `char` is a newline character `\n`. In this case, the current line should be checked against the column before starting a new line. However, the check is misplaced, which leads to incorrect splitting of lines.

To fix the bug in the function, we need to ensure that the current line is checked against the column before appending it to the lines list. This adjustment will correctly handle cases where the current line exceeds the specified column.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char in ['\n', '\r']:
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char in ['\n', '\r']:
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                if current_column >= column:
                    wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function includes the necessary adjustment to properly handle cases where the current line exceeds the specified column.
