The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the logic around handling the indentation level and waiting for newline characters. When encountering a newline character, the function should reset the current column and wait for the next newline character to indicate that the current line has ended.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `if` conditions for different characters. Specifically, when encountering a newline character, we should reset `current_line` and `current_column` to prepare for the next line.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:  # Modified condition for column check
                    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset current_line and current_column for the next line
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should now properly handle the logic for tracking the current line and column position within the prefix string.
