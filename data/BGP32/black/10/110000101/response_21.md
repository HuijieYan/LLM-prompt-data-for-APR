The bug in the provided function `_partially_consume_prefix` is that it does not handle the case where `wait_for_nl` is True and the character is not `\n`. This results in the function not properly updating the `current_column` and `current_line`.

To fix this bug, a strategy would be to add an `else` condition after the `if wait_for_nl` block to handle the case when `wait_for_nl` is True and the current character is not `\n`. In this case, we should set `wait_for_nl` to False and continue updating `current_column` based on the character encountered.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Driver(object):

    # Corrected function
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
            # Add handling for other characters when wait_for_nl is True
            else:
                current_column += 1
                
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now properly handle the cases where `wait_for_nl` is True and the character is not `\n`, ensuring that `current_column` and `current_line` are updated correctly.
