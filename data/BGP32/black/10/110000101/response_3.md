### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is supposed to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column value. However, there are several issues with the logic inside the function that prevent it from working correctly. The function is not updating the `current_column` value correctly after encountering whitespaces or tabs. This leads to incorrect calculations and incorrect splitting of the prefix string.

### Bug
The main issue with the function is that it fails to correctly update the `current_column` value based on the encountered characters. This causes the function to incorrectly split the prefix string.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for updating the `current_column` value based on the encounter of whitespaces, tabs, and newline characters. We should also make sure to properly handle the wait_for_nl flag to determine when to split the prefix string.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 # Adjust tab to 4 columns
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip():  # Only reset column if there is content in the line
                current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By fixing the logic for updating the `current_column` value based on encountered characters and properly handling the `wait_for_nl` flag, the corrected function should now work as expected and satisfy all the provided test cases.
