The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the handling of the conditions for updating the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables. It appears that the logic is not properly tracking the changes in columns and waiting for a new line character.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `wait_for_nl` flag is correctly set when a non-space, non-tab character is encountered. Additionally, the logic for updating the column count needs to be adjusted based on the encountered character.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version includes the necessary fixes in updating `wait_for_nl` and `current_column` based on the encountered characters in the prefix. This version should now handle the scenarios provided in the expected cases.
