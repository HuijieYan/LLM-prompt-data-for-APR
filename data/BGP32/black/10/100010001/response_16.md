### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is meant to partially consume a prefix string based on indentation levels using tabs and spaces. The error message indicates a mismatch in indentation levels within a text block, specifically in handling comments.

### Error:
The bug occurs when the function encounters a comment that requires special handling. The function fails to correctly identify and consume whitespace within a comment block leading to discrepancies in the output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that comments are handled correctly in terms of indentation and spacing.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    in_comment = False

    for char in prefix:
        if in_comment:
            current_line += char
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                in_comment = False
                current_column = 0
            continue

        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '#':
            in_comment = True
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these changes, the function should now handle comments properly and correctly consume prefixes based on indentation levels. This updated version should pass the failing test related to comment indentation.
