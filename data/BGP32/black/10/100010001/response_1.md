1. Analyzing the buggy function: The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to consume the prefix text while considering indentation levels. It appends characters from the prefix to `current_line` until it reaches specific conditions defined by the `wait_for_nl` flag. Once the conditions are met, it generates lines based on the accumulated characters which are appended until the column position is reached. However, the bug seems to be related to how the function handles spaces/tab characters and treats newlines.

2. Potential error locations:
    - Handling of spaces and tabs could be causing the indentation calculation to be incorrect.
    - The condition to check for newline characters and resetting `current_column` might not work as intended.

3. Cause of the bug:
    The bug seems to stem from the logic involving the handling of spaces, tabs, and newlines. Incorrectly updating the `current_column` value based on space and tab characters can lead to incorrect indentation calculations. Additionally, the logic for resetting `current_column` when encountering a newline character seems faulty, which affects the overall consumption and line generation process.

4. Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
    - Ensure accurate calculation of column position when encountering spaces and tabs.
    - Correctly reset `current_column` when a newline character is encountered.
    - Verify the conditions for updating `wait_for_nl` flag, appending lines, and handling indentation levels.

5. Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            continue  # Skip further processing for this character
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Adjust tab character count as required
        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset current_column and allow next line detection
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # Indentation is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By addressing the issues related to handling spaces, tabs, and newlines in the corrected version, the function should accurately consume the prefix while maintaining correct indentation levels.
