There is a bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function related to handling comments in the input prefix string. The bug causes it to incorrectly handle the indentation of comments leading to failing test cases.

Issue:
The function fails to correctly adjust the indentation of comments in the input prefix string. It ignores the indentation of a comment line after finding a newline character ('\n'). As a result, the comment lines are not aligned correctly with the rest of the code lines.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Properly handle the case when a comment starts in the prefix string after consuming whitespaces or tabs.
2. Align the comment line with previous code lines based on the existing indentation level.

Corrected Version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip().startswith("#"):  # Adjust comment indentation
                if len(lines) > 0:
                    current_line = " " * column + current_line.lstrip()
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version updates the function to correctly handle the indentation of comment lines by aligning them properly based on the existing indentation level. This should resolve the bug and pass the failing test case.
