### Analysis:
The error message indicates a failure in the `assertFormatEqual` method of the test, where the expected and actual output strings do not match as they should. This implies that the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is not correctly handling the indentation of comments.

### Error Location:
The bug is likely occurring in how the `wait_for_nl` flag is being handled and how the lines are being appended in the loop. The condition checking for `wait_for_nl` and processing the new line is not correctly handling the indentation level of comments.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the function to incorrectly consume the prefix of the code, leading to a wrong interpretation of line breaks and comments. This issue results in the failing test case where the expected and actual outputs do not match due to incorrect comment handling.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the function handles the `wait_for_nl` flag and how lines are appended in the loop. Specifically, we need to ensure that comments are properly processed and indented according to the original code structure.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False  # Add this line to reset wait_for_nl
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Fix Explanation:
The fix includes adding a line to reset `wait_for_nl` when encountering a new line character that is not part of an indentation sequence. This adjustment ensures that comments are correctly handled in terms of indentation, preventing the bug that led to the failing test case.
