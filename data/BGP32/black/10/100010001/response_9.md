### Analysis:
1. The purpose of the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is to consume a portion of a given prefix based on a specified column.
2. The expected behavior of the function is to remove any leading indentation from the prefix up to the specified column.
3. The function currently fails to correctly handle indentation and newline characters, resulting in a misalignment of expected and actual output.
4. The error message indicates a discrepancy in handling the comment line indentation between the expected and actual output.

### Error Location:
- The issue occurs when encountering a newline character after consuming indentation spaces or tabs.
- The function incorrectly handles the case when there is a comment after the desired column, resulting in the incorrect output.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug arises from the logic to consume the prefix up to the given column while accounting for indentation and new lines.
- The function fails to properly interpret and adjust the column when encountering newline characters followed by comments.
- This leads to the incorrect interpretation of the expected output, causing the failing test scenario.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Revise the logic to correctly handle cases where there is a comment after the desired column.
- Adjust the code to properly skip empty lines and correctly calculate the current column position.
- Update the logic to ensure consistent behavior when encountering newline characters in relation to column position.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            current_line = ""
            lines.append(char)
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

- The corrected version includes adjustments to the handling of newline characters and comments after the specified column.
- The revised logic properly consumes the prefix up to the desired column position while accounting for indentation and newline characters.
- This updated version should address the bug causing the failing test and provide the expected output alignment.
