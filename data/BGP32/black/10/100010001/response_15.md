### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix up to a specified column. The error message from the failing test indicates a discrepancy in indentation handling, specifically related to comments.

### Potential error locations:
1. Incorrect handling of comments when consuming the prefix.
2. Indentation logic within the function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function not correctly handling comments when partially consuming the prefix. When encountering a comment, the function is not skipping over the comment's indentation space, resulting in a misalignment of the two strings.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the function to handle comments separately so that the function can correctly consume the prefix while taking comments into account.
2. Adjust the logic within the function to properly account for the indentation of comments.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    comment_indent = None  # Track indentation level within a comment
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            if comment_indent is not None:
                comment_indent += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            if comment_indent is not None:
                comment_indent += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            if comment_indent is not None:
                comment_indent = None
        elif char == '#':
            comment_indent = current_column  # Record the indentation of the comment
        else:
            # indent is finished
            if comment_indent is not None:
                current_column = comment_indent  # Set the current column to the comment's indentation
                comment_indent = None
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function will properly handle comments and their indentation, ensuring that the prefix is consumed correctly up to the specified column.
