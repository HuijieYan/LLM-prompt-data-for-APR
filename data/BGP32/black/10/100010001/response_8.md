### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume the prefix of a given string up to a specified column number. It keeps track of the current line, current column, and whether it needs to wait for a new line to start. The bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of whitespace characters causing the indentation to change incorrectly.

### Bugs:
1. When encountering a newline character (`'\n'`), the current column is reset to 0. This is incorrect as the indentation level should be maintained.
2. The logic for handling tabs (`'\t'`) is not correctly updating the `current_column` based on the number of spaces represented by one tab.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic to correctly handle newline characters (`'\n'`) without resetting the current column to 0.
2. Update the logic to properly calculate the number of spaces represented by tabs (`'\t'`) and adjust the `current_column` accordingly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Assuming one tab = 4 spaces
                current_column = current_column // 4 * 4  # Adjust based on tab stops
              
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic to handle newline characters correctly and adjusting the calculation for tabs, the corrected function should now accurately consume the prefix without introducing unnecessary changes to the indentation level. This should address the bug and allow the test to pass.
