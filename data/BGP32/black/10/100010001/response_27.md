### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to handle lines of code and characters based on indentation levels. It processes the input `prefix` to partially consume it up to a certain column. The error arises from incorrect handling of the indentation levels using spaces and tabs. The function does not properly handle the scenario where a comment is encountered within an indented block, which results in an unnecessary removal of newline characters.

### Error Location:
The bug occurs when the function encounters a comment (`#`) within the indentation. It incorrectly removes newline characters and does not maintain the original structure of the code.

### Bug Cause:
The primary cause of the bug is the handling of the wait for a new line (`wait_for_nl`) flag. When the function encounters a comment in an indented block, it prematurely splits the lines by treating the comment line as complete.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic within the function to properly handle comments within indented blocks. Specifically, we need to accurately detect when a comment is on the same line as code and maintain the correct line structures while processing the prefix.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    comment_count = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':
            comment_count += 1
        else:
            if comment_count > 0:
                wait_for_nl = True
                comment_count = 0
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By including a `comment_count` variable and adjusting the handling of comments within the function, the corrected version should now properly maintain the original structure of the code even when encountering comments within indented blocks. This correction should resolve the error encountered in the failing test.
