### Analysis:
- The error message indicates a failing test related to comment indentation.
- The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is likely responsible for incorrect handling of comments during indentation processing. 
- The bug appears to be related to the function not correctly accounting for comments when calculating indentation levels.


### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the function does not handle comments properly when calculating indentation levels. 
- As a result, when encountering comments, the function does not adjust the indentation level correctly, leading to incorrect output.


### Strategy to Fix the Bug:
- Modify the logic in the function to properly handle comments and adjust the indentation level accordingly.
- When a comment is encountered, ignore it for the purpose of calculating indentation, ensuring that the correct indentation level is captured.


### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    in_comment = False  # Track if inside a comment
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if in_comment:
            if char == '\n':
                in_comment = False
        elif wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '#':
            in_comment = True
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic to skip incrementing the `current_column` when encountering a comment symbol (`#`), the corrected version of the function should now handle comment indentation correctly. This modification should ensure that the function captures the correct indentation level even when comments are present.
