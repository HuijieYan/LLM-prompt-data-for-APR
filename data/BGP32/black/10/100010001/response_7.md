The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume part of a given `prefix` string based on a certain `column` value and return the consumed part along with the remaining part of the prefix.

### Error Analysis:
The error message indicates a test failure in the `test_comment_indentation` test case. The `assertFormatEqual` method is expecting the prefix consumed by the buggy function to match the expected indentations but is failing due to an incorrect consumption of the prefix.

### Bugs in the Buggy Function:
1. The condition `current_line.strip()` needs to check for whitespace characters instead of stripping the line. This condition is misplaced and causing incorrect prefix consumption.
2. The `indentation` related code for counting spaces and tabs is not properly handling the indentation level due to improper tracking of columns.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the condition for checking non-whitespace characters.
2. Implement proper tracking of columns for indentation levels.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.rstrip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0  # Reset column count for a new line
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making these modifications to the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, the bug should be addressed, and the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
