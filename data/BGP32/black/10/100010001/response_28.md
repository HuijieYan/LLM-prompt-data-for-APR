### Analysis:
1. The error message is related to the `assertFormatEqual` method failing to match the expected and actual output strings.
2. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for processing the input code snippet and fixing the indentation issues.
3. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of whitespace characters, either tabs or spaces.
4. The strategy for fixing the bug would involve ensuring that the correct number of spaces is added to maintain consistent indentation in the output.

### Bug Fix:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    while current_column < column:
                        current_line += ' '  # Add spaces to maintain column alignment
                        current_column += 1
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Updated indentation for tabs
        elif char == '\n':
            # Handle empty line
            while current_column < column:
                current_line += ' '  # Add spaces to maintain column alignment
                current_column += 1
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    if current_line.strip():
        while current_column < column:
            current_line += ' '  # Add spaces to maintain column alignment
            current_column += 1
        lines.append(current_line)
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the `_partially_consume_prefix` function as shown above, the bug related to incorrect handling of whitespace characters should be fixed, ensuring proper indentation in the output and resolving the failing test case.
