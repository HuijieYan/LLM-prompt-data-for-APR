### Analysis:
The `assertFormatEqual` test is failing due to a mismatch in the indentation of comments between `contents_tab` and `contents_spc`. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for handling the indentation of comments, which is causing this test failure. The function is not correctly consuming the prefix text based on the indentation columns.

### Potential Error Location:
The issue in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be related to how it handles the indentation for different characters like space (' '), tab ('\t'), and newline ('\n'). The incorrect handling of these characters results in the failure of properly identifying the indentation level for comments.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. The function does not correctly track the column count for arbitrary spaces (' ') and tabs ('\t').
2. When encountering a newline character ('\n'), the function resets the current column to 0, leading to incorrect tracking of the indentation level of comments.
3. This causes the function to not properly match the expected output with the actual output in the test case.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Maintain a separate counter for spaces and tabs to accurately calculate the width of the column.
2. Adjust the logic for handling newline characters to correctly distinguish between actual indentation level changes and simple newline breaks.
3. Ensure that the function correctly consumes the prefix text based on the determined column width.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    space_count = 0
    tab_count = 0

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                space_count = 0
                tab_count = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            space_count += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            tab_count += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            if space_count or tab_count:
                current_column += space_count + tab_count * 4
                space_count = 0
                tab_count = 0
            else:
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
        else:
            current_column += space_count + tab_count * 4
            space_count = 0
            tab_count = 0
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By maintaining separate counters for spaces and tabs, as well as adjusting the handling of newline characters, the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now pass the failing test case.
