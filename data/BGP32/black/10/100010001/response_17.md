### Analysis:
- The function `_partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column)` is responsible for partially consuming a prefix string up to a certain column value.
- The failing test is related to checking the indentation of comments in code.
- The error message shows that there is a difference in behavior when handling comments in the code.
- The function seems to handle indentation levels, but it fails to handle comments correctly.

### Bug Identification:
- The bug seems to arise when the function encounters a comment within the prefix string.
- The function does not correctly handle comments and their effect on the indentation levels.
- The bug is likely located in the logic that tracks the current column and waits for newline characters.

### Bug Explanation:
- When the function encounters a comment character (`#`), it sets the `wait_for_nl` flag to `True`. It expects to see a newline character after a comment to reset the column count.
- However, in the case of comments, the newline character is part of the comment and not a separate entity. This causes the function to miscalculate the column indentation level for the comment line.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling comments.
- When a comment character (`#`) is encountered, instead of waiting for a newline character, we should ignore the rest of the line as it is part of the comment.
- This adjustment will ensure that comments are correctly handled, and the column count remains accurate.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    in_comment = False  # Track if currently inside a comment
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        
        if in_comment:
            continue  # Skip processing characters inside comment
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '#':
            in_comment = True
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            in_comment = False  # Reset comment flag at end of line
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By introducing the `in_comment` flag and skipping processing characters within a comment, the corrected version of the function should handle comment indentation correctly, thus passing the failing test case.
