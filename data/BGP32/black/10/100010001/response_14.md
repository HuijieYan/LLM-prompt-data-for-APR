### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is supposed to partially consume a prefix string based on specific indentation rules.
2. The test failing due to a mismatch in indentation which caused by a leading `#` symbol in the prefix string but the function is not handling it correctly.
3. The cause of the bug is that the function is treating the comment line differently and not properly handling the special case where a comment line starts with `#`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic within the function to correctly handle the case when encountering a comment line in the prefix string.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Identify the case when a comment line is encountered (when a `#` character is seen in the prefix).
2. Handle the comment line separately by checking if it is located before or after the expected column.
3. The function needs to correctly determine whether to include the comment line in the consumed lines or not.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        
        # Handle cases based on the current character
        if wait_for_nl:
            # Check if reaching a new line
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            # Increment column count for spaces
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Increment column count for tabs
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Handle new line, reset column count
            if not current_line.lstrip().startswith('#'):
                current_column = 0
        elif char == '#' and not current_line.strip():
            # Handle when comment line is found
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adding a condition to check for comment lines and correctly handling them in the function, the corrected version should now pass the failing test.
