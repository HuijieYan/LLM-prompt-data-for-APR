### Analysis:
1. The `partially_consume_prefix` function is used to consume a prefix based on a given column value.
2. The error message indicates a mismatch in the indentation for a comment between the expected and actual strings.
3. The bug seems to occur when the function encounters a comment line after consuming prefixes. It fails to handle the indentation of the comment properly.
4. A potential fix involves adjusting the logic in the function to correctly handle the indentation of comment lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic for handling comment lines to maintain the correct indentation.
2. Update the function to correctly consume prefixes, including handling tabs, spaces, and newlines.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Handle newline by resetting the column and waiting flag
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # Handle other characters and reset the waiting flag
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    # Check the remaining line if ends while waiting for newline
    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
        res = ''.join(lines)
        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

Applying the above fix should address the bug related to comment indentation mismatches. Now the `partially_consume_prefix` function should correctly consume prefixes while maintaining proper indentation for comments.
