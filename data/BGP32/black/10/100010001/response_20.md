### Analysis:
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is used to handle the indentation levels correctly while converting tabs to spaces.
2. The error message indicates a failure in handling comments with different levels of indentation.
3. The function is not correctly handling the case where a comment is encountered before reaching the desired indentation level.
  
### Bug:
- The current implementation does not account for comments in the prefix part, leading to incorrect results when there are comments with different levels of indentation. 

### Fix:
- To fix the bug, we need to account for comments in the prefix while processing the indentation levels.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    comment_indent = None
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            comment_indent = None # Reset comment indentation
            wait_for_nl = False
            current_column = 0
        else:
            if char == '#':
                comment_indent = current_column
            elif comment_indent is not None and current_column <= comment_indent:
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By introducing the `comment_indent` variable, we can correctly handle comments with different levels of indentation. This correction allows the function to consider comments properly while processing the prefix for indentation levels conversion.
