## Analysis:
The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a given `prefix` string based on a specified `column` in order to manage indentation levels. The bug in the function seems to be related to incorrect processing of lines based on tab characters (`\t`) and spaces.

## Error Location:
The bug likely lies in how the function handles tab characters (`\t`) and spaces within the `prefix` string.

## Cause of Bug:
The bug causes the function to incorrectly handle indentation levels when tab characters and empty lines are encountered. This leads to the incorrect output, as seen in the failing test.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly interprets tab characters and spaces while handling indentation levels. This can be achieved by properly updating the `current_column` value when encountering tab characters and spaces.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_column

```

By updating how the `current_column` value is calculated when encountering tab characters (`\t`), the corrected function should now handle indentation levels correctly. This should address the bug and enable the function to pass the failing test.
