### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the comment indentation is incorrect when comparing the expected output to the actual output. This suggests that the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not handling the comment indentation properly. 

### Issues:
1. Comments are not being handled correctly and are causing a mismatch in indentation.
2. The condition to wait for a newline character to signal the end of indentation is incorrect.

### Cause of the Bug:
The function does not account for the correct handling of comments in the input prefix. When encountering a comment, the function doesn't properly check for the indentation level and incorrectly processes the comment lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic of handling comments to ensure they are properly aligned based on the column.
2. Adjust the condition for detecting the end of indentation after encountering a comment to avoid incorrect alignment.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    in_comment = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif in_comment:
            if char == '\n':
                in_comment = False
            current_column += 1
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':
            in_comment = True
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version now properly handles comments and adjusts the indentation according to the expected column. This modification should address the bug and ensure that comment indentation is correctly preserved.
