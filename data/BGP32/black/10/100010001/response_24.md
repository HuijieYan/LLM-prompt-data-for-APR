### Analysis:
The `partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to consume spaces and indentation in a prefix string until a specific column is reached. However, the bug here is related to the handling of comments in the input prefix.

### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `partially_consume_prefix` function occurs when it encounters a comment in the input prefix. When encountering a comment, it should wait for a newline character before considering it as part of the consumed prefix. However, the current implementation does not handle comments correctly, leading to an incorrect consumed prefix.

In the failing test example, the function fails to properly consume the comment line before the next line, which results in a discrepancy in the consumed prefix when compared to the expected result.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, the function needs to correctly handle the special case where a comment is encountered. The function should wait for a newline character after a comment is encountered before considering it as part of the consumed prefix.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    in_comment = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False

        elif char == ' ' and not in_comment:
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t' and not in_comment:
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if in_comment:
                in_comment = False
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':
            in_comment = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By checking for the comment character '#' and setting a flag `in_comment`, the corrected version ensures that comments are handled correctly in the input prefix. This fix allows the function to wait for a newline character after consuming a comment before considering it as part of the consumed prefix.
