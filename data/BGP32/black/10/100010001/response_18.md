### Analysis:
The error message indicates that there is a mismatch between the expected output and the actual output of the `fs` function when called with `contents_tab`. The issue seems to be related to how comments are handled within the `fs` function. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for managing prefixes, which may include comments.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of newline characters within the function.
2. Logic for identifying when an indent is finished.
3. Handling of comments within the prefix.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be related to the handling of comments. When encountering a comment character ('#'), the function incorrectly sets `wait_for_nl` to `True`, thinking it has reached the end of the indent. This results in the comment being included as part of the current line, causing the indentation levels to be incorrect when generating the formatted string.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic in the function to correctly handle comments. One approach could be to treat comment characters as part of the current line without resetting the `wait_for_nl` flag. This will ensure that comments do not break the logic of determining the end of an indentation level.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == '#':
            # Treat comment characters as part of the line without ending the indent
            continue
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making this adjustment, the function should now correctly handle comments without prematurely ending an indent block, which should address the bug causing the failing test.
