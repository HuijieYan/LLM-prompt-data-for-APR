### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string up to a specific column, handling indentation levels with spaces and tabs. The error message from the failing test indicates a discrepancy in formatting related to comments. This suggests that the function is not correctly handling comments when consuming the prefix up to a specific column.

### Identified Issue:
The issue with the current implementation is that when encountering a comment character `#`, the function does not properly handle the remaining characters until a newline `\n` is encountered. This leads to incorrect consumption of prefix text when comments are present.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function so that when it encounters a comment character (`#`), it continues consuming characters until a newline character (`\n`) is found. This will ensure that comments are included in the consumed text up to the specified column.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    in_comment = False  # Track if within a comment block
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif in_comment:
            if char == '\n':
                in_comment = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':
            in_comment = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying the above corrections to the function, it should now handle comments correctly when consuming the prefix up to the specified column. This should resolve the formatting discrepancy observed in the failing test.
