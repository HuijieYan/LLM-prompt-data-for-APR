### Analysis:
The `partially_consume_prefix` function is intended to consume a prefix string up to a certain column, taking into account different types of characters such as spaces, tabs, and newlines. The error message from the failing test indicates that the indentation of comments is not being handled correctly after a dedent.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of comments within the function based on indentation levels
2. Logic for processing characters such as spaces, tabs, and newlines

### Bug Cause:
The function `_partially_consume_prefix` does not correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent, leading to incorrect formatting. This causes the assertion error in the test case related to comment indentation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
We need to ensure that comments are properly aligned after a dedent operation and that the indentation levels are maintained correctly based on the input. This requires adjusting the logic within the function to properly handle comments and indentation changes.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and char.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming the tab width is 4 spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True 
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By correctly handling the newline characters and updating the logic to consider comments and indentation levels, the corrected version of the function should now properly consume the prefix string with correct indentation and alignment. This should resolve the issue related to incorrect comment indentation after a dedent.
