### Analysis:
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function in the `driver.py` file is intended to consume a prefix string up to a certain column and adjust the indentation levels based on spaces and tabs. The bug is likely causing the indentation of comments to be incorrectly adjusted after a dedent operation. This is leading to failing tests related to comment indentation in a specific scenario.

### Potential Error Location:
The issue may be related to how the `wait_for_nl` flag is handled when encountering a newline character in the prefix string.

### Bug Cause:
Based on the error message and the GitHub issue, the bug is likely related to the handling of comments when they should maintain the same indentation level as the subsequent code. The `wait_for_nl` flag mechanism seems to be incorrect, which is causing the comment to be treated as if it's part of the dedent process.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic related to the handling of comments and their indentation levels. Specifically, we need to ensure that comments are not affected by the `wait_for_nl` flag that is intended for waiting for a newline character to start a new line with correct indentation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            if current_line.lstrip().startswith("#"):
                lines.append(current_line)  # Append comment line without adjusting indentation
                current_line = ""
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True  # Start waiting for a newline
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True  # Indent is finished
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Summary:
In the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we now properly handle comments by not adjusting their indentation level and allowing them to be appended as-is. This modification should fix the bug related to comment indentation after a dedent operation and pass the failing test scenario.
