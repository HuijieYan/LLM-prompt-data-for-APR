### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming the prefix of a string based on indentation level.
- The error message indicates a specific test case failure related to comment indentation after a dedent.
- The GitHub issue further elaborates on the problem where comments are incorrectly indented after a dedent when the input file uses tabs.

### Error Cause:
- The bug occurs because the function does not correctly handle the indentation level for comments when using tabs.
- When encountering a comment after a dedent, the function fails to maintain the correct indentation, causing the comment to be aligned differently than expected.

### Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the function handles the indentation level for comments after a dedent.
- Ensure that comments are aligned correctly based on the overall indentation level of the code.
- Update the logic to correctly handle tabs and maintain the expected comment indentation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column//4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            if char == '#':
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                wait_for_nl = False                  
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Result:
- The corrected version of the function should now correctly handle the comments' indentation after a dedent when using tabs.
- The test case that resulted in the error should now pass, successfully resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
