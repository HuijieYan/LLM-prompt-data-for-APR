### Analysis:
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is responsible for parsing the input prefix and determining the current column position within the text. The bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of comments and whitespace characters.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition for handling comments might be incorrectly structured.
2. The logic for updating the column count may be incorrect.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of comments in the `prefix`. When encountering a comment that starts with a `#`, the function incorrectly assumes that it marks the end of indentation, resulting in incorrect column counting.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Adjust how comments are handled within the loop to ensure that the correct column count is maintained.
2. Update the logic for managing column counts after encountering comments.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        # Handle comments separately
        elif char == '#':
            current_line += char
            while len(prefix) > 0 and prefix[0] != '\n':
                current_line += prefix[0]
                prefix = prefix[1:]

        else:
            # indent is finished
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True

    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, current_line
```

This revised version of the function includes a new block of code to handle comments separately and maintain the correct column count. Now, comments that start with `#` will not prematurely reset the column count. This corrected version should resolve the indentation issue described in the GitHub issue and pass the failing test.
