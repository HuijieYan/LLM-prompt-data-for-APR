### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming a given prefix based on certain conditions. The function is used to handle indentation in the context of transforming code indentation.

###  Identified Bugs:
1. The function is not correctly handling the indentation of comments after a dedent.
2. The existing logic is not correctly checking and maintaining the indentation level of comments while parsing the prefix.

### Explanation:
The error message from the failing test indicates that the indentation of comments after a dedent is not being handled properly, resulting in incorrect output. Specifically, in the failing test case, the comment indentation is not matching the expected output after the dedent.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for handling comments and maintaining their correct indentation level. The function should accurately identify and adjust the indentation level for comments based on the surrounding code structure.

### Correction:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ' or char == '\t':
            current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else 4
        elif char == '\n':
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = char.isspace()
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By modifying the logic to accurately handle the indentation of comments after dedent, this corrected function should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
