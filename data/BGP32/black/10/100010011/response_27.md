## Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is used to process a prefix string until a certain column limit is reached. The bug seems to be related to indentation processing, specifically with handling comments that are not indented correctly after a dedent operation.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The logic for handling the indentation level after a dedent operation.
2. The logic for processing comments and preserving their indentation.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to occur when a comment is encountered after a dedent operation. In the original implementation, when `char` is equal to '\n', the `wait_for_nl` flag is set to True indicating that the previous line is finished and the function should wait for a new line before checking the column limit. This logic is not correctly handling the scenario where a comment follows a dedent, resulting in incorrect indentation of the comment in the output.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the logic correctly handles indentation after a dedent, especially when comments are involved. We need to properly handle the indentation level and the presence of comments in the prefix string.

## Corrected Version:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if wait_for_nl:  # Check if a comment is expected
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:  # Process the dedent and the following new line
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, I have added an additional check in the 'elif char == '\n'' block to differentiate between the scenarios where a comment is expected (wait_for_nl = True) and where it is not. This helps in correctly handling the indentation for comments after a dedent operation.
