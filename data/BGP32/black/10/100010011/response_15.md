## Analysis:
1. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming a prefix based on specified rules.
2. The error message indicates a failure in asserting the equality of the expected formatted content with the actual formatted content.
3. The bug occurs when handling the lines followed by comments in the input. This results in incorrect indentation of comments after a dedent.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that comments are properly handled after dedent operations in the provided function.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Refactor the conditional logic when handling comments to ensure correct indentation.
2. Adjust the rules for line continuation after dedent to maintain proper comment indentation.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char in {'\n', '#'}:
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the conditional logic to properly handle comments after dedent operations, the corrected function should now pass the failing test case and resolve the GitHub issue related to incorrect comment indentation.
