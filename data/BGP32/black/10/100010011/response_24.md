### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming prefixes in the context of indentation levels in Python code.
2. The error message indicates that the indentation for comments after a dedent is being changed incorrectly.
3. Based on the GitHub issue, the problem occurs when the code uses tabs for indentation, leading to unexpected behavior when formatting comments.
4. The bug seems to stem from the handling of tab characters and their impact on the calculation of the current column.
5. To fix the bug, we need to adjust how tab characters are handled and ensure that comments are correctly aligned with the code block they belong to.
   

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the function `_partially_consume_prefix` to correctly handle the indentation level when encountering tab characters.
2. Update the logic to ensure that comments are properly aligned based on the existing indentation level.
3. Incorporate a fix to address the specific issue raised in the GitHub report regarding the incorrect indentation of comments after a dedent.


### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            if not current_line.strip() and not lines:
                continue
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        else:
            break
        current_line += char

    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
        lines.append(current_line)
        current_line = ""

    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

### Changes Made:
1. Updated the handling of tab characters by adjusting the calculation of `current_column` based on the current indentation level.
2. Improved the logic for correctly aligning comments within the code block.
3. Ensured that comments are maintained at the appropriate indentation level, especially after a dedent operation.

By implementing these changes, the corrected function should address the reported bug related to incorrect comment indentation after a dedent in the presence of tab characters.
