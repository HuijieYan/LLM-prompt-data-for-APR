### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is used in the codebase to handle the consumption of characters based on different indent patterns.
- The error message indicates a mismatch in the expected and actual indentation levels of comments after dedent in the input code.
- The GitHub issue raises a concern about incorrect changes in the indentation of comments after a dedent, particularly when tabs are used in the input file.

### Identified Bug:
- The bug lies in the logic of handling comments within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function.
- When encountering a comment after a dedent, the code incorrectly does not adjust the indentation level of the comment.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Update the logic to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent.
- Ensure that the comment indentation matches the next line's indentation after a dedent operation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The buggy function corrected
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            if char == '#':  # adjust comment indentation after dedent
                current_line = current_line.lstrip()
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### After fixing the bug:
- The corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now handle comment indentation correctly after a dedent operation.
- This fix addresses the reported issue related to incorrectly changing the indentation of comments after a dedent, especially when tabs are used in the input file.
