### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming a given prefix based on the specified column, especially when encountering new lines or spaces. The bug seems to occur when handling the scenario of a comment line with insufficient indentation after a `'\n'` character.


### Identified potential error locations:
1. The logic in the `if wait_for_nl` block might not correctly handle the case where a comment line lacks sufficient indentation after a newline character.
2. The incorrect handling of indentation levels for comments is likely the root cause of the failing test case.


### Cause of the bug:
The bug causes incorrect behavior when processing comment lines that do not have proper indentation after a newline character. The function fails to maintain the correct indentation level for the comment line, leading to a discrepancy between the expected and actual output.


### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles comment lines with respect to their indentation level after encountering a newline character. Adjusting the logic to preserve the correct indentation would resolve the bug.


### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line # Include current_line
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By including `current_line` when res is calculated, we ensure that the comment line after a dedent will maintain the correct indentation level. This corrected version should now pass the failing test case and resolve the reported issue on GitHub.
