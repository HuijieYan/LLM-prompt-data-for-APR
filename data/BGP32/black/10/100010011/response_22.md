### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for consuming the prefix of a block, keeping track of the current line and column. The bug seems related to the incorrect handling of comments with tabs in the input text.

### Error Location:
The error seems to occur in the `current_column` calculation logic when encountering tabs or spaces. The function should correctly calculate the indentation level of the comments to match the following code.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to stem from the incorrect calculation of `current_column` when encountering tabs or spaces. This leads to an incorrect indentation level for comments after a dedent in the input text.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we should ensure that the calculation of `current_column` properly handles tabs and spaces to maintain the correct level of indentation for comments. Additionally, we need to adjust the logic to correctly handle comments after dedents.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Adjust for correct tab handling
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.lstrip().startswith('#'):  # Adjust for comments after dedent
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the calculation of `current_column` to correctly handle tabs and spaces, and adjusting the logic to account for comments after dedents, the corrected function should now handle the formatting issue described in the GitHub issue.
