### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming a specified prefix while keeping track of the current line and column. The function checks for different characters in the input prefix string such as spaces, tabs, and newline characters. The bug seems to be related to handling the indentation of comments after a dedent.

### Potential Error Locations:
- Incorrect tracking of current column and line positions.
- Incorrectly handling comments and their indentation.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs when processing prefix strings that contain comments and indentation changes. In the provided GitHub issue, the input code snippet uses tabs for indentation. When there is a comment after a dedent, the comment's indentation is being modified incorrectly by the function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation of comments after a dedent. This may involve adjusting the logic related to tracking column positions, handling comment indentation, and detecting dedents.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Adjusted to handle tabs properly
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""  # Update current_line irrespective of indentation
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished or comment
            if not wait_for_nl and not current_line.strip():
                current_line = char  # Adjust current_line for comments
            else:
                wait_for_nl = (char != '#')  # Skip indenting comments
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the handling of tabs, comments, and line breaks, the corrected version of the function should appropriately process the input prefix and avoid the incorrect comment indentation issue.
