#### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to handle prefix parsing and indentation in Python code. The error message from the failing test indicates that the function is not correctly preserving the indentation for comments after a dedent.

#### Error Location:
- The issue seems to be related to the handling of tabs and spaces for indentation within the function.
- Particularly, the condition where `elif char == ' ':` and `elif char == '\t':` should both increase the `current_column` count, but the current implementation only increases the count for spaces.

#### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incomplete handling of tab characters (`'\t'`) in the function. When the function encounters a tab character, it should increment `current_column` by a fixed amount (4 spaces in Python convention), but the current implementation neglects this. This leads to incorrect indentation treatment for comments after a dedent.

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that tabs are handled properly for indentation counting in the function. By adding the appropriate logic to handle tab characters (`'\t'`) in the code block, we can ensure that the function correctly parses the prefix and preserves the indentation for comments after a dedent.

#### Corrected Version:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Increment by 4 for tab character
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the above correction, the function now correctly increments the `current_column` count by 4 when encountering a tab character, ensuring that the function handles indentation consistently for both spaces and tabs. This correction should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test.
