### Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function when handling tab characters (`\t`). The function incorrectly counts tabs as 4 characters while updating the current column position. This leads to incorrect handling of indentation levels for comments when the input uses tabs instead of spaces.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of tab characters (`\t`). The function should increase the `current_column` by 4 when encountering a tab character, but it is currently increasing it by 4 regardless of the current position. This results in misaligned comments when tabs are used in the input text.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic for handling tab characters (`\t`) to increment the `current_column` by the appropriate amount (4 spaces per tab).
2. Refactor the indentation checking logic to ensure that comments are correctly aligned with the following code.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_column = (current_column // 4) * 4  # Ensure alignment to next tab stop
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic for handling tab characters and aligning the indentation to the next tab stop, the corrected function should now correctly handle tabulated comments after a dedent.
