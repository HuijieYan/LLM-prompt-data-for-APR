### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for part of the problem described in the GitHub issue. It fails to handle the correct indentation of comments after a dedent when tabs are used. This error results in incorrect formatting by shifting the comment indentation one level to the left compared to the code block indentation.

### Error Cause:
1. The function fails to correctly handle the case where a comment is placed after an indented block.
2. It does not take into consideration the existing indentation level of the code when processing comments.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic within the function to correctly handle comments following an indented block.
2. Adjust the algorithm to maintain the correct indentation level for comments.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Description of Changes:
1. Added an additional check when encountering a newline character to handle cases where comments should maintain the same level of indentation as the code block.
2. Updated the condition for returning the result to consider the indentation level of the current line.

By making these changes, the corrected function should now properly handle the indentation for comments after a dedent, as described in the GitHub issue.
