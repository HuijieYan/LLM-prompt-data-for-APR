### Analysis:
1. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` appears to be responsible for consuming a prefix string based on specific rules involving indentation and new lines.
2. The error message indicates a failed test related to comment indentation, where the comment is not aligned correctly after a dedent operation.
3. The GitHub issue highlights a similar problem where Black reformats the code incorrectly, specifically affecting comments after a dedent.
4. The bug seems to occur when handling tabs and spaces in the input code.
5. The current implementation may not correctly handle the indentation levels when dealing with tabs and spaces, leading to incorrect output.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused due to the incorrect handling of indentation levels (tabs and spaces) when consuming the prefix string in `_partially_consume_prefix` function. This leads to misalignment of comments after a dedent operation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the logic for handling tabs and spaces to ensure consistent indentation processing.
2. Adjust the conditions for identifying the indentation level and managing new lines to align the comments correctly.
3. Maintain the correct indentations even after dedent operations.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip():
                    if char == ' ' or char == '\t':
                        if current_column < column:
                            res = ''.join(lines)
                            return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the function `_partially_consume_prefix` has been updated to address the indentation handling issues. By ensuring proper management of tabs, spaces, and indentations, the corrected function aims to produce the expected output without causing misalignment of comments.
