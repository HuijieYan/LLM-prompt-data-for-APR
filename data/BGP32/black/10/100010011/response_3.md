## Strategy for fixing the bug:

Based on the error message and the GitHub issue description, the bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of comments indentation after a dedent when using tabs in the input code. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for handling the partial consumption of the code prefix, and the bug may lie in the logic related to handling tab characters that affect indentation.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that comments maintain the correct indentation levels following a dedent, particularly when using tabs. We should modify the logic related to tab characters in the `current_column` calculation and make sure that comments are properly indented.

## Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Adjust column based on the number of spaces for a tab character
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
                continue
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the corrections made to properly handle the tab character calculations and maintain correct comment indentation, this corrected version of the function should resolve the reported bug and produce the expected output.
