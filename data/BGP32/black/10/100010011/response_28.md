### Analysis:
The buggy `_partially_consume_prefix` function is responsible for partially consuming a given prefix based on indentation levels. The bug is causing incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent operation. This issue is causing failing tests related to comment indentation in the code.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The logic for handling comment indentation may not be correctly capturing the required behavior.
2. Incorrect handling of wait_for_nl variable may lead to issues with the expected behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is causing comments after dedent levels to be improperly formatted. The issue arises when the function encounters a '#' character and fails to correctly adjust the indentation level. This results in failing tests related to comment indentation in the code.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, it's necessary to ensure that the function correctly handles the adjustment of indentation levels for comments. This can be achieved by refining the logic of handling comments, ensuring that their indentation aligns with the surrounding code after a dedent operation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    in_comment = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char

        if in_comment and char != '\n':
            current_column += 1
            continue

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                in_comment = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':
            in_comment = True
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Changes Made:
1. Added `in_comment` variable to properly handle the state of being in a comment.
2. Included logic to skip counting indentation levels within comments.
3. Adjusted the logic to handle comments properly after a dedent.

By making these changes, the corrected version of the function should resolve the bug related to comment indentation during dedent operations.
