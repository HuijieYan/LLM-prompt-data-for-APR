### Analyzing the buggy function:

The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming the input prefix up to a specified column while handling tabs and newlines appropriately. The bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of comments indentation after a dedent operation.

### Potential error locations:
1. Incorrect handling of comments indentation when encountering a newline.
2. The logic for detecting a change in indentation level might be flawed.

### Bug cause:
The buggy function fails to maintain the correct indentation level for comments that follow a dedent operation. When the comment is encountered after a dedent, the function does not adjust the indentation of the comment correctly, leading to incorrect output.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Track the current indentation level and adjust it when encountering a newline after a dedent.
2. Make sure the logic for incrementing the current column based on spaces and tabs is correctly implemented.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if wait_for_nl:
                # adjust comment indentation after a dedent
                if current_column < column:
                    spaces_to_add = column - current_column
                    current_line += ' ' * spaces_to_add
                    current_column += spaces_to_add
                wait_for_nl = False
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the corrected version of the function above, the issue reported in the GitHub thread related to incorrect comment indentation after a dedent operation should be resolved. This version ensures that the comment indentation aligns correctly with the next line after a dedent.
