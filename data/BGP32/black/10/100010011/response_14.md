### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to handle indentation and line prefixing in a Python source file.
- The error message indicates a failing test related to comment indentation when using tabs.
- The GitHub issue reports a similar problem where comments are not correctly aligned after a dedent operation when tabs are used.

### Potential Error Locations:
- Incorrect handling of tab characters may be causing the issue with comment indentation.
- The logic for tracking indentation levels and newline characters could be flawed.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The buggy function does not handle tabs (`\t`) properly when determining the correct column for indentation.
- When encountering a tab character (`\t`), the function incorrectly adds 4 to `current_column` instead of adjusting it based on the existing indentation level.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Correctly handle tab characters by adjusting the `current_column` based on the existing indentation level.
- Ensure that comments are correctly aligned with the code when there is a dedent operation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if wait_for_nl:
            current_line += char
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # Adjust the column based on the existing indentation level
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function includes a fix for adjusting the `current_column` when encountering tab characters. It now correctly handles the indentation levels, which should address the issue with comment alignment after a dedent operation.
