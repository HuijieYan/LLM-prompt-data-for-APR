### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is used to partially consume the prefix of a given text block based on a specified column value. The function is intended to handle newline characters, spaces, and tabs while maintaining the correct indentation level. However, there seems to be an issue with handling comments that leads to incorrect indentation.

### Error Cause:
The function `_partially_consume_prefix` fails to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent operation. This is causing the indentation of comments to change unexpectedly after the dedent. The failing test case `test_comment_indentation` specifically highlights this issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that comments are handled correctly when the code is dedented. We should modify the logic related to waiting for a newline character and handle the indentation levels appropriately.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    pending_indent = 0
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = pending_indent
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # dedent check for comments
            if char == '#' and current_column < column:
                pending_indent = current_column
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By introducing the `pending_indent` variable and updating the logic to handle comments correctly during dedenting, we should be able to address the issue reported in the failing test and the associated GitHub issue.
