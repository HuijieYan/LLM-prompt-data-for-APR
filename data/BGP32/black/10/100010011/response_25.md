### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix while maintaining the correct indentation level.
- The error message indicates a failing test related to comment indentation.
- The GitHub issue describes a scenario where comments are not properly aligned after dedent when using tabs.

### Bug Cause:
1. The buggy function does not handle comments indentation correctly after dedent, especially when using tabs.
2. The function does not consider the indentation level of the comment when waiting for a new line after dedent.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic to handle comments indentation correctly after dedent.
2. Adjust the code to preserve the indentation level of comments when processing prefix.

### Corrected Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                if current_line.strip().startswith('#'):
                    lines.append(' ' * column + current_line.lstrip())
                    current_column = column
                else:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_column = 0

                current_line = ""
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Summary:
The corrected function now properly handles comments after dedent, preserving their indentation level. This should resolve the failing test related to comment indentation alignment when using tabs.
