### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is used in the process of consuming characters from a given prefix. The issue reported on GitHub is related to incorrect handling of comments indentation after a dedent when using tabs instead of spaces.

### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the logic related to handling comments and indentation levels. The function is not correctly preserving the indentation of comments after a dedent operation when the input contains tabs. This results in the incorrect reformatting of the comments, causing the test to fail.

### Bug Cause:
The function fails to properly handle the indentation levels when encountering comments after a dedent operation. This causes the comments to be misaligned with the surrounding code. The issue arises due to the logic for tracking whitespace characters and newline characters not accounting for tabs and spaces consistently.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function accounts for both tabs and spaces when tracking the indentation levels and processing comments. By correctly identifying the whitespace characters and managing the column count, we can preserve the correct indentation of comments after a dedent operation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assume tab width is 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle tab characters (assumed tab width of 4) along with spaces, we ensure that the comments' indentation is preserved accurately after a dedent operation. This correction should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and enable the function to pass the failing test.
