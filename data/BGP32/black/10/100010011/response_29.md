### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming a given prefix based on column and indentation. The function is used in the context of parsing and formatting code. The error message indicates an issue with comment indentation after a dedent operation, which is likely related to incorrect handling of line endings and whitespace characters.

### Identified Bug:
The bug seems to occur when there is a comment at a specific indentation level, and after a dedent operation, the comment indentation is not preserved as expected. This is likely due to the logic in the `elif char == '\t'` block where tabs are not handled correctly when computing the current column.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function does not consider tab characters correctly when calculating the current column position. When a tab character is encountered, the current column should be increased by 4 instead of 1.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic handling tab characters in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. When encountering a tab character, we should increment the `current_column` by 4 to correctly reflect the tab width.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Handle tab character correctly
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying this correction, the function should handle tab characters correctly, which should resolve the indentation issue with comments after a dedent.
