### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming the given prefix based on the indentation level. The error message indicates an issue related to comment indentation after a dedent, which matches the GitHub issue description.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of comments within the function.
2. Logic related to indentation tracking.
3. Issues with identifying and updating the correct indentation level.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of comments after a dedent in the `prefix`. The logic in the function fails to maintain the correct indentation level for comments, resulting in incorrect output. This bug is aligned with the GitHub issue where incorrect comment indentation is reported specifically after dedents.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, changes need to be made in the logic related to handling comments and tracking the correct indentation level. Specifically, the function should correctly account for comment lines and their indentation levels relative to the code lines.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            if current_line.strip().startswith('#'):
                wait_for_nl = True
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic to set `wait_for_nl = True` when encountering a comment line after a dedent, the corrected version ensures that comment lines are correctly indented based on the column level provided. This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and align with the requirements of the failing test.
