### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming a given prefix based on indentation.
- The function incorrectly handles the indentation when encountering comments after dedentations.

### Identified Bug:
- The bug causes incorrect handling of comments after dedentations, leading to improper indentation for the comment lines.

### Root Cause:
- The issue arises from the logic that marks the end of the indentation and waits for a new line.
- When processing comments after dedentations, the function fails to correctly align the comments with the subsequent lines.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the logic related to handling comments after dedentations to ensure proper alignment with subsequent lines during prefix consumption.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Handle unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            if lines:
                if lines[-1].strip().startswith('#'):
                    lines[-1] = lines[-1].strip()
                else:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
        else:
            # indentation is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Correction Rationale:
- The corrected version ensures that comments are correctly aligned with subsequent lines after dedentations by addressing the processing logic for comments and newline characters.
