### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the "assertFormatEqual" test function failed to match the expected and actual outputs. The specific issue is related to comment indentation after a dedent when using tabs in the input file.

Looking at the buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix`, the logic for handling tab characters (`\t`) seems to be the root cause of the issue.

The GitHub issue further confirms that the problem is related to incorrect comment indentation after a dedent when the input file uses tabs.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of tab characters (`\t`) within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. When a tab character is encountered, the current_column count is increased by 4, leading to incorrect indentation calculations and subsequent misalignment of comments.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic related to tab characters (`\t`) in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. Instead of increasing the current_column count by 4 for each tab character, it should align the indentation correctly based on the existing indent level.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Calculate the correct indent level based on existing indent
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Updated Function Explanation:
- The correction in the `elif char == '\t':` block ensures that the indentation calculation aligns with the current indent level. It calculates the correct number of spaces needed to reach the next multiple of 4 spaces based on the existing indent level.
- By adjusting the tab character handling, the corrected function should now properly preserve comment indentation after a dedent, especially when using tabs in the input file.

After applying this fix and updating the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, the issue reported on GitHub related to incorrect comment indentation should be resolved.
