### Analysis:
1. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string and separate it into lines based on specific conditions. 
2. The error message indicates a discrepancy in the indentation of comments between the expected output and the actual output.
3. The buggy function fails to correctly handle comments when there is an indentation change, resulting in the incorrect separation of lines.
4. The strategy for fixing the bug involves properly tracking and handling the indentation level of comments within the prefix string.

### Correction:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Update:
The correction in the function involves removing the condition `if char == '\n'` inside the `elif` block and moving it into a separate block outside the `elif` conditions. This change ensures that every line, including those with newline characters, are properly handled and appended to the `lines` list.
