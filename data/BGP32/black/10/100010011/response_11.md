### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming the prefix up to a certain specified column. The function is likely causing issues with the handling of whitespace characters such as tabs and spaces, leading to incorrect indentations in comments.

### Error Cause:
The error message indicates a difference in the expected output due to incorrect indentation of comments after a dedent. This can be linked to the way the function `_partially_consume_prefix` processes whitespace characters, especially tabs and spaces.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Correctly handle the counting of spaces when encountering tab characters to ensure proper indentation.
2. Adjust the logic for tracking the current column to properly account for different whitespace characters.
3. Ensure that comments are correctly indented based on their context within the given prefix.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line += char
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming each tab is counted as 4 spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            current_line += char
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the adjustments in the corrected version, the function should now correctly handle whitespace characters and maintain the correct indentation for comments, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
