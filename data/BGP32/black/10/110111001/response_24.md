### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function causes incorrect handling of indentation levels with comments when consuming the prefix string. The function fails to properly handle the scenario where a comment is present at the end of an indented block followed by the next line without any indentation. This leads to discrepancies between the expected and actual output.

### Bug Location
The issue lies in the block of code that handles the case when the function encounters a newline character (`\n`) while parsing the prefix string. In this block, the function fails to properly reset the `current_line` and `wait_for_nl` flags, leading to incorrect parsing of subsequent lines with varying indentation levels.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly reset the `current_line` and `wait_for_nl` flags when encountering a newline character. Additionally, the function should properly handle cases where a comment is present at the end of an indented block.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip():
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the parsing of the prefix string, ensuring consistent behavior with varying levels of indentation and comment positions.
