### Analysis:
- The buggy function is `_partially_consume_prefix` that is supposed to partially consume a prefix string based on the provided column value.
- Based on the failing test `test_comment_indentation`, the function is not handling the case correctly where a comment is encountered before the expected column.
- The bugs are likely related to the indentation handling within the function that affects the proper consumption of the prefix.

### Bug Cause:
- The function fails to correctly handle the indentation level for comments before or at the expected column position.
- The function prematurely exits or consumes the prefix without properly checking the specific column position.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Adjust the logic in the function to correctly handle different scenarios of indentation and the presence of comments before reaching the expected column position.
- Ensure that the function accurately tracks the current column and waits for the appropriate newline characters.
- Update the function to process the prefix string accurately based on the column requirements.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation and comment scenarios, the corrected version should now pass the failing test `test_comment_indentation`.
