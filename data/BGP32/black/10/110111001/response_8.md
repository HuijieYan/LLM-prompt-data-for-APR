### Explanation:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix()` is not correctly handling cases where the current column exceeds the desired column value for indentation. When encountering a character that signifies the end of the indent (like a space or tab), it is setting `wait_for_nl` to `True` but is not correctly updating the `current_column` value, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `current_column` is updated properly when encountering characters that signify the end of the indent. Specifically, we need to reset `current_column` to 0 when encountering a new line character or when the current line does not meet the required column indentation.

### Corrected Code:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                elif char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the `current_column` correctly in all relevant cases, this corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
