### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is causing the failing test `test_comment_indentation` to raise an assertion error. The function fails to correctly handle the indentation levels when encountering comments in the prefix content, leading to incorrect results in the returned final string.

The main issue is in handling comments. When a comment is encountered, the function resets the `current_column` which should not be the case. This causes the columns to be misaligned, resulting in incorrect output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to update the logic within the function to correctly handle the increment of the `current_column` when encountering spaces or tabs without resetting it when a comment is encountered.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            if char != '#':  # Check if char is not a comment
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying the corrected version of the function, it should now handle comment characters correctly and align the output based on the given column value. This will ensure that the function can properly process the prefix content as expected.
