### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix based on a given column value. However, the function fails to correctly handle cases where comments are involved, leading to incorrect output.

### Bugs identified:
1. The function fails to properly handle the situation when encountering a comment after consuming some characters based on the column value.

### Bug Cause:
The function fails to update the `lines` list after encountering a comment in the input prefix. This results in incorrect output when extracting the consumed prefix.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. We need to update the `lines` list when encountering a comment to ensure that the consumed prefix includes the comment as well.
2. Adjust the logic to correctly handle comments and update the line list accordingly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:  # Modify condition to include comments
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':  # Update to handle comments
            # Include comment in the current line
            current_line = current_line.rstrip()
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the `_partially_consume_prefix` function with the corrected logic to handle comments correctly, the function should now produce the expected output for the failing test cases.
