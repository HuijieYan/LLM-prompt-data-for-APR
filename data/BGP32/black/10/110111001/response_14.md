### Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in how it handles indentation and new lines while trying to consume a prefix up to a specific column. The logic for handling white spaces, tabs, and new lines is causing the function to incorrectly handle the indentation of comments, leading to the failing test cases.

Here are the main issues causing the bug:
1. The function does not correctly handle the case where the current column exceeds the target column while waiting for a new line. This results in incorrect behavior when formatting the code.
2. The function does not properly handle spaces and tabs, leading to inaccurate column tracking and incorrect splitting of the prefix.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to address the following:
- Adjust the logic to correctly track the current indentation column.
- Handle the case where the current indentation exceeds the target column, specifically when waiting for a new line to finish indentation.
- Properly process spaces and tabs to ensure accurate column tracking.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # handle exceeding column here
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic to handle exceeding the target column correctly and adjust the indentation tracking, we can address the issues causing the failing tests.
