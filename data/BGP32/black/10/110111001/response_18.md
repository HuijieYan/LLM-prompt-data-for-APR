### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string up to a certain column, keeping track of the current line and column position. It seems like there is an issue where the logic to handle the waiting for a new line is not working as expected, leading to incorrect line splitting.

### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to be related to the handling of waiting for a new line when the indentation is finished. This causes an issue where the last line might not be properly stored leading to discrepancies in the output when comparing with the expected value in the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for waiting for a new line to ensure that the correct behavior is implemented when handling new lines and line breaks. Additionally, we need to make sure that the last line is properly stored before returning the result.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By modifying how the waiting for a new line is handled, ensuring that the last line is properly stored and returned, this corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should address the bug and pass the failing test.
