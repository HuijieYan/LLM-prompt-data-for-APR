### Explanation
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` fails to correctly handle the indentation of the comment lines in the input prefix. It incorrectly processes the lines and columns, leading to incorrect output.

In each case provided, the function is not able to properly handle the indentation for comments in the input prefix. This leads to the error in the failing test since the expected output contains the correct indentation for comments while the function returns an incorrect result.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to ensure that it correctly identifies and handles the indentation for comments. One approach is to keep track of the indentation level of the lines and use this information to determine the correct output. Additionally, we need to consider cases where the comment lines might have different indentation levels than the preceding lines.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip().startswith('#'):
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should be able to handle the indentation of comment lines correctly and pass the failing test provided.
