### Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the logic related to handling the indentation of comments. The function incorrectly treats consecutive spaces before a comment as part of the comment's indentation. This causes a mismatch between the expected output and the actual output in the failing test cases where the comment indentation differs.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the function to correctly handle the indentation of comments while consuming the prefix string.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the adjustment in the corrected version above, the function should now correctly handle the indentation and consume the prefix string as intended. This should address the issue causing the failing test cases.
