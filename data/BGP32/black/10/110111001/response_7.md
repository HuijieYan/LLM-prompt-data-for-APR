### Error Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to split a given `prefix` string at a specific `column` position based on whitespaces and newlines. The function fails to correctly handle comment lines in the input. The issue arises when encountering a comment line that is intended to be part of the split, but it doesn't get processed correctly.

In the failing test case, the comments are not being handled properly due to the function not considering comments as part of the `prefix` to be split at the specified `column`. This results in an incorrect output, causing the assertion to fail.

### Bug Explanation
The bug is caused by missing handling of comment lines in the function. Comment lines are not being treated as actual content to be considered for splitting, leading to discrepancies between expected and actual outputs in the failing test cases.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to include comment lines in the splitting logic. Comments should be treated the same way as other parts of the `prefix`, ensuring that they are correctly included in the split result if the `column` condition is met.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n' or char == '#':
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            current_column += 1

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version includes the check for comment lines (`#`) by setting the `wait_for_nl` flag to true. Now comments will be treated as part of the splitting process, ensuring that they are correctly included in the output when the `column` condition is met.
