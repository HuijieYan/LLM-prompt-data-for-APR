### Explanation of the Bug
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function causes it to incorrectly handle the indentation of comments. When reaching a comment line, the function fails to correctly adjust the indentation level based on the preceding code.

In the failing test `test_comment_indentation`, the function fails to correctly consume the prefix for comment lines when there is a mix of tabs and spaces within the indentation. This causes the function to return a different result than expected, leading to an assertion error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the function needs to properly handle the indentation while consuming the prefix of the input string. To do this, we need to adjust the logic inside the loop that iterates over the characters of the prefix string.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the handling of tabs and spaces to update the `current_column` correctly and ensuring the function tracks the indentation level accurately, the corrected function should now fulfill its intended functionality. This corrected version should now pass the failing test `test_comment_indentation`.
