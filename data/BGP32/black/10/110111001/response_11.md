### Bug Explanation:
The bug arises from how the function handles the case when encountering a newline character (`'\n'`). When encountering a newline character, the function should reset the `current_line` and `current_column` variables instead of incrementing `current_column` as if it was a space or tab. This behavior leads to incorrect processing of the indentation level.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Add a condition to reset `current_line` and `current_column` when a newline character is encountered.
2. Update the handling of newline characters to correctly reset the variables and conditions.

### Corrected Function:

```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                elif char == '\n':
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
