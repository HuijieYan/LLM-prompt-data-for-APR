### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not correctly handling the case where a comment line has leading spaces or tabs followed by the comment itself. It fails to skip the initial indentation before the comment when comparing the column position, leading to a discrepancy in the output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in handling leading whitespaces before a comment line. We should skip over these leading whitespaces when checking the column position to correctly determine if we should wait for a newline before considering the comment line to be fully consumed.

### Corrected Function:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ' or char == '\t':
                current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these corrections, the function should now handle the indentation before a comment line correctly and pass the failing test cases.
