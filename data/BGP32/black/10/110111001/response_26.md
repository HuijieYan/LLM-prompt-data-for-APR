### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume the input prefix up to a certain column value, preserving the rest of the prefix and possibly adjusting line breaks based on indentation. However, the function is not handling the case where a line contains only white spaces in the correct manner, leading to incorrect output.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function incorrectly handles lines with only white spaces (tabs or spaces). When encountering a line with only white spaces, the function is not properly updating the current column count, leading to incorrect behavior in determining the consumed prefix.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic that handles lines with only white spaces so that the current column count is updated correctly as intended. By correctly updating the current column count in such cases, the function should be able to correctly consume the prefix up to the specified column value.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            if current_line.strip():
                current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            if current_line.strip():
                current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now properly handle lines with only white spaces, correctly updating the current column count and consuming the prefix up to the specified column value.
