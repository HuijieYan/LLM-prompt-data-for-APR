### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix until a certain column using specific rules.
2. The function initializes variables `lines`, `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl` to track the progress of consuming the prefix.
3. The bug seems to be related to the handling of a newline character that causes unexpected behavior in preserving the indentation when consuming the prefix.
4. The function fails to correctly preserve the indentation when encountering a newline character.
5. The function should maintain the correct indentation level when splitting the original prefix.

### Bug:
The bug is located in the part of the code that handles the condition for a newline character. When encountering a newline character, the function resets the `current_column` to 0 instead of maintaining the correct indentation level.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when encountering a newline character, the function preserves the current indentation level based on the last non-empty line consumed.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                # Maintain the correct indentation by setting current_column to the last non-empty line indentation
                current_column = len(current_line) - len(current_line.lstrip())
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            # Ensure handling of empty lines to preserve indentation
            if current_line.strip():
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By making these adjustments, the corrected function should now correctly maintain the indentation level when splitting the prefix, resolving the bug observed in the failing test.
