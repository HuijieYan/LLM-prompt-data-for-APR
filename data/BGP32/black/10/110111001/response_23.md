### Explanation:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string up to a certain column, splitting it into lines based on newline characters and whitespace. The bug lies in the logic where the function checks for indentations. When encountering a whitespace character, it increments the `current_column` value, which is used to track the current column position. However, the logic is not correctly handling the case of encountering a tab character (`\t`), where the column increment should be 4 instead of just 1.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to update the logic in the conditional block for tab characters (`elif char == '\t':`) to correctly increment the `current_column` by 4. This adjustment will ensure that the column tracking aligns with the expected behavior for both spaces and tabs.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic for tab characters ('`\t`'), we ensure proper handling of both spaces and tabs in the indentation tracking process. This corrected version should now correctly parse the prefix string according to the specified column and resolve the failing test case.
