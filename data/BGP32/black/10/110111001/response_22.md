### Analysis:
The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string until a certain column value is reached, handling indentation with spaces, tabs, and newlines while preserving the original structure. It fails to correctly handle cases where there is an indentation level difference between consecutive lines with comments.

### Bug:
The main issue lies in the conditional statement `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column`, which is incorrectly checking only the current line's properties. When a line contains only a comment or includes a comment, the check may incorrectly return a substring of the original prefix. This behavior leads to incorrect output in cases where comments affect the indentation level.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure proper tracking of both the current line and the cumulative lines to handle indentation accurately.
2. Adjust the condition for checking the cumulative column count to correctly account for indentation within comments.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

With this corrected version, the function should now handle the indentation correctly, including cases where comments affect the indentation level. This update ensures that the cumulative lines correctly represent the original structure, resolving the issue of incorrect substring extraction.
