### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume part of a prefix string based on a specified column value. However, it has several issues that lead to incorrect behavior:

1. The function does not properly handle the case where the prefix is entirely consumed by the current line, resulting in missing content in the output.
2. The logic for updating the current column based on spaces and tabs is flawed, leading to incorrect column calculations.
3. The function doesn't correctly handle the case of an unexpected empty line.

### Bug
The bug arises from not correctly tracking the consumed content in the prefix when the column value condition is met. This results in missing content in the final output and subsequently failing the test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly consumes the prefix content based on the column value, correctly updates the column position while considering spaces and tabs, and handles unexpected empty lines appropriately.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 1  # Start from 1 to account for 1-based indexing
        wait_for_nl = False

        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column > column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 1
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Assumed tab width as 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if not current_line.strip():
                    lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 1
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic to track consumed content correctly, handle column calculations accurately, and manage empty lines appropriately, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test case provided.
