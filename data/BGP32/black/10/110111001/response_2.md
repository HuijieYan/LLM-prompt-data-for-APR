### Explanation:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix up to a certain column while handling indentation and newlines. However, the logic to handle indentation is faulty, particularly when encountering a comment. The function fails to handle comments correctly when comparing the whitespace of the comment to the target column.

### Bug:
The bug arises when the function encounters a comment line. Instead of correctly indenting the comment line based on the target column, the function does not take into account the leading whitespace characters of the comment while determining the indentation level. This results in incorrect handling of comments and failing the test cases where comments are present in the prefix.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the indentation of comment lines based on the target column. When encountering a comment line, the function should compare the effective indentation (ignoring leading whitespaces that do not contribute to the actual indentation level) to the target column.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and len(current_line.expandtabs()) <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line)  # Add the empty line to lines
            current_line = ""
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By correcting the handling of comments and properly comparing the effective indentation level, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases.
