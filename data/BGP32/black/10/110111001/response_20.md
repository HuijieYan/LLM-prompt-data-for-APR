### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs due to mismanagement of the indentation level. Specifically, the function incorrectly handles cases where there are spaces before comments. In these scenarios, the function doesn't properly account for the additional indentation caused by these spaces.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the function tracks the current column position to accurately reflect the indentation level. Additionally, we need to handle cases where spaces precede comments to ensure the correct behavior.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # Handle leading spaces in comments correctly
                current_column = len(current_line) - len(current_line.lstrip())
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function properly handles the indentation tracking and accommodates scenarios where spaces precede comments, ensuring the function functions as expected.
