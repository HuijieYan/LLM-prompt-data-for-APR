### Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in how it handles the indentation levels in the input `prefix` string. The function is intended to consume text up to a certain column, but it fails to correctly handle lines that have different indentation levels. The function incorrectly indicates the end of an indentation level as soon as a non-space character is encountered, leading to premature line breaks and incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic of the function to correctly handle the indentation levels and line breaks. We should track the current indentation level and wait until a newline character is encountered before breaking the line. Additionally, we need to append the `current_line` to `lines` only when a newline character is encountered. 

### Corrected Version:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # Update the current_column and wait_for_nl
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                # Removed the premature line break
                pass
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making these adjustments in the corrected version, the function should now correctly consume the input prefix up to the specified column, handling different indentation levels properly.
