### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is due to the handling of the indentation while waiting for a new line character. The function incorrectly includes the indentation level of the current line when processing the end of the previous line, resulting in incorrect comparison and slicing of the prefix string. This causes the function to return the wrong result, leading to assertion errors in the test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when the function encounters a new line character, it correctly resets the `current_column` variable to 0 and discards the current line's indentation before evaluating the new line's indentation. This will ensure that the correct prefix string is extracted and returned.

### Corrected Function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res.strip(), prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines).strip(), current_line
```

With this corrected version of the function, the mentioned bug should be fixed, and the failing test cases should pass without any assertion errors.
