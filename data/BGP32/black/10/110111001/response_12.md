### Bug Explanation:

The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is causing incorrect behavior when the input prefix contains indented comments. The function fails to correctly consume the indented comment lines and handle leading whitespaces before comments. This leads to a mismatch between the expected and actual output in the failing test related to comment indentation.

### Bug Location:
The bug is in the logic that handles waiting for a new line after encountering an indent character. The condition `wait_for_nl` should be set to `True` only after encountering an indent character, not immediately after any character.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, adjust the logic in the loop that processes each character of the prefix. Ensure that `wait_for_nl` is set to `True` only after encountering an indent character and reset it when a new line starts or for empty lines. Update the handling of column count to include the proper indentation levels.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if wait_for_nl:
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_line += char
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic in the corrected version, the function will correctly consume the prefix, handle indentation, and properly process comments to pass the failing test related to comment indentation.
