### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the handling of the indentation levels and line breaks. The function is designed to consume a prefix until a specific column is reached, but it fails to correctly track the indentation and handle newlines. This leads to incorrect outputs when extracting the prefix.

The issue stems from the logic around the `wait_for_nl` variable, which is used to indicate when the function should wait for a newline. The condition for waiting for a newline is set when a non-space and non-tab character is encountered. However, this does not properly handle cases where the newline is at the same indentation level as the current content.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to adjust how the function handles the `wait_for_nl` condition and how it processes newlines and indentation. Specifically, we need to ensure that the function correctly tracks the current column and handles cases where there is no indentation between lines.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = [] 
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix: 
        current_line += char 
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column: 
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line) 
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_spaces = False
        elif char == ' ': 
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t': 
            current_column += 4 
        elif char == '\n': 
            # unexpected empty line 
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line) 
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_spaces = False
        else: 
            # indent is finished 
            wait_for_nl = True 
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the logic to correctly handle newlines and indentation levels, the corrected function should now accurately consume the prefix up to the specified column.
