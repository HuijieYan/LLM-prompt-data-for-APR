### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from not correctly handling the case when an empty line is encountered. The current implementation resets `current_column` to 0 when encountering a newline character, assuming that a new line should start. However, for the specific test case provided, when a comment is present on an empty line, the correct behavior should be to ignore the empty line and continue parsing the following line.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling newline characters in a way that empty lines are correctly handled when comments are present. We should not reset `current_column` to 0 for empty lines but continue parsing the next line as if the empty line was not encountered.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n' and current_line.strip():
            # ignoring empty lines with only whitespace
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By modifying the condition for handling newline characters and including logic to skip empty lines containing only whitespace characters, this corrected version should pass the failing test case accurately.
