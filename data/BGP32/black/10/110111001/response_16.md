### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume characters from a given `prefix` until a specific `column` limit is reached. The bug arises from the incorrect handling of indentation spaces and tabs within the prefix string. The function fails to properly calculate the column position in cases where there are tab characters (`\t`) or multiple spaces for indentation.

### Bug Location:
The bug is primarily located in the `elif char == ' '` and `elif char == '\t'` blocks where the function increments the `current_column` for spaces and tabs. The incorrect incrementing of the `current_column` results in misleading column positions.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the function to incorrectly identify the column position based on spaces and tabs within the `prefix` string. This leads to misalignment between the expected and actual column positions, resulting in the failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the `current_column` calculation for both spaces and tabs to correctly account for the indentation level. Additionally, we should review the logic related to switching `wait_for_nl` to accurately capture the next line boundary.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Adjusting for tab indentation
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By modifying the calculation for tab characters to increment by 4 spaces, we can ensure that the function correctly handles indentation levels using both spaces and tabs. This correction should resolve the failing tests related to indentation issues.
