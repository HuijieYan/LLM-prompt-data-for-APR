### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the logic related to handling indentation levels in the input string. The function is designed to consume characters until a newline character is encountered, while also considering the column where indentation ends. However, the current implementation fails to correctly identify and handle the indentation level in some cases, leading to incorrect slicing of the input string.

Specifically, the bug occurs when the function encounters a non-whitespace character after reaching the expected column for indentation. It fails to correctly wait for a newline character before continuing to construct the output string and store the consumed lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to adjust the logic to correctly handle indentation levels and ensure that the function processes each character in the input string according to the intended behavior. We should focus on properly identifying the end of indentation and waiting for a newline character before proceeding to construct the output.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, we have added an additional condition under `elif char == '\n'` to properly handle cases where the current column is less than the expected indentation column. This modification ensures that the function correctly waits for a newline character before proceeding with constructing the output string and storing consumed lines.
