### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs because the logic for handling waiting for a new line is incorrect. The function incorrectly handles the case when encountering a new line character `\n` while waiting for a new line. It should reset `current_line` and `current_column` values, but instead, it continues to accumulate characters in `current_line`. This leads to the incorrect behavior of keeping the `current_line` containing the comment instead of starting a new line.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to correct the handling of the new line character `\n` when `wait_for_nl` is set to `True`. When encountering a new line character, we should reset the `current_line` and `current_column` values correctly to start a new line. This adjustment will ensure that the function correctly consumes the prefix based on the specified column value.

### Corrected Version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # reached a new line
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

This corrected version addresses the issue by resetting `current_line` and `current_column` when encountering a new line character and waiting for a new line to start. This fix ensures the function behaves correctly when consuming the prefix based on the provided column value.
