### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is incorrectly handling the case when encountering a newline character (`\n`). The function is not properly resetting the `current_line` and `current_column` variables when reaching a newline character. This causes the function to keep track of incorrect line and column positions as it continues processing the prefix string.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the function to correctly handle newline characters and reset the line and column positions when encountering them.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By modifying the code to properly handle newline characters by resetting the `current_line` and `current_column` variables when encountering them, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases.
