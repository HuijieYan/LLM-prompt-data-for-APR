### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has a problem handling the indentation when a comment follows a dedent with tabs. The function incorrectly updates the column count, leading to improper comment indentation.

In the failing test scenario, when encountering a tab character before the comment, the function incorrectly increases the `current_column` by 4 instead of staying at 0 (the starting point of a new line). This incorrect behavior results in the comment being improperly aligned after a dedent, causing the assertion to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for updating the `current_column` when encountering tabs in the prefix. Tabs should reset the column count to 0, not increase it by 4. This correction will ensure correct handling of tab indentation and prevent the comment misalignment issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = 0  # Fix: Reset column count to 0 for tabs
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By resetting the `current_column` to 0 when encountering a tab character, the corrected function should now handle tab indentation properly, aligning comments correctly after a dedent. This fix addresses the reported issue on GitHub as well.
