### Bug Explanation:

The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs due to the incorrect handling of white spaces, tabs, and newlines when tracking the indentation level. Specifically, the logic to handle whitespaces and tabs to update the `current_column` is flawed, leading to incorrect behavior when processing the prefix.

In the failing test `test_comment_indentation`, the issue is observed when a comment is encountered after an indent. The function fails to maintain the correct relative indentation between the comment and subsequent lines, causing the assertion to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately track the column where the non-whitespace content starts after an indent and correctly adjust for comments. The logic for handling whitespaces, tabs, newlines, and comments within the function needs to be revised to properly maintain the correct formatting. Moreover, ensuring that the comments are aligned correctly with the rest of the code is essential.

### Corrected Function:

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # Check if it is a comment and adjust indentation
            if current_line.strip().startswith('#'):
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the indentation of comments and maintain the expected formatting when processing the prefix input.
