## Bug Analysis
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is called when processing indentation in the context of comments in the provided test cases.
2. The bug seems to be related to handling tab characters specifically when comments are involved.
3. It fails to handle the correct indentation level for comments after dedent operations, leading to incorrect formatting.
4. The function incorrectly processes the indentation logic when encountering tab characters.
5. The failing test demonstrates the issue by comparing the actual output with the expected output, highlighting the incorrect handling of comment indentation after dedent.
6. The function should correctly identify the column position for each character, considering spaces and tabs correctly.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that every character, including spaces and tabs, contributes to the correct column count.
2. Adjust the logic for handling tab characters to align with the expected behavior for Python code.
3. Refactor the function to accurately track the column position and detect changes in indentation levels, especially after dedents.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 8 + 1) * 8  # Adjust based on tab width
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

In this corrected version:
- The handling of tabs has been adjusted to increment the column position by the appropriate width based on Python's tab width convention (usually 8 spaces).
- The logic for updating the current column and detecting line breaks has been improved to ensure accurate tracking of the line structure.

This corrected function should now properly handle the indentation logic for comments and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
