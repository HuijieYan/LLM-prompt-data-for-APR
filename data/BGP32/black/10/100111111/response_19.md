The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a given prefix based on a specific column. The issue seems to arise when processing comments and the indentation level. The function doesn't handle the case where there are tab characters involved in the input prefix.

The problematic part is when the function encounters a tab character (`\t`). It correctly increments `current_column` by 4, as tabs are assumed to represent 4 spaces. However, during the processing of the `char == '\n'` condition, the function fails to account for the correct column alignment when a tab character is present.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the column calculation takes tabs into consideration correctly. Each tab character should be treated as 4 spaces for indentation calculation purposes.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            step = 4 - (current_column % 4)  # Calculate the spaces remaining to make the column a multiple of 4
            current_column += step
            current_line += ' ' * step
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 3  # Increment by 3 instead of 1 for proper alignment when space is encountered
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that tab characters are correctly handled for column alignment. The function now processes tabs as 4 spaces each for indentation calculation. With this correction, the function should now behave as expected and pass the failing test cases provided.
