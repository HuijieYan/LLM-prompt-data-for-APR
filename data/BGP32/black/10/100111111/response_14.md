## Bug Explanation

The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix()` is designed to partially consume a prefix string, keeping track of indentation columns based on tab and space characters. The bug occurs when the function encounters a newline character `'\n'`. It resets the current column counter to 0, assuming the newline is at the start of a new line. However, in the case of comments like `# comment`, the comment should start at the current indentation level, not at column 0 after a newline.

For instance, in Case 1, the function incorrectly resets the `current_column` to 0 when encountering `'\n'`, resulting in the comment losing its indentation level relative to the previous line.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic when processing the newline character `'\n'` within the prefix string. Instead of resetting `current_column` to 0, the function should update it based on the current indentation level to maintain the correct relative indentation for comments. We need to ensure that the comment starts at the correct indentation level based on the preceding code.

## Corrected Version of the Function

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix()` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = column  # Update current_column to maintain correct relative indentation
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Update current_column based on current indentation level
            current_column = 0 if not current_line.strip() else column
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the `current_column` correctly when encountering `'\n'`, the corrected function ensures that comments maintain their relative indentation based on the preceding code lines. This fix addresses the issue of incorrect comment indentation after dedents when dealing with tabulated code.
