### Explanation:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a given prefix based on indentation levels. However, it fails to handle the case where a comment follows an indented block. The issue arises due to the incorrect handling of newlines and column tracking after indentation.

In the failing test case `test_comment_indentation`, the function could not correctly consume the prefixes, resulting in a mismatch in the expected and actual formatted output due to incorrect handling of comments.

The identified potential error locations include:
1. Handling of newlines when moving to a new line.
2. Incorrect tracking of the current column while iterating through the prefix.
3. Inadequate handling of spaces and tabs for indentation levels.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly consumes the prefix according to the indentation levels before a comment. This involves correctly updating the current column, tracking newlines, and handling tab and space characters for proper indentation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        if char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the handling of tab, space, and newline characters, along with tracking the current column correctly, the corrected function should now process the prefixes accurately based on the given indentation levels. This modification should resolve the failing test case and align with the expected input/output values.
