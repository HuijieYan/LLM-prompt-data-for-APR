## Correction:

After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test, it is evident that the issue lies in the indentation calculation logic. When encountering whitespace characters while building the current line, the `current_column` should be updated accordingly to maintain correct indentation. Additionally, once an indent is finished (`elif char != ' ' and char != '\t' and char != '\n'`), it should check if a new line is needed based on the current column count.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the `current_column` is updated correctly as whitespace characters are encountered, and the logic to handle the end of an indent and current column count is adjusted to align with the expected behavior. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and operate as intended based on the expected input/output values and the details provided in the GitHub issue.
