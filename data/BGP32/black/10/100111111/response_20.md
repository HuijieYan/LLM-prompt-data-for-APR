Based on the analysis, the bug appears to be related to how the function `_partially_consume_prefix` handles indentation when encountering comments. The issue arises when a comment is preceded by whitespace characters (spaces, tabs) and the function incorrectly sets the `wait_for_nl` flag, which leads to incorrect indentation handling.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic inside the function `_partially_consume_prefix` to correctly handle the indentation based on the presence of comments. We can achieve this by modifying the conditions for updating `wait_for_nl` and the handling of spaces and tabs.

Here is a corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            current_line += char
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_line += char
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_line += char
                wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This correction should address the issue with incorrect comment indentation after a dedent. Additionally, it should resolve the failing test cases provided. Now, when comments are encountered, the function will correctly handle the indentation based on the preceding whitespace characters.

After implementing this correction, please run the failing test cases again to ensure that the bug is fixed and the expected input/output values are met.
