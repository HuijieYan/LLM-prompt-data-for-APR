Based on the analysis provided, the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in how it handles the wait_for_nl flag and the indentation for the comments. The function fails to correctly maintain the indentation of the comments, especially when a code block is followed by a comment with tabs.

To fix this bug, the function needs to ensure that the comment lines maintain the same level of indentation as the code blocks. One way to achieve this is by adjusting the logic in the function to correctly handle the indentation levels during comment processing.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # reset to zero when a new line is encountered
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished for the code block
            wait_for_nl = True
    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
        res = ''.join(lines)
        return res, prefix[len(res):]

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This correction ensures that when a comment line follows a code block, it maintains the correct indentation level. This updated function should now pass the failing test cases provided and address the issue reported on GitHub related to incorrect comment indentation after a dedent.
