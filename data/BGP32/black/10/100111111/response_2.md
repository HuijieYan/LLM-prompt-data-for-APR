## Bug Explanation

### Issue:
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is incorrectly handling the indentation of comments after a dedent. This results in incorrect behavior for tabulated comments in the test cases provided, causing the tests to fail.

### Analysis:
1. The function processes the input prefix character by character, tracking the current line, current column, and whether it should wait for a new line.
2. The issue arises when the function encounters a newline character ('\n'). At this point, it resets the current column to 0, which is incorrect behavior for maintaining the correct indentation of comments.
3. The function fails to consider the scenarios where comments should maintain the same level of indentation after a dedent.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function needs to handle newline characters differently so that comments retain their correct indentation levels. This would involve ensuring that the current column value is updated correctly based on the scenario.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column = 0  # Adjust the logic to handle indent after new line for comments
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the logic to handle newline characters for comments correctly as indicated above, the corrected function should now maintain the indentation of comments as expected in the test cases.
