## Bug Fix Explanation

The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the handling of the `wait_for_nl` condition. When a non-whitespace character is encountered, the function sets `wait_for_nl` to True, indicating that it is expecting a newline character to determine if the current line is correctly indented or not. However, under certain conditions, such as when encountering a newline character after whitespace characters, the function incorrectly sets `wait_for_nl` to False, which disrupts the expected indentation of the lines.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `wait_for_nl` is properly set to True only when it should be waiting for a newline character to determine the indentation level. We should update the logic within the function to handle the `wait_for_nl` condition accurately.

## Bug Fix Strategy

1. Adjust the conditions for setting `wait_for_nl` to True or False to correctly track when to wait for a newline to determine line indentation.
2. Update the indentation level calculation based on the `column` parameter and the encountered characters to maintain the intended format and alignment of the lines.

## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # reset current_column when encountering a newline
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True if char.isspace() else False

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic for setting `wait_for_nl` and adjusting the indentation calculation based on encountered characters, the corrected version of the function should now handle the indentation correctly as expected in the failing test cases and resolve the reported issue on GitHub.
