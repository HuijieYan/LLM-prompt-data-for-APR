### Explanation of the Bug
The bug occurs in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function due to incorrect handling of indents and new lines when processing the prefix input. The function loses track of the correct column position when encountering a newline character and does not handle tab characters properly.

In the failing test scenario of `test_comment_indentation`, the expected output is determined based on the indentation level and the presence of comments in the input. The function fails to properly handle the indentation and reformatting of comments, leading to mismatched results compared to the expected output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly manages the column position with respect to spaces, tabs, and new lines. Properly handling these cases will allow the function to correctly track the indentation level and preserve comments' positions relative to the code blocks.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_column = 0
                current_line = ""
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version of the function ensures that the correct column position is maintained by handling spaces, tabs, and new lines appropriately. This correction addresses the bug where the comment indentation was incorrectly changed after a dedent, as reported in the GitHub issue.
