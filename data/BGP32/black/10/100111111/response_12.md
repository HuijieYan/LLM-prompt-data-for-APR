## Bug Fix Strategy

The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function stems from the incorrect handling of indentation and newline characters, especially in scenarios involving tabs and comment lines. To fix this issue, we need to adjust how the current line, column tracking, and newline handling are managed within the function.

1. Update the condition for resetting the column and lines when encountering a newline character to handle tab characters correctly.
2. Ensure that the comment lines retain the correct indentation level after a dedent, as expected in the failing test case.
3. Properly manage the current column count when encountering tab characters.
4. Refactor the logic to handle different indentation types consistently.

By addressing these issues, the function should be able to correctly consume the prefix while maintaining indentation and handling comment lines as expected.

## Corrected Function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            # Check if it is a comment line
            if current_line.lstrip().startswith("#"):
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_column = 0
                current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
    
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, current_line
```

This corrected version aims to address the issues related to incorrect indentation handling for comments after a dedent. By ensuring that comment lines are preserved correctly and indentations are updated accordingly, the function should produce the expected output for the failing test cases.
