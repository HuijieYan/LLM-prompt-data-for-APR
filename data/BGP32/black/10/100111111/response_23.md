## Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs when there is a non-empty line with a column less than the specified `column` value, but the subsequent comment retains the indentation of the previous line instead of following the indentation rules. This results in the incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent.

The bug can be pinpointed to the handling of `wait_for_nl` where comments are not appropriately aligned after a dedent, leading to incorrect indentation of comments.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when a non-empty line with a column less than the specified `column` value is encountered, subsequent comments should be correctly aligned with the following lines according to the specified `column`. Therefore, we need to adjust the logic related to `wait_for_nl` and comment indentation.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

Now, with the adjusted logic to handle comment indentation after a dedent properly, this corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases and resolve the GitHub issue related to incorrect comment indentation after a dedent.
