### Analyzing the Buggy Function and Failing Test

The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to process a prefix string and adjust indentation based on the provided column value. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is testing the behavior of the function when dealing with comments and indentation transformations.

### Error Identification

1. In the failing test, an assertion error occurs when comparing the expected output with the actual output. The comparison fails due to a discrepancy in comment indentation after a dedent.
2. In the function `_partially_consume_prefix`, the issue appears to be related to management of indentation levels, especially when transitioning from indentation to comments.

### Bug Cause

The cause of the bug arises from the function `_partially_consume_prefix` incorrectly handling the scenario when a comment is encountered after an indent change. This results in the comment being adjusted incorrectly, leading to a failing test and an assertion error.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to properly handle comment indentation after dedents. This can be achieved by ensuring that comments retain the correct indentation level even after a dedent operation.

### Corrected Version of the Function

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            if wait_for_nl:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should handle comment indentation after dedents correctly, resolving the failing test case and addressing the GitHub issue related to incorrect comment indentation in tab-indented code.
