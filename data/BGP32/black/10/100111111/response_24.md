### Bug Explanation:

The bug occurs in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function due to the incorrect handling of indentation when a comment is encountered. The function incorrectly assumes that the comment indentation should be reset to the first non-whitespace character column after encountering a newline, even if the comment is intended to be aligned with the previous indentation level.

This incorrect behavior leads to the failing tests, as the comment indentation is not maintained as expected after dedenting.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic when processing newlines and comments. Instead of resetting the column to 0 after every newline, we should preserve the indentation level for comments if they are at the expected column position. Only reset the column count when encountering a newline that indicates a new line of code.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic for newline characters in this corrected version of the function, the comment indentation preservation issue should be resolved, and the failing tests should pass as expected.
