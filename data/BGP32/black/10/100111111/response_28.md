### Bug Explanation:
The issue lies in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function where the condition to adjust the column for indentation is incorrect when encountering a tab character. It increments the `current_column` by 4 for each tab character, regardless of the actual tab width used in the input.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Identify the actual tab width being used in the input.
2. Modify the function to adjust `current_column` according to the identified tab width.
3. Update the function to handle tab characters correctly to align the comment indentation properly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            tab_width = 4  # Assuming a tab width of 4 spaces, adjust if needed
            adjustment = tab_width - (current_column % tab_width)
            current_column += adjustment
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After implementing the corrected function, the indentation for comments following dedents should align correctly with the surrounding code, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub post.
