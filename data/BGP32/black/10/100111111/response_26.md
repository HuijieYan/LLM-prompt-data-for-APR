Looking at the buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix`, there seems to be a logic error in handling the indentation levels when encountering comments. The function is designed to partially consume the prefix based on the provided column value. However, the issue arises when a comment is encountered after an indent change.

The issue can be observed in the failing test `test_comment_indentation`, where the comment indentation is not preserved correctly. This is due to the logic error in the function. When encountering a non-empty comment while waiting for a new line (`wait_for_nl == True`), the function fails to properly handle the comment's indentation level, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we should adjust the logic of the function to correctly handle the indentation levels in the presence of comments. Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, I modified the logic to properly handle comments in the function. Now, the function should be able to correctly preserve the comment indentation after dedent operations.
