### Analysis
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function in the `driver.py` file has a bug related to preserving indentation levels for comments after a dedent operation. The function fails to handle correct indentation when there are comments at a specific depth. The failing test case `test_comment_indentation` highlights this issue, where the reformatting operation does not maintain correct indentation for comments after a dedent.

### Bug Explanation
1. The `wait_for_nl` flag is incorrectly set and causes issues during the handling of tabs and spaces.
2. The logic related to processing tabs and spaces within the indentation level is flawed, leading to incorrect column calculations.
3. The function fails to handle the scenario where the comment needs to maintain the same indentation level as the following line after indenting.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, these steps can be followed:
1. Adjust the logic for updating the `current_column` based on tabs and spaces.
2. Make sure comments are correctly aligned according to the previous line's indentation level.
3. Properly handle the scenario where a comment follows a dedent operation.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Adjust the column calculation based on tabs
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

Applying the suggested fixes to the function should resolve the bug related to incorrect comment indentation after a dedent operation. The corrected function should align comments as expected and pass the failing test scenario.
