After analyzing the code, the issue seems to arise due to the incorrect handling of the waiting state for a newline character in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. The function prematurely returns the lines without considering the indentation level of the comments. This causes the actual output to differ from the expected output, resulting in failed tests.

To fix this issue:
1. Ensure that the `wait_for_nl` flag is reset to `False` only when encountering a newline character after consuming the required number of spaces or tabs for indentation.
2. Keep track of the column count for each line to correctly calculate the remaining spaces needed for indentation.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    remaining_spaces = column - current_column
                    res = ''.join(lines) + " " * remaining_spaces
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the corrections made above, the function should now handle the indentation of comments correctly after a dedent operation. This updated version should pass the failing tests and resolve the issue raised in the GitHub report.
