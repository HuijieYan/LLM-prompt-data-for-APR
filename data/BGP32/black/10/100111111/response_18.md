## Bug Explanation:

The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs when the function encounters tabs in the input prefix and tries to calculate indentation levels based on tabs. Due to a miscalculation in handling tabs, the function fails to maintain correct indentation levels for comments. This issue leads to incorrect reformatting of the code for tab-based indentation.

### Root Cause of the Bug:
- The `current_column` calculation within the function does not correctly handle tabs, leading to an incorrect indentation level.
- When encountering a tab character (`\t`), the function increments `current_column` by 4, assuming each tab represents 4 spaces. However, this causes inaccuracies in determining the actual indentation level and results in the incorrect handling of comments.

## Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix the bug:
- Adjust the calculation of the `current_column` when encountering tabs to accurately reflect the indentation level.
- Update the logic related to tabs in the function to ensure proper handling of indentation levels for tab characters.
- Validate the behavior of the function after modifying the tab handling to ensure correct formatting of comments in tab-based indentation scenarios.

## Corrected Function:

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            tab_spaces = 4 - (current_column % 4)  # Calculate spaces needed to align
            current_column += tab_spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating how tab characters are handled and adjusting the calculation for `current_column` when encountering tabs, this corrected function should now properly handle indentation levels and maintain the correct formatting for comments in tab-indented code.

Feel free to integrate this corrected function into your code to resolve the bug related to incorrect comment indentation in tab-based scenarios.
