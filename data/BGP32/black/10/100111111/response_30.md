### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming the prefix until a certain column and returning the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix. The bug occurs when there is a comment following an indented block, where the comment's indentation is modified incorrectly. The function fails to handle the correct indentation when a comment is preceded by multiple levels of indentation.

### Bug Explanation
- In the failing test case, the function fails to preserve the correct indentation of the comments that follow an indented block after dedent operations.
- The bug lies in the `elif char == '\n':` condition where it resets the `current_column` to `0` but does not handle correctly indentations following successive dedents.
- This causes the comment to be misplaced as the function wrongly expects the next line to realign with the beginning of the current line instead of preserving the indentation level.

### Fix Strategy
To address the bug:
- Modify the logic to preserve the correct indentation levels of comments following multiple indented blocks.
- Adjust the condition handling to correctly maintain the indentation during dedents and show the comment at the expected indentation level.
- Update the logic to handle the case of the comment's indentation based on the column parameter provided.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making these modifications, the corrected function should now preserve the correct comment indentation after a dedent, solving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
