## Bug Explanation

The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to consume characters from a string until a specific indentation level is reached based on the provided `column` parameter. The bug occurs when handling `\n` characters. Instead of correctly indenting the comment line to match the indentation of subsequent lines, the function resets the indentation level for `\n` characters, leading to incorrect indentation.

The failing test `test_comment_indentation` highlights the issue when trying to format code with comments using tabs. The error message shows that the actual output differs from the expected output due to incorrect handling of comment line indentation.

Analyzing the runtime values and the expected values for different cases, it's evident that the function fails to maintain the correct indentation level when encountering newlines.

## Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, the function needs to maintain the indentation level for comments appropriately. This involves correctly adjusting the indentation for comment lines based on the provided `column` parameter.

1. When encountering a `\n` character, ensure that the current line's indentation level is maintained for upcoming comment lines.
2. Update the logic for handling indentation levels after dedents to correctly align comment lines with the surrounding code.
3. Verify that the function maintains correct indentation behavior for both space and tab characters, especially for comment lines.

## Corrected Version

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                # Adjust comment lines indentation to match column
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Maintain the indentation level for comment lines
            if "#" in current_line:  
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                current_column = 0
        else:
            # Adjust indentation for non-indentation characters
            wait_for_nl = False

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to handle newline characters and comments correctly, the corrected version ensures the correct indentation alignment for comment lines based on the provided `column` parameter. This update should resolve the bug and allow the function to pass the failing test cases.
