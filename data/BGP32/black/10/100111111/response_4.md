## Bug Explanation

The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` fails to correctly handle indentation levels when there is a mixture of spaces and tabs, impacting comments' indentation after a dedent. The function fails to consider the combination of spaces and tabs when updating the indentation level for the comments.

In the failing test `test_comment_indentation`, the error message indicates that the comment indentation is incorrect after a dedent, specifically in the comparison between the actual and expected values. This discrepancy stems from the function not properly handling mixed tabs and spaces scenarios.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix this bug and address the failing tests related to comment indentation after dedent with a mix of tabs and spaces, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function needs to ensure correct handling of indentation levels with tabs and spaces. Specifically, the function should track each indentation type and adjust the indentation level accordingly to maintain consistency when dedenting in the presence of mixed tabs and spaces.

## Corrected Version

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    mixed_tab_count = 0

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                mixed_tab_count = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Adjust for mixed tabs and spaces indentation levels
            mixed_tab_count += 1
            current_column += 1 + (mixed_tab_count - 1) // 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            mixed_tab_count = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By introducing the `mixed_tab_count` variable and adjusting the calculation for tab indentation, the corrected version of the function should now correctly handle instances of mixed tabs and spaces, ensuring proper comment indentation after dedenting in scenarios like the failing test `test_comment_indentation`.
