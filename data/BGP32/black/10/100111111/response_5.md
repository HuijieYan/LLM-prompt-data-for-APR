### Analysis:
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to handle indentation issues and consume parts of a given prefix until a specific column is reached. The bug occurs when handling tabs and spaces indentation, resulting in incorrect behavior when encountering comments after a dedent.

1. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` compares the formatted output of blacking code containing tabs and spaces. The test fails when checking the indentation of comments after a dedent.
   
2. The function's logic has a bug that causes incorrect handling of indentation after dedents, specifically with tabs.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the incorrect tracking of the current column when consuming prefixes with tabs and spaces intermixed, leading to incorrect handling of comments.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when processing tabs and spaces for indentation, the column count is correctly updated and aligned with the expected behavior of indentation after dedents.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating how the `current_column` is adjusted when encountering tabs, we ensure correct indentation handling, resolving the issue with comments after dedents as reported in the failing test and GitHub issue.
