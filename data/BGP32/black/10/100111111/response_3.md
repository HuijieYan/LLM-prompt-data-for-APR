## Bug Explanation

The bug occurs in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function where the logic to handle indentation and waiting for a new line (`wait_for_nl`) is causing incorrect behavior when a comment line starts after a dedent. When encountering a tab character (`'\t'`), the `current_column` is incremented by 4, which does not align with the expected behavior of handling tabs in Python source files.

The incorrect handling of tab characters is leading to differences in the resulting output between the fixes made in the code and the expected output, causing the failing test cases.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, the handling of tab characters (`'\t'`) needs to be adjusted to correctly calculate the `current_column` based on the current indentation level. Additionally, the condition for correctly appending lines needs to be adjusted to handle comments after a dedent appropriately.

## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            increment = 4 - current_column % 4
            current_column += increment
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
        
        current_line += char
        
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the handling of tab characters and the condition for appending lines, this corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now pass the failing test cases and align with the expected output values.
