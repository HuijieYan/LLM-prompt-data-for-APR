### Bug Fix Strategy:
The bug seems to be caused by incorrect handling of indentation levels for comments after dedenting. It appears that the function `_partially_consume_prefix` does not accurately track the column numbers when encountering tabs or newlines. To fix this issue:
1. Ensure that the `current_column` is correctly updated based on different characters encountered.
2. Make sure that the `current_column` is reset when encountering a newline to handle the indentation correctly.
3. Adjust the logic for tracking the column number accurately when encountering tabs or spaces.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the function as above, it should correctly handle the indentation levels for comments after dedenting and align with the expected input/output values. This should resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report and ensure that the failing test cases pass successfully.
