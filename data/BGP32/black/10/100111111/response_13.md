Based on the analysis of the buggy function and failing test, we can see that the issue lies in how the function `_partially_consume_prefix` handles the indentation of comments after a dedent. The function does not correctly handle the indentation in cases where comments are involved. More specifically, the function fails to adjust the column count after encountering a comment. 

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic of `_partially_consume_prefix` to properly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent. Specifically, we need to adjust the `column` count when a comment is found in the input prefix.

Here is a corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':
            # handling comment indentation
            while prefix.startswith(' ', current_column) or prefix.startswith('\t', current_column):
                current_column += 1 if prefix.startswith(' ', current_column) else 4
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This updated function now includes a section to handle comment indentation by skipping over spaces or tabs associated with the comment in the prefix. By adjusting the `column` count accordingly, the function should now correctly preserve the correct indentation for comments after a dedent.

After applying this fix to the buggy function, the failing test should now pass as intended.
