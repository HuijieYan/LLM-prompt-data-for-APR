## Fixing the Bug

### Error Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not correctly handling the indentation level when encountering comments after a dedent. This results in incorrect indentation for tabulated comments in the output.
2. The `wait_for_nl` flag is not properly reset in all cases which leads to incorrect handling of characters after a dedent.
3. The function fails to maintain the correct indentation level for comments in the presence of tabs.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to inconsistent handling of different characters and not resetting the flag `wait_for_nl` appropriately, leading to incorrect identification of the end of indentation.

### Strategy for Bug Fixing:
1. Ensure that the `wait_for_nl` flag is reset properly for each character in the prefix string.
2. Adjust the logic to correctly track the column and identify the end of indentation before a comment is encountered.
3. Maintain consistent handling of different characters including spaces, tabs, and newline characters.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # reset current_column after encountering a newline
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            if char == '#':
                # adjust the current line indentation for comments
                if current_column < column:
                    while current_column < column:
                        current_line += ' '
                        current_column += 1
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the function as shown above, we address the improper handling of comments after a dedent. The corrected function now correctly maintains indentation levels and provides the expected output, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
