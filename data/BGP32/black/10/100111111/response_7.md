To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to update the logic handling the indentation check before the comment in the `wait_for_nl` block.

The issue arises because the function incorrectly evaluates the indentation before the comment in the case where a comment is followed by a newline. This causes the indentation to shift improperly, leading to failing test cases.

To resolve this, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation check before the comment when a newline character is encountered. In particular, we need to revise the indentation logic for this specific case to accurately maintain the correct levels of indentation before the comment.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                continue  # Skip the remaining logic inside this block
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version includes the necessary adjustment to the indentation check when encountering a newline character after a comment. Now, the function should pass the failing test cases and align with the expected input/output values.
