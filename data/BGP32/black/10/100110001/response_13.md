### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is expected to partially consume a prefix based on certain conditions, such as indentation levels. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is comparing the result of applying this function to two different strings with different indentation levels and a comment. The error message indicates that the expected and actual output are not matching due to differences in indentation levels of the comments.

### Potential Error Location:
The bug might be related to how the function handles the whitespace characters, tabs, and newline characters which determine the indentation levels.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs when a comment is encountered, and the function is not correctly adjusting the indentation levels based on the presence of the comment and newline characters. This leads to incorrect output and the failing test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation levels when a comment is present in the input string. Indentation should be maintained consistent with the original input.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By including the handling of newline characters in a way that maintains proper indentation levels, the corrected function should now pass the failing test.
