## Analysis:
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to partially consume a given prefix based on the specified column position. The bug in this function causes incorrect handling of whitespace characters like tabs and spaces when determining the indentation levels.

## Identified Issue:
The issue lies in the section where the function checks for tabs and spaces to calculate the current column. When encountering a tab character '\t', the current_column is incremented by 4 instead of just 1. This discrepancy in calculation causes incorrect alignment and leads to the failing test scenarios.

## Bug Cause:
1. The function improperly increments the `current_column` by 4 when encountering a tab character '\t', leading to an incorrect calculation of the current column position.
2. This incorrect column position causes the function to misinterpret the indentation level, resulting in the mismatch between the expected and actual output in the failing test.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
Update the logic for handling tab characters '\t' to increment the `current_column` by 1 instead of 4. This adjustment will align the column calculation with the desired indentation level based on tabs and spaces.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 1  # Corrected: increment by 1 for tab
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After making the adjustment in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function as mentioned above, the function should now correctly handle the indentation levels and align the output with the expected results in the failing test. This corrected version resolves the bug in indentation handling caused by incorrect tab character calculations.
