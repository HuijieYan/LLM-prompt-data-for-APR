### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for consuming a prefix of characters until a certain column is reached, handling indentation and new lines accordingly.
- The failing test `test_comment_indentation` compares the formatting of code snippets with different levels of indentation, focusing on how comments are handled.
- The error message shows that the test fails when comparing two code snippets due to incorrect handling of comments and indentation in the provided function.

### Issue:
The bug occurs when the function encounters a comment line after consuming the prefix up to a certain column. It fails to correctly handle the indentation of the comment line, leading to a discrepancy between the expected and actual outputs.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, ensure that when a comment line is reached, the indentation of the comment is adjusted based on the previously consumed context, including the column information.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
        res = ''.join(lines)
        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the logic to correctly handle indentation before and after encountering a comment line, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
