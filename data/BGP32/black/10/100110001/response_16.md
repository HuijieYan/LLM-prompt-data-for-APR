### Analysis:
1. The `test_comment_indentation` test is comparing two different indentations of the same code block with comments. It expects the function `fs` to format the content correctly.
2. The error message indicates that the indentation is not being handled correctly with comments in the `contents_tab`.

### Bug:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to how it handles the indentation of lines with comments. It fails to consider the indentation level while processing the content.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles the indentation levels while consuming the prefix content. Specifically, we need to adjust the way the `wait_for_nl` variable is used to track the end of an indentation level.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ' or char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 if char == '\t' else 1
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying the corrections, the function should now properly handle the indentation levels and correctly process the prefix content, allowing the `test_comment_indentation` test to pass.
