### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume characters from a string until a certain column is reached.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` compares two strings with different indentation formats.
3. The error message indicates that the output of the function is not as expected, causing a misalignment in indentation levels.
4. The bug is likely in the logic related to handling newline characters and column counts. The function may not be correctly tracking the current column number and handling newlines in a way that causes the indentation to shift.
5. Strategy for fixing the bug:
   - Ensure that the function correctly handles newline characters and updates the current column number accordingly.
   - Verify that the function correctly identifies when to stop consuming characters based on the specified column.
   - Adjust the logic to maintain the correct indentation level when consuming characters.
   
### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the logic of handling newlines and column counts has been adjusted to ensure that the function correctly consumes characters up to the specified column while maintaining the correct indentation level.
