## Analysis:
1. The `assertFormatEqual` method is failing in the test `test_comment_indentation`.
2. The error indicates a mismatch in the expected and actual formatted contents, specifically in the positioning of the comment indentation.
3. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for handling the partial consumption of prefixes in the driver code for black formatting.
4. The bug seems to occur due to incorrect handling of indentation levels and spaces during prefix consumption.

## Bug Cause:
The bug seems to be caused when there is an unexpected empty line in the input prefix. The logic to handle the indentation levels and spaces is not consistent in these cases, leading to incorrect formatting.

## Fix Strategy:
1. We need to ensure that the logic for handling indentation levels and spaces is correct and consistent, especially when encountering unexpected empty lines.
2. The function should accurately track the current column position and handle tab and space characters properly to maintain the correct indentation.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By incorporating the above changes, the corrected function should now handle indentation and formatting correctly, leading to the passing of the failing test.
