### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is used to consume a prefix string up to a certain column and return the consumed part and the remaining part of the prefix.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` compares the formatted string content for both tabs and spaces indentation styles.
3. The error occurs when comparing the formatted content for tabs and spaces, suggesting an issue with handling indentation levels in the buggy function.

### Bug:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function causes incorrect handling of indentation levels, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual formatted content in the failing test. The bug is related to the logic for handling tabs and spaces indentation in the function.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic inside the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle tabs and spaces indentation and ensure that the consumed prefix aligns with the specified column.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            current_line += ' ' * (4 - current_column % 4)
            current_column += 4
        elif char == ' ':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By correcting the logic to handle both tabs and spaces indentation properly, the corrected function should now pass the failing test without causing any assertion errors.
