### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming a string until a certain column limit is reached or a newline character is encountered.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` aims to compare two different indentation styles and ensure that the function correctly consumes the prefix up to a specified column limit.
3. The error message highlights a specific mismatch in indentation detection for comments in the two different styles, indicating that the function does not handle comments correctly.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the handling of comments. When encountering a `'#'`, the function incorrectly sets `wait_for_nl` flag to True, resulting in premature detection of line endings and incorrect consumption of the prefix.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic related to detecting comment lines within the function. The function should only wait for a newline if it has encountered whitespace or tabs and not when a `'#'` character is found.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = current_column >= column

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adding the `elif char == '#'` condition and setting `wait_for_nl` to True for comment detection, the corrected function should now handle comment lines correctly and pass the failing test.
