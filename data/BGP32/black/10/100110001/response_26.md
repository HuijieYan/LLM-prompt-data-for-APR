### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume part of a prefix string until a specific column, based on indentation and newline characters. The issue seems to be related to how the function handles the indentation of comments in the input text.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The code that identifies the start of a comment and waits for a newline character may not handle comment indentation correctly.
2. The logic related to handling newline characters and resetting the current column might not be functioning as intended.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the function not correctly handling the indentation of comments when parsing the input text. This results in unexpected differences between the expected and actual output, leading to the failing test and assertion error.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` needs to be updated to handle comment indentation properly. Specifically, the logic around identifying and handling comments, as well as newline characters, should be revised to ensure correct prefix extraction.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    in_comment = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        
        if in_comment:
            if char == '\n':
                in_comment = False
            continue
            
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':
            in_comment = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the function as shown above, it should correctly handle comment indentation and improve the overall prefix extraction process, resolving the bug and making the test pass.
