### Steps to Fix the Bug:

1. Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the failing test:
   - The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is related to the failing test `test_comment_indentation` in the test file `tests/test_black.py`.
   - The failing test compares the expected output with the actual output obtained by calling the buggy function.
   
2. Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function:
   - The bug seems to be related to how whitespace characters are handled within the `prefix` string.

3. Explaining the cause of the bug:
   - The bug causes the function to partially consume the `prefix` string incorrectly, leading to differences in indentation levels between the expected output and the actual output.
   - In the failing test, the comment indentation is not being handled correctly, resulting in mismatched expected and actual outputs.

4. Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug:
   - The function should correctly handle whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines) and ensure that the comment indentation is correctly preserved.

5. Corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            # Reset wait_for_nl to handle the next line
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # Reset current_column to handle new content
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By resetting `wait_for_nl` when encountering a newline character and resetting `current_column` when encountering a non-whitespace character, this corrected version should handle the comment indentation correctly.
