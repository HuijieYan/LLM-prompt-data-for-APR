## Analysis:
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is dealing with indentation and new lines in a given prefix. It seems that the function is not handling the indentation correctly, leading to an incorrect output.

## Bug Explanation:
The function is incorrectly processing the indentation in the `prefix`, which causes the incorrect output when comparing with the expected result in the failing test. This leads to the assertion error shown in the error message.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation and new lines in the prefix string.

## Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                continue
                
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            if current_column >= column:
                return ''.join(lines), current_line
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After fixing the function as shown above, it should now handle the indentation correctly and pass the failing test.
