### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for consuming a prefix string up to a specific column position.
2. The test function `test_comment_indentation` checks if the function correctly consumes the prefix string based on the column position.
3. The failing test comparison shows a mismatch when consuming prefixes with varying whitespace characters.
4. The buggy function fails to handle whitespace characters like tabs and spaces correctly, leading to an indentation mismatch.
5. It seems like the function is not correctly handling the case when a comment is encountered before reaching the target column position.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function fails to correctly handle the case when encountering a comment before reaching the target column position. This results in incorrect output due to miscounting of whitespace characters.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug:
1. Update the logic to handle cases where comments are encountered before reaching the target column.
2. Ensure that the whitespace (tabs and spaces) count is accurate.
3. Make adjustments to correctly identify when to stop consuming the prefix based on the target column position.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_column = 0
    current_line = ""
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying this fix, the function should now handle the case where a comment is encountered before reaching the target column position, providing the correct output.
