### Analysis:
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is responsible for handling the indentation levels in a given prefix string.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` passes some contents with tabs and spaces indentation and expects them to be formatted to spaces only. The error occurs when comparing the expected and actual formatted contents.
3. The error message indicates a mismatch between the formatted content when using tabs and when using spaces.
4. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles indentation levels with tabs and spaces, specifically in cases where there is a comment involved.
5. The current implementation of the function does not handle comment indentation correctly.

### Bug Explanation:
- The bug occurs when the function encounters a comment following an indented line. It fails to correctly handle the spacing or alignment of the comment relative to the preceding indented line, leading to a mismatch in the final output.
- The function does not account for the tab-to-space conversion required when a comment is present after an indented line.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to properly handle the scenario where a comment follows an indented line. Ensure that the correct spacing is maintained between the comment and the preceding indented line.
2. Implement logic to convert tabs to spaces when a comment is detected after an indented line.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':  # Handle comments
            # Convert tabs to spaces for consistent indentation
            spaces_to_add = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_line += ' ' * spaces_to_add
            current_column += spaces_to_add
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adding the condition to handle comments and convert tabs to spaces as needed, this corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now pass the failing test `test_comment_indentation`.
