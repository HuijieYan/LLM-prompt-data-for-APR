### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming the prefix based on the column provided. The function is designed to check for indentation levels using spaces, tabs, and newlines. However, the bug arises when a comment line is encountered.

### Bug Identification:
The bug occurs when the function encounters a comment line after consuming spaces or tabs. It fails to handle the comment line's indentation properly, leading to incorrect output.

### Bug Explanation:
The failing test `test_comment_indentation` provides two versions of code: one using tabs for indentation and the other using spaces. The function fails to handle the correct indentation when a comment line is present. This leads to a mismatch in the output, triggering the assertion error.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation for comment lines. Specifically, the function should handle the indentation level of comment lines in the same way as code lines.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ' or char == '\t' or char == '#':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function now properly handles the indentation for comment lines, ensuring that the output matches the expected indentation level for both code and comment lines. This should address the bug and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
