### Analysis:
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is responsible for consuming the prefix of the code indentation.
2. The error message is related to the incorrect handling of indentation and processing of tabs and spaces.
3. The failing test is due to the mismatch in expected output compared to the actual output. The function is not handling the indentation of comments correctly.
4. The bug is likely caused by the `wait_for_nl` condition which is not correctly identifying the end of the indentation block when encountering a comment.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that comments are taken into account when determining the end of the indentation block.

### Suggestions for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the logic inside the `for char in prefix:` loop to correctly handle comments as part of the indentation tracking.
2. Update the condition for `wait_for_nl` when encountering comments to correctly handle the end of the indentation block.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False  # Reset wait_for_nl on encountering newline
        elif char == '#':
            wait_for_nl = False  # Reset wait_for_nl on encountering comment
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By resetting the `wait_for_nl` flag when encountering a comment or a newline within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we ensure that the indentation block will be correctly identified even when comments are present.
