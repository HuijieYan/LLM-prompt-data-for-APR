### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string and identify the indentation level based on spaces and tabs. The issue arises when it encounters a comment within the code, as it fails to handle the indentation correctly.

The failing test `test_comment_indentation` checks whether the function handles the indentation correctly when a comment is present in the code. The error message indicates that the expected output does not match the actual output, specifically when encountering a comment line.

### Identified Issue:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function stems from how it handles comments. When a comment is encountered, it fails to correctly track the current indentation level and results in incorrect output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the function, we need to ensure that the indentation level is handled properly, even when comments are present. This can be achieved by adjusting the logic for tracking the current column and lines appropriately.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            current_line += char
            if char == '#':
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, the failing test `test_comment_indentation` should pass without any assertion errors.
