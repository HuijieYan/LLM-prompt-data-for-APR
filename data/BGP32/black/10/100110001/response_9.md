### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to extract a partial prefix until a specified column number is reached. The function skips indentation until it finds a new line character or a non-space character. The bug seems to be causing an issue with indentation handling.

### Potential Error:
The bug might be related to how the function is handling indentation and the end of the line.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be in the handling of indentation when encountering a comment later in the prefix. The function fails to properly identify the indentation level when it should end and this results in an incorrect extraction of the prefix.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Update the logic in the function to correctly handle the end of an indentation block even when encountering comments.
- Ensure that the function keeps track of the correct number of spaces and tabs for the specified column number.

### Corrected Version:
Here is a corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4   # adjust to 4 spaces for each tab
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should address the issue with incorrect prefix extraction for the given test case and should pass the failing test.
