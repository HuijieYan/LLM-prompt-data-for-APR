### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix up to a certain column in the provided text content.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is comparing two different formats of code content after passing it through the format string function `fs`.
3. The error message indicates an assertion error where the expected and actual outputs don't match due to a misplaced comment in the content.
   
### Bug in the Code:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function causes an issue where if a comment is present before the expected column, it is consumed along with the indentation, leading to incorrect output. This causes the failing test to not match the expected output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic in `_partially_consume_prefix` to handle cases where comments are encountered before reaching the expected column. We should ensure that comments are not consumed when they are not supposed to.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adding the condition `elif char == '#'`, we are now correctly handling comments in the code content. This modification ensures that comments are not consumed as part of the prefix if they are before the expected column. The corrected function should now pass the failing test.
