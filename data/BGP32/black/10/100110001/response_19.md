### Analysis:
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is responsible for partially consuming an indentation prefix in a given text. The buggy function fails to handle indentation correctly, causing the test case to fail when comparing tab and space indentation formats.

### Error:
The error occurs when comparing tab and space indentation formats in the `test_comment_indentation` test function. The function `assertFormatEqual` compares the expected and actual formatted strings, but due to incorrect handling of indentation in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, the comparison fails.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function stems from incorrect handling of indentation levels. It fails to update the `current_column` correctly for spaces and tabs, leading to incorrect extraction of the prefix in some cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `current_column` is updated correctly based on the type of character encountered (space, tab, newline). Additionally, we need to properly handle the behavior for processing and extracting the prefix of the text.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))  # Adjust for tab width
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This updated version properly handles the indentation levels for spaces, tabs, and newlines, ensuring correct consumption of the prefix. This implementation should now pass the failing test case.
