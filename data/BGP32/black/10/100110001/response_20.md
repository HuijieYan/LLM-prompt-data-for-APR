### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is used to consume a prefix string until a specific column is reached. The function processes characters in the prefix string and accumulates lines until the specified column is reached. However, the bug seems to be related to how the function handles indentation characters, spaces, and newlines.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The bug occurs when there is an unexpected empty line in the prefix string. The function resets the `current_column` to 0 when encountering a newline character, which leads to incorrect behavior.
2. When an unexpected empty line is encountered, the function does not process it correctly, resulting in an incorrect outcome for the prefix handling.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the function handles unexpected empty lines (newline characters). We should ensure that the function appropriately handles newlines and maintains proper column tracking.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip():
                # Process valid line
                lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the handling of newline characters and ensuring that valid lines are processed correctly, the corrected function should now handle the prefix string as intended.
