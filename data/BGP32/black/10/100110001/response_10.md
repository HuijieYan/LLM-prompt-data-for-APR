### Analysis:
The `test_comment_indentation` test case is failing due to a mismatch in handling comments. The issue seems to be related to the `_partially_consume_prefix` function not properly handling spaces and tabs before comments.

### Potential Error Location:
- The `wait_for_nl` condition logic can cause issues with indentation counting.
- The spacing logic for counting columns (`current_column`) might not be accurate.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the `_partially_consume_prefix` function miscounting the columns when there are spaces or tabs before comment lines. This leads to incorrect comparison results in the test case, resulting in a failure.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly counts the columns considering all types of whitespace characters (spaces, tabs) before comments. Adjust the logic for counting columns accurately and handling indentation properly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
    if current_line.strip():
        lines.append(current_line)
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making these adjustments to the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, it should now handle different kinds of whitespace characters before comments correctly. This should address the bug and allow the failing test case to pass.
