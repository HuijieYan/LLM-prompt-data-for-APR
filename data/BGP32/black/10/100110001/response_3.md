## Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is called within the codebase to handle prefix parsing.
- The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is comparing the behavior of `fs(contents_tab)` with `fs(contents_spc)`.
- The error message indicates a mismatch between the expected and actual output due to comment indentation.

## Bug:
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of indentations in comments within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. It fails to correctly adjust the column position when encountering comments with different levels of indentation.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_partially_consume_prefix` function correctly handles indentation while parsing the prefix. Specifically, the function should adjust the column position based on whitespace characters and track the correct indentation level when encountering comments.

## Updated Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            if current_line.strip().startswith('#'):
                wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now handle comment indentation correctly, ensuring that the column position is adjusted accordingly. This updated function should pass the failing test mentioned above.
