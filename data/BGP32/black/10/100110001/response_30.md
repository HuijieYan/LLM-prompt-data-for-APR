### Analysis:
1. The `assertFormatEqual` method in the test file expects the formatted content to be equal to the expected content.
2. The `test_comment_indentation` test case is failing because the `contents_tab` does not match the expected `contents_spc` due to an incorrect indentation format.
3. The error message shows that there is a discrepancy in the indentation of the comment after the `pass` statement in the `contents_tab`.
4. The bug seems to be related to the `_partially_consume_prefix` function not handling the tab characters correctly.

### Bug:
The bug occurs when the `_partially_consume_prefix` function encounters a tab character while processing the prefix string. The function incorrectly increments the `current_column` by 4 for each tab character encountered, which leads to incorrect column calculation and hence incorrect indentation comparison.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, adjust the column increment for tab characters to be consistent with the actual indentation change caused by a tab character.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Adjust the column increment for tab characters to match actual indentation
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making this correction in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, the bug should be fixed, and the corrected function should now pass the failing test case.
