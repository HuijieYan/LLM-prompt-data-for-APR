### Analysis:
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is used to handle indentation levels in Python code. The bug seems to be related to the way it processes indentation characters like tabs and spaces. 

### Identified Issue:
The issue lies in how the function handles the detection of newlines or indents. It is not correctly updating the `current_column` value and `lines` list if there are indentation characters like tabs or spaces.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug causes the function to not properly consume the prefix when encountering indentation levels in the input code. This leads to incorrect splitting of the prefix, resulting in the failing test and assertion error.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `current_column` and `lines` list are updated correctly when processing tabs, spaces, newlines, and indents. This will ensure the proper handling of prefixes with different indentation levels.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Updated to add 4 instead of 1 for tabs
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0  # Moved the resetting of column inside newline check
            continue  # Continue to next char without further processing
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the way tabs and newlines are handled, the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now properly consume the prefix and handle the indentation levels correctly.
