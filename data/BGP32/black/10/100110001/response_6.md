### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to process the indentation and formatting of Python code.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` tests the behavior of the function in handling comments and indentation.
3. The error occurs when the function fails to correctly consume prefix content, leading to a mismatch in the expected and actual output.
4. The error message indicates that the comment line in the test case is not correctly processed by the function, resulting in a formatting mismatch.

### Bug:
The bug is caused by the function not properly handling the scenario where a comment is encountered during the indentation parsing. This leads to incorrect line separation and, ultimately, a formatting mismatch.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when a comment is encountered, it is properly considered as part of the current line being processed. This requires adjusting the logic to handle comments within the indentation processing correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Process the comment as part of the current line
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    # Handle the case where input ends without a newline
    if current_line:
        lines.append(current_line)
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the logic to correctly handle comments as part of the current line during processing, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
