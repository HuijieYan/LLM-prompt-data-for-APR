### Analysis:
The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is used to consume characters from a prefix based on certain conditions. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is checking the behavior of this function when dealing with indentation in Python code. The error message indicates that the function is not handling the indentation properly.

### Error Location:
The bug is likely related to how the function handles the detection of new lines and indentation. The incorrect handling of indentation is causing the function to produce incorrect output.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the function not correctly handling the indentation and detecting the end of indentation. This leads to the incorrect slicing of the prefix, resulting in different outputs than expected.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly detects the end of the indentation and slices the prefix accordingly. This may involve modifying how the function determines when the indentation ends and how it handles various types of whitespace characters.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
After analyzing the bug, below is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column >= column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            res = ''.join(lines)
            return res, prefix[len(res):]

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Conclusion:
By correcting the logic of how the function handles indentation and when it detects the end of indentation, the bug should be fixed. The corrected function should now pass the failing test case provided.
