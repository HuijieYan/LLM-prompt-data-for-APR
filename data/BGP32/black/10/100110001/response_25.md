### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming a prefix of a given string based on column position.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` compares two versions of code with different indentation styles.
3. The error message indicates that the function failed to correctly adjust the prefix based on column position in the case of a comment line.

### Potential Error Location:
- The issue seems to be related to the handling of comment lines in the prefix consumption process.

### Cause of the Bug:
- When encountering a comment line in the prefix, the function is incorrectly consuming the prefix without considering the comment indentation. This results in an incorrect comparison between the expected and actual values in the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Adjust the logic in the function to correctly handle comment lines and ensure that the prefix consumption respects the column position for comments.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After making these changes, the function should now correctly handle the prefix consumption for comment lines and pass the failing test.
