### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for processing a given prefix of a string. It aims to extract and consume lines with proper indentation up to a specified column.
2. The identified potential error locations are within the condition checks where the function determines the column width based on tabs and spaces. The function may not accurately track the column width due to the way it calculates tab characters' contribution.
3. The bug occurs when processing tab characters and spaces in the prefix, leading to incorrect evaluation of the column width. This results in misinterpretation of the proper indentation, ultimately causing the output to deviate from the expected result.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for calculating the column width accurately, considering both tab characters and spaces. By properly handling the tab character's contribution to the column width, the function can correctly identify the required indentation.
5. Below is the corrected version of the function:

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
            else:
                # indent is finished
                current_line += char
                wait_for_nl = True
                
                if char != ' ' and char != '\t':
                    current_column += 1
                    
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By modifying the tab handling logic to correctly increment the `current_column` variable, the corrected function ensures the proper calculation of the column width, ultimately addressing the bug and aligning with the expected behavior.
