### Error Analysis
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to handle indentations and consume the prefix of a code snippet up to a specified column. 
2. The function maintains a `wait_for_nl` flag to track whether it needs to consume until the next newline character.
3. When encountering a newline character, it resets the `current_column` if it is not part of an empty line.
4. However, for the given test cases and issue scenario, the function fails to correctly consume the prefix up to the defined column position due to the incorrect handling of comment lines and indentation levels.
5. The failing tests indicate a discrepancy in the handling of comments and their indentation levels in the output.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of the comment lines and their indentation levels when consuming the prefix. This causes the comment lines to be indented differently after dedent operations, leading to failed test cases and the reported issue on GitHub.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Adjust the logic of the function to properly handle comment lines and their indentation levels.
2. Ensure that comments are aligned correctly with the rest of the code based on the provided column value.

### Corrected Function
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.lstrip().startswith('#'):
                    current_line = current_line.lstrip()  # Adjust comment indentation
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Correction Rationale
1. Modified the logic to check and adjust the comment lines' indentation to align them correctly with the code.
2. The function now correctly handles comment lines after dedent operations, ensuring they are formatted with the correct indentation.

By applying these changes, the corrected function should address the bug by consuming the prefix up to the specified column along with handling comment indentation appropriately, resolving the failed tests and the reported GitHub issue.
