### Analysis:
- The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is meant to handle consuming parts of a given prefix until a specific column position is reached, preserving the line structure.
- The issue arises when dealing with tabulated comments in the input prefix. The function does not correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent when using tabs.
- The function fails to accurately maintain the indentation level of comments which results in the failing test scenario provided.
- The key issue is the incorrect tracking of column positions when encountering tab characters and newlines, leading to misaligned comments.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the function updates the `current_column` incorrectly when encountering tab characters. It adds `4` to `current_column` for each tab, causing the column position to be incorrect.
- The incorrect handling of tab characters affects the calculation of correct indentation levels and leads to the misalignment of comments after dedentations.

### Bug Fix:
- Adjust the way the function updates the `current_column` when encountering tab characters to accurately reflect the column position.
- Ensure that the indentation level is accurately tracked to maintain proper alignment of comments after dedentations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                # Adjust tab handling to update column properly
                current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Updated Function Explanation:
- Modified the handling of tab characters by ensuring that the column position is properly updated using `(4 - (current_column % 4))`. This adjustment allows the function to accurately calculate the correct column position when encountering tabs.
- By correctly managing tab characters, the function can maintain the intended indentation levels and alignment of comments after dedentations.
- The updated function should now correctly handle tabulated comments and resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to incorrect indentation changes.
