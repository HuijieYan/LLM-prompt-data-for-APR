### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` aims to consume the prefix text until it encounters a new line while maintaining the correct indentation level based on the provided `column` value.
2. The function fails to maintain the correct indentation when encountering a `\t` character within the prefix.
3. The error message indicates a mismatch in expected and actual outcomes related to comment indentation.
4. The function incorrectly handles tabs and does not account for the correct indent within the prefix.
5. The bug reported on GitHub highlights the incorrect handling of indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of tab characters (`\t`) within the prefix text. When encountering a tab character, the function incorrectly increments the current column by a fixed value of `4`, affecting the overall indentation level.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic for handling tab characters to accurately adjust the current column based on the actual indentation level.
2. Ensure that the wait for a new line is properly managed when encountering tabs to maintain correct indentation.
3. Adjust the logic to handle tabs appropriately and match the expected behavior for comment indentation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (column - current_column % column)
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the handling of tab characters within the prefix, the corrected version ensures the correct calculation of the current column based on the actual indentation width. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test cases.
