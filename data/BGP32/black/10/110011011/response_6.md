### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming the prefix and updating current line, column, and other variables accordingly. The bug appears to be related to incorrect handling of indentation after a dedent operation. This results in different indentation levels for the comment lines in the failing test cases. The detection mechanism for waiting to consume the next line after an indent seems flawed.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Set the `wait_for_nl` flag correctly.
2. Conditionally handle the current character based on indentation type.
3. Track and update the current column correctly.

### Bug Cause:
The primary cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of `wait_for_nl` flag. When processing the indentation of the input prefix, the function does not correctly identify when to wait for the next line. This leads to inappropriate handling of the comment indentation level, resulting in differing output from the expected value.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `wait_for_nl` flag based on the current indentation state.
2. Adjust the `current_column` when consuming characters based on the correct indentation type.
3. Ensure that the comment lines are correctly aligned with the expected post-dedent indentation level.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ' or char == '\t':  # Adjust for space or tab indentation
            current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else 4  # 1 for space, 4 for tab
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should now properly handle the waiting for the next line after an indent and maintain the correct comment indentation level after a dedent operation.
