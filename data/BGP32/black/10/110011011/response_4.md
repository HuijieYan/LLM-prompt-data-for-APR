### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` aims to consume a prefix string until a certain column limit is reached. It tracks the current line, column, and whether it's waiting for a new line.
- The issue seems to be related to handling indentation and comments correctly, especially when tabs are involved. The failing test specifically checks for comment indentation after a dedent.
- Errors seem to arise as the function logic does not correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent operation.
  
### Bug Cause:
The current implementation does not correctly handle the indentations and positions in the prefix string when encountering comments after dedenting, especially when using tabs for indentation. This causes the function to incorrectly consume and return the prefix string.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in `_partially_consume_prefix` to accurately handle the indentation positions, especially regarding comments after a dedent operation. Proper handling of tabs and spacing is crucial for correct prefix consumption.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            # Handle tabs consistently
            if char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else 0
                
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
        
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Summary:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function has been addressed by updating the logic to handle tab characters consistently and correctly manage indentation positions, especially for comments after a dedent operation. This correction should resolve the reported issue on GitHub related to incorrect indentation changes for tabulated comments.
