## Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not handling the case where there is a comment after dedent correctly. It fails to maintain the correct indentation level for the comment when tabs are used. This leads to incorrect reformatting, as seen in the failing test where the comment indentation is changed. The issue on GitHub also confirms this problem.

## Bug Cause
The function fails to preserve the correct indentation of comments after a dedent when tabs are used due to the mishandling of whitespace characters while calculating the column offset.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the function needs to correctly handle the case where there is a comment after a dedent. This involves ensuring that the correct column offset is maintained for comment lines after a dedent. Proper handling of different types of whitespace characters ('\t' and ' ') is crucial to preserving the correct indentation.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By modifying the handling of tab characters to align with typical indent behavior and updating the logic for calculating the column offset, the corrected version of the function should accurately preserve the indentation of comments after a dedent when tabs are used. This fix should ensure that the failing test is passed and the issue reported on GitHub is resolved.
