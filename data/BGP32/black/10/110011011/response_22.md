### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for consuming a prefix string based on a specific column value. It handles indentation, tabs, spaces, and newlines.
2. The function seems to have an issue where it does not correctly handle the indentation for comments.
3. The failing test indicates a mismatch in the expected and actual output related to comment indentation.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation for comments within the specified column.
5. The GitHub issue aligns with the problem and describes an incorrect change in indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug arises due to the incorrect handling of column alignment and wait_for_nl flag when encountering comments. The function fails to maintain the correct indentation level for comments, leading to the failing test for comment alignment.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic in the function to correctly handle indentation for comments within the specified column.
2. Ensure that when encountering a comment, the function maintains the correct indentation based on the column value.
3. Adjust the condition checks and handling of newline characters to address the comment indentation issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            elif char == '#':  # Adjusted for comments
                lines.append(current_line)  # Ensure adding the line before adding comment
                lines.append(current_line.rstrip() + '\n')  # Add comment maintaining indentation
                current_line = ""  # Reset current_line for the next line
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the adjustments as described above, the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now correctly handle comment indentation and resolve the failing test related to comment alignment.
