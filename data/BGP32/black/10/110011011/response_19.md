## Bug Analysis:
- The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string up to a certain specified column, but it fails to handle the indentation correctly when encountering comments.
- The function incorrectly handles the wait_for_nl flag, leading to incorrect indentation of comments after dedent operations.
- The issue reported on GitHub highlights a related problem where comments are not properly aligned after dedent operations in a tab-based indentation scenario.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
- Update the logic in `_partially_consume_prefix` to properly handle the indentation of comments after dedent operations.
- Adjust the wait_for_nl flag handling to ensure correct indentation alignment of comments.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        pending_tab = False
        for char in prefix:
            if pending_tab:
                if char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                    pending_tab = False
                elif char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                    pending_tab = False
                else:
                    pending_tab = False

            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                    pending_tab = True
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                pending_tab = True
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By including the `pending_tab` flag and adjusting the logic for handling tabs and spaces, the corrected version of the function should now correctly align comments after dedent operations, resolving the reported GitHub issue.
