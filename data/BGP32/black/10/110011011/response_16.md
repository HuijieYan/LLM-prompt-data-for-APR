### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix string based on indentation rules.
2. The current implementation fails to handle tab characters correctly which causes incorrect behavior for tabulated comments after a dedent.
3. The issue reported on GitHub highlights how tabulated comments are incorrectly indented after a dedent operation, matching the behavior seen in the failing test case.
4. The misbehavior is due to the improper calculation of the indentation level when encountering tab characters.
5. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the calculation of the `current_column` when encountering tab characters.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic for handling tab characters to ensure correct calculation of the indentation level.
2. Modify the code to correctly handle indentation based on tab characters to match the expected behavior.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\t':
                next_tab_at = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
                spaces_to_add = min(next_tab_at - current_column, 4)
                current_line += ' ' * spaces_to_add
                current_column += spaces_to_add
            else:
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By incorporating the revised logic for handling tab characters, the corrected version of the function should now properly manage the indentation and resolve the bug observed in the failing tests and reported on GitHub.
