### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to process a prefix string based on indentation levels and return the consumed part. The issue seems to be related to how indentations and new lines are handled when consuming the prefix string.

### Error Location:
The error likely occurs when the function encounters a comment after a dedent and fails to properly maintain the comment's original indentation.

### Bug Cause:
1. In Case 1, the function incorrectly handles the newline character within a comment, leading to a mismatch in indentation.
2. The function does not correctly process tabs for indentation levels, as seen in Case 3.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the function processes indentation levels, particularly when encountering comments after dedents. Correctly handling tabs and spaces for indentation will ensure the function consumes the prefix string accurately.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        tab_size = 4  # Assuming 4 spaces per tab, adjust as needed

        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char

            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += tab_size
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() == '': 
                    lines.append(current_line)  # Preserve empty lines
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version takes into account the tab size for indentations and properly handles newline characters within comments or empty lines. Adjust the `tab_size` variable to the appropriate value depending on the coding standard being followed.
