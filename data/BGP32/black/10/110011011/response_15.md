### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to handle indentation level for code parsing with respect to a specified column. The bug arises when the function encounters a comment with additional whitespace or tabs. It fails to correctly handle the indentation, leading to incorrect output. The function incorrectly updates the `current_column` value and fails to properly track the column levels.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the mishandling of whitespace characters, specifically tabs and spaces when processing comments. The function updates the `current_column` value incorrectly, leading to a misalignment of the comment indentation.

### Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly tracks the indentation level of comments. When encountering whitespace characters within a comment, the function should adjust the `current_column` and handle the spacing and tabs appropriately.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Ensure correct tab spacing
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the handling of tabs and spaces within comments, the corrected version of the function should now correctly maintain the indentation levels for comments, resolving the bug.
