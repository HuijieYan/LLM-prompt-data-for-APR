### Analysis:
- The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is intended to process a given prefix string based on specific rules related to indentation.
- The function aims to correctly handle indentation levels, lines, and columns.
- However, the issue arises when handling comments with different levels of indentation after dedenting, leading to incorrect formatting.
- The buggy behavior might result from incorrect handling of newlines, column tracking, or processing of comments.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug causes incorrect behavior when handling comments post dedenting, altering their indentation level.
- In some cases, the function doesn't consider the correct column positions after dedenting, resulting in misaligned comments.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Enhance the logic to accurately handle comment indentation after dedenting.
- Ensure that comments maintain their correct alignment based on the preceding code structure.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Overview:
- Added an additional condition when encountering a newline character to differentiate between resetting column values and determining if the code should wait for the next newline to handle comments correctly after dedenting.
- The corrected version should address the issue of misaligned comments in the specified scenarios and align with the expected behavior.
