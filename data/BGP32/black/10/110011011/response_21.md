## Analysis:
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function appears to be a method within a class called `Driver`.
2. The function is designed to consume prefix characters until a certain column limit is reached and then return the consumed prefix and the remaining characters in the prefix.
3. The function seems to have trouble correctly handling the indentation levels and line breaks in the prefix text based on the input parameters and variable values provided from the failing test cases.
4. The failing test case indicates an issue related to comment indentation when using different types of indentation (space vs tab).
5. The GitHub issue points out a similar problem regarding incorrect indentation changes for tabulated comments after dedent.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The calculation of `current_column` based on different types of characters (`' '`, `'\t'`, `'\n'`) may not be correctly accounting for the actual indentation level.
2. The logic involving `wait_for_nl` to handle line breaks and column limits seems to be causing the incorrect behavior.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` appears to be related to incorrect handling of different types of characters (' ', '\t', '\n') and the logic to wait for a new line before returning the consumed prefix. This leads to improper indentation levels for comments after dedents and potentially incorrect line breaks.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Refactor the logic for calculating the current column based on character types to accurately track the indentation level.
2. Adjust the condition and handling of line breaks to ensure the correct behavior when handling new lines and preserving indentation levels.

## Updated Corrected Function:
```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if (''.join(lines).strip() and current_column < column):
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
                current_line += char
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
                current_line += char
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
                current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the above corrections, the function should now correctly consume the prefix based on the given column limit and handle the indentation levels and line breaks appropriately. This updated version aims to resolve the bug reported in the failing test case and the GitHub issue related to incorrect comment indentation after a dedent.
