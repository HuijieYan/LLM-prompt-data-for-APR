### Correction of the Bug

#### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` fails to handle the scenario where comments are present after a dedent. This results in incorrect indentation of the comment lines. The issue relates to how the function tracks the current column and waits for a new line while iterating through the prefix characters.

#### Potential Error Locations:
1. Improper handling of new line characters `\n`.
2. Incorrect logic for updating `current_column` and setting `wait_for_nl`.

#### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when the function encounters a comment after a dedent. It fails to correctly track the current column position for the comment line, leading to incorrect indentation.

#### Fix Strategy:
1. Reset the `current_line` and `current_column` when encountering a new line character `\n`.
2. Update the logic for `current_column` incrementing.
3. Adjust the `wait_for_nl` condition for efficient handling of comments after dedents.

#### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = 0
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl == 2:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = 0
            elif wait_for_nl == 1:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                elif char == '\n':
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = 2
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = 0
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = 1
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by handling comments after dedents correctly and updating the column tracking logic appropriately.
