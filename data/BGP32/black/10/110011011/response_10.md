### Bug Analysis
- The `_partially_consume_prefix` function in the `Driver` class is intended to consume a prefix, ensuring correct indentation levels before a new block of code starts.
- The bug occurs when handling newline characters within the prefix, causing incorrect indentation in the output.
- The function tracks the current indentation level and logic to identify the beginning of a new block.
- The failing test case indicates a discrepancy in comment indentation after a dedent operation.

### Error Cause
- The bug arises from a logic flaw that inaccurately handles the presence of comments within the prefix.
- The faulty logic fails to preserve the correct indentation in scenarios with trailing comments that should align with specific code lines.

### Fix Strategy
- Implement a revised logic to accurately handle comments and maintain indentation levels during prefix consumption.
- Update the logic to correctly detect the end of an indentation level and ensure comment alignment accordingly.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 8  # Change to 8 for tab width
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        res = ''.join(lines)
        if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
            res += current_line
        return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

### Summary
The corrected version adjusts the logic for handling tab characters and newline characters correctly to maintain consistent indentation, thereby resolving the bug present in the original function.
