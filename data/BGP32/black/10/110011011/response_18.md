### Analysis:
1. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string until it reaches a certain column, maintaining the indentation levels based on spaces, tabs, and newlines. However, based on the failing test case and the provided inputs, the function fails to correctly handle the indentation of comments.
2. The function does not effectively handle the scenarios where a comment is involved after dedenting, resulting in incorrect behavior during the parsing of the prefix.
3. The failing test case reveals that the comment indentation is being adjusted incorrectly, leading to a mismatch in the expected vs. actual output due to improper handling of comment lines.
4. To resolve this bug, the function should keep track of comment lines separately and maintain their relative indentation based on the surrounding code indentation.
5. The corrected version of the function should accurately handle comment lines' indentation, ensuring they align correctly with the code structure.

### Updated Function to Fix the Bug:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        in_comment = False  # Track if the current parsing point is within a comment
    
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl and char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ' and not in_comment:
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t' and not in_comment:
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                in_comment = False  # Reset comment flag on encountering a newline
            elif char == '#':
                in_comment = True  # Set comment flag when a comment begins
            elif char not in [' ', '\t'] and not in_comment:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By incorporating the `in_comment` flag and avoiding updating the `current_column` when processing comment lines, the corrected function ensures that comments maintain their relative indentation with the code structure. This modification addresses the bug related to incorrect comment indentation after a dedent, as reported in the GitHub issue.
