### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to take a prefix string and consume a partial part of it based on the specified column. The bug arises when the function encounters a comment after dedenting. It fails to maintain the correct indentation for the comment, resulting in incorrect output.

### Error Location
The bug seems to be located in the handling of comments and dedent cases within the `for` loop of the function. Specifically, the issue lies in how the function processes the current line and the column count while handling comments and newline characters.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function fails to correctly manage the indentation level of comments in cases where there is an indent level change. This leads to incorrect handling of comments after a dedent, ultimately causing the indentation to be misplaced in the output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the cases where the comment indentation needs to be aligned with the main code and account for any dedent scenarios. The logic within the `for` loop that determines the column and line structure should be adjusted to ensure correct comment indentation.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column > 0:
                wait_for_nl = True
                current_line = current_line.strip()
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
        else:
            current_column = 0

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function takes into account proper handling of comments and indentations after dedent scenarios, ensuring the correct formatting of the output.
