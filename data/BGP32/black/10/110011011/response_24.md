### Analyzing the buggy function
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is part of the `Driver` class.
- The function is meant to partially consume a prefix based on a given column value.
- The function processes each character in the prefix and adjusts the current line and column accordingly.
- The main issue seems to be with the indentation and waiting for a new line (NL).
- The failing test `test_comment_indentation` indicates a problem with comment indentation when using tabs.

### Identified potential error locations
1. Handling of tabulation characters and spaces.
2. Logic related to identifying when to wait for a new line.
3. Consideration for comment indentation after a dedent.

### Explanation of the bug
- The function fails to appropriately handle tabulation characters when processing text containing tabs.
- As a result, the comment indentation is not maintained correctly after a dedent.
- The failing test `test_comment_indentation` highlights the discrepancy in comment indentation between spaces and tabs.

### Bug-fixing strategy
1. Ensure proper handling of tab characters, adjusting the current column appropriately.
2. Address the logic that determines when to wait for a new line correctly.
3. Consider the specific case of comments and their indentation after dedents.
4. Modify the function to account for the differences in indentation between spaces and tabs.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Adjust tab space as needed
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                if current_line.strip().startswith("#"):  # Adjust comment indentation
                    current_line = current_line.lstrip()  # Remove leading whitespace
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                # indent is finished
                current_line += char
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By revising the handling of tab characters, addressing the comment indentation logic after dedents, and ensuring proper waiting for new lines, this corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
