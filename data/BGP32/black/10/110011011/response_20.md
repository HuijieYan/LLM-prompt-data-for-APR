### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume the given prefix based on a specified column. The issue arises when handling comments with different levels of indentation. In the failing test case, the function is incorrectly consuming the prefix for comments with tab indentation.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function does not handle indentation levels correctly when encountering comments. The calculation of the current column is inaccurate, leading to incorrect handling of comments which results in an incorrect output compared to the expected output.

### Potential Error Locations
1. Incorrect calculation of the current column based on different indentation characters.
2. Inadequate handling of comments and their indentation levels.

### Fix Strategy
To address the bug, the function should accurately track the indentation levels for different characters such as spaces, tabs, and newline characters. Proper handling of comments with varying levels of indentation is crucial to fix this issue.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version includes a more accurate calculation of the current column for different indentation types, which should resolve the indentation issue for comments. It ensures that the function handles comments with varying indentation levels appropriately.
