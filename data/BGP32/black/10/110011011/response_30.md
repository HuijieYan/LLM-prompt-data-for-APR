### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function when handling the indentation level after a dedent with tab characters. The current implementation does not correctly adjust the column position when encountering tab characters. As a result, the output format differs from the expected format after a dedent.

The error message shows a discrepancy between the expected output with spaces and the actual output with tabs, specifically related to comment indentation after a dedent.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of tab characters and their impact on the `current_column` calculation.
2. Logic related to `wait_for_nl` and `current_column` handling.
3. Incorrect appending of the `current_line` to `lines`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to the incorrect handling of tab characters during the calculation of the `current_column` position. The current implementation overlooks the increase in indentation level by 4 when encountering tab characters. This miscalculation leads to the misplacement of comments and incorrect indentation levels in the output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To address the bug, we need to adjust the calculation of the `current_column` correctly when encountering tab characters in the input prefix. Properly accounting for the tab character's impact on the indentation level will ensure the correct formatting after a dedent.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                current_line += char
                if wait_for_nl:
                    if char == '\n':
                        if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                            res = ''.join(lines)
                            return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                        lines.append(current_line)
                        current_line = ""
                        current_column = 0
                        wait_for_nl = False
                elif char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\n':
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the calculation of `current_column` inside the loop to properly handle tab characters, we ensure that the function adjusts the indentation level accurately. This correction should resolve the issue and align the output formatting with the expected format.
