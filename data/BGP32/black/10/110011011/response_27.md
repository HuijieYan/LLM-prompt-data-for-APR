### Analysis:
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is meant to partially consume a prefix string based on column values and whitespace characters.
2. The bug seems to be related to the handling of indentation and new lines within the prefix string.
3. The failing test indicates a mismatch in expected and actual output for comment indentation after a dedent in the input string.
4. The function fails to correctly handle the indentation levels after a dedent, leading to the incorrect output.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function doesn't reset the current_line properly, causing issues with correct column handling after dedents, especially related to comment indentation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, properly handle the resetting of `current_line` and `current_column` when encountering new lines or indents after dedents. Adjust the logic to maintain correct indentation levels based on the input column.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False

        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char

            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # Reset current_line and column after new line
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # Check if indent is finished
                if char != ' ' and char != '\t':
                    wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By resetting `current_line` and `current_column` correctly, the corrected version of the function should handle the indentation and comment alignment issues as described in the failing GitHub issue.
