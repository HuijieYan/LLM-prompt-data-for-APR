### Analysis:
1. The `partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to consume a prefix within a given column. However, it fails to correctly handle the logic to consume the prefix according to the column value.
2. The key issue lies in the handling of tab characters and counting columns.
3. The failing test case shows that when dealing with tabs and comments, the columns are not counted accurately, leading to incorrect indentation.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure correct column counting when encountering tab characters and when waiting for a new line.

### Correction Strategy:
1. Adjust the column count logic to correctly handle tab characters.
2. Ensure that the function accurately captures the indentation level and consumes the prefix based on the specified column.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                # Adjust column count for tabs
                if (current_column // 4) * 4 == current_column:
                    current_column += 4
                else:
                    current_column += 4 - current_column % 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the column count logic for tab characters, the corrected version of the function handles indentation correctly and should pass the failing test identified in the GitHub issue.
