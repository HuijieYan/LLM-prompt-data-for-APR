### Analysis:
- The given function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string up to a certain column, considering spaces, tabs, and new lines.
- The function has a logical error in handling comments where the indentation after dedent is not maintained correctly.
- The issue reported on GitHub points out the incorrect indentation behavior for comments when tabs are used in the input file.
- The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is due to the incorrect handling of comment indentation after a dedent in the prefix string.

### Bug Cause:
- The buggy function fails to preserve the correct indentation for comments after a dedent when the input contains tabs.
- The function incorrectly counts the columns for tab characters causing the mismatch in comment indentation compared to the expected output.
- This bug causes the failing test `test_comment_indentation` to identify the incorrect output during comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Adjust the column calculation logic to ensure that tab characters are appropriately counted to maintain correct indentation for comments.
- Correctly reset the column count after a new line character to handle the indentation properly.
- Refactor the logic to account for tab characters' virtual spacing value when calculating the column position.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Adjust for tab spacing
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0  # Reset column count on new line
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the calculation for tab characters and resetting the column count on new lines, the corrected function should now preserve correct comment indentation after dedents, and the failing test should pass.
