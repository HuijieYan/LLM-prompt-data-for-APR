### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has a logic issue in handling the indentation levels when encountering tabs (`\t`). It incorrectly calculates the `current_column` value for tabs by directly incrementing by `4`, which isn't aligned with the actual levels of tabs. This leads to incorrect handling of indentation when encountering tabulated content.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Instead of directly incrementing by `4` for tabs, we need to adjust the `current_column` according to the actual tabulation level.
2. Modify the logic to adjust the `current_column` properly for tabs and ensure correct handling of tabulated content.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\t':
                tab_size = 4
                if wait_for_nl:
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                current_column += tab_size - (current_column % tab_size)
            else:
                current_line += char
                if wait_for_nl:
                    if char == '\n':
                        if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                            res = ''.join(lines)
                            return res, prefix[len(res):]

                        lines.append(current_line)
                        current_line = ""
                        current_column = 0
                        wait_for_nl = False
                elif char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\n':
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic to handle tabs correctly in the above corrected version of the function, the issue reported on GitHub regarding incorrect handling of tabulated comments after a dedent should be resolved.
