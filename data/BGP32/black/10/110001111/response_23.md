### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume the prefix text until reaching a certain column limit.
2. The function maintains the current line, current column position, a list of lines, and a flag `wait_for_nl` to handle newline characters and indentation levels.
3. The bug occurs when a newline character is encountered in the prefix. In Case 1, when the function encounters a newline character, it resets the current column position to 0, which is incorrect behavior.
4. The issue described in the GitHub problem statement is related to incorrect handling of tabulated comments after a dedent.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the current column position is correctly maintained when encountering newline characters.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the premature resetting of the `current_column` variable to 0 when a newline character is encountered, regardless of the actual indentation level.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we should update the code to only reset the `current_column` if the line is not empty after stripping and if the current column is less than the target column. Otherwise, we should maintain the current indentation level.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                if current_column < column:
                    current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            if current_column < column:
                current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected function ensures that the `current_column` is only reset to 0 if the line is not empty after stripping and if the current column is less than the target column. This fix addresses the issue of incorrect indentation after a newline character and aligns with the expected behavior specified in the failing tests.
