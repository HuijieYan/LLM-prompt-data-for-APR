### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function when handling cases where the indentation level changes due to tabs and spaces. The function is not correctly handling the combination of tabs and spaces when determining the current column in the prefix string. This leads to incorrect calculation of the current column and results in misalignment of the output lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the current column is correctly calculated when encountering tabs and spaces in the prefix string. Adjusting the logic to consider both tabs and spaces will enable the correct calculation of the current column and ensure proper handling of the prefix string.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        else:
            current_column += 1

        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By taking into account both tabs and spaces when calculating the current column, the corrected function should now properly handle the prefix string and align the output lines based on the specified column value.
