### Bug Analysis
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to process a given prefix string up to a specified column value. It splits the prefix into lines based on the indentation level.
2. The bug is causing incorrect handling of tab characters and newline characters, leading to unexpected results.
3. The bug occurs due to incorrect tracking of the current column and handling of tab characters.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correctly calculate the column position when encountering tab characters and adjust the logic for handling indents and newlines.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the logic for tab character processing to increment the `current_column` appropriately.
2. Modify the condition checks for spaces, tabs, and newlines to accurately track the column position and line breaks.
3. Ensure that the correct values are stored and returned for `current_line` and `lines` during prefix processing.

### Corrected Function
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Adjust based on tab width
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line + char)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                if current_column < column:
                    current_line += char
                wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected function now accurately tracks the column position and processes tab characters and newlines correctly. This should address the indentation issue described in the GitHub problem statement.
