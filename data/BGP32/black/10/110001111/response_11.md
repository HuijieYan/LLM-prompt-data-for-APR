The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the incorrect handling of leading whitespace in comments, especially when tabs are involved. The function fails to maintain the correct level of indentation for comments after a dedent operation. This issue causes the comments to be misaligned, as described in the GitHub issue where tabulated comments lose their expected alignment.

One possible strategy to fix this bug is to ensure that the function correctly handles different types of whitespace characters (spaces, tabs) and maintains the correct indentation levels when processing comments. By adjusting the logic related to whitespace and indentation tracking, the function can be corrected to handle comments properly, as expected.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char in [' ', '\t']:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                else:
                    current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_column > 0:
                    # adjusting indentation after dedent for tabs
                    ws = ' ' * (current_column - 1) if prefix.startswith('\t') else ' ' * current_column
                    current_line = ws + current_line.lstrip()
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        if current_line and current_column < column:
            res = ''.join(lines)
            return res, prefix[len(res):]
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the issue by ensuring that the correct amount of whitespace is added to the comment lines based on the previous level of indentation. It checks for tabs in the input and adjusts the whitespace accordingly to maintain the expected alignment of comments. This fix should resolve the problem described in the GitHub issue.
