The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to the incorrect handling of indentation when encountering tab characters ('\t'). The function fails to properly account for the tab character's impact on the current column count, leading to incorrect behavior when processing tabs and subsequent characters.

The cause of the bug arises from the mismanagement of the `current_column` variable in relation to tab characters. Tabs should increment the column count by 4, reflecting their typical behavior in an indentation context. However, the function only increments the column count by 1 for each tab character encountered, leading to incorrect tracking of the current column position.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the handling of tab characters in the function so that they contribute 4 units to the `current_column` value. This change will align the function's behavior with typical tab indentation rules and ensure correct processing of the input prefix.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Fix: Increment current_column by 4 for tabs
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle tab characters and maintain the expected behavior for indentation processing.
