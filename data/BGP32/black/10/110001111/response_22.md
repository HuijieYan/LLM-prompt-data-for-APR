### Bug Identification
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` fails to correctly handle lines with tabs and spaces, causing incorrect indentation in some cases. The function is not updating the `current_column` value properly when encountering tabs.

### Bug Explanation
In Case 3, the input `prefix = '\t# comment\n\t'` and `column = 2` should result in `current_column` being updated correctly. However, when encountering a tab character (`char = '\t'`), the function should increment `current_column` by 8 (instead of 4 for space) to account for tabs. But here, the function incorrectly increments `current_column` by 4 when encountering a tab, causing incorrect indentation handling.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the `current_column` value correctly when encountering tab characters in the input prefix. We should increment `current_column` by 4 for space characters, 1 for tab characters, and reset it to 0 for newline characters. Additionally, the handling of empty lines should not affect the indentation levels.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the above changes, the function should now correctly handle prefixes containing tabs and spaces, maintaining the proper indentation levels as expected.
