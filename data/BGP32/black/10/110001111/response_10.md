### Bug Analysis:
1. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix up to a specific column based on indentation rules.
2. The bug is likely due to incorrect handling of tab characters ('\t') in updating the `current_column`.
3. The function fails to handle tabs correctly, leading to inconsistencies in calculating the `current_column`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic for handling tab characters to properly increment the `current_column` by 4 spaces as per Python standard.
2. Ensure that the function correctly tracks indentation changes based on spaces and tabs to accurately determine the consumed prefix.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':  # Handle tab character
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the function to handle tab characters and spaces correctly, the corrected version should address the bug identified and satisfy the expected input/output values. This fix should align with the reported issue on GitHub related to incorrect indentation changes for tabulated comments after a dedent.
