### Potential Error Locations
1. The condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` may not be correctly evaluating whether the current line should be appended to the `lines` list or not.
2. The calculation of `current_column` when encountering '\t' might not be accurate.
3. Reinitializing `current_column` to 0 when encountering '\n' might be incorrect.
4. The logic for handling space characters and controlling `wait_for_nl` could be flawed.

### Cause of the Bug
1. The bug seems to trigger due to incorrect handling of tab characters when calculating the column position. This can lead to unexpected behavior in the function where the expected indentation is not maintained.
2. When encountering '\t' characters, the increment of `current_column` by 4 may not be aligned with the actual tab width in terms of column counting.
3. Resetting `current_column` to 0 for every '\n' character might disrupt the correct column tracking.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Adjust the calculation of `current_column` based on '\t' characters to ensure proper column tracking.
2. Modify the conditions for appending lines to properly handle the expected indentation levels.
3. Maintain the correct `current_column` value across different characters.
4. Properly synchronize the `wait_for_nl` flag with the expected behavior when encountering different characters to handle indentation accurately.


### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                if current_line.strip() and len(lines) > 0 and lines[-1].count('\t') < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the tab character handling and refining the logic for checking and appending lines based on the specified column indentation, the corrected version of the function should address the issue and accurately maintain the expected indentation levels.
