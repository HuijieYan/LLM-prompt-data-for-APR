### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a given prefix based on a specified column. It accumulates characters until a specific condition is met (such as encountering a newline) and then returns the consumed lines along with the remaining prefix.

However, the issue seems to be related to the logic of handling spaces, tabs, and newlines. This can be seen from the failing test cases where the expected and actual behavior do not match.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In Case 1, the function is not handling the scenario where the prefix ends with a newline (\n) correctly. The current logic fails to consider the case where the last character of the prefix is a newline, which leads to incorrect behavior.
2. In Case 3, when encountering a tab character (\t), the current_column is incremented by 4 instead of 1, causing the incorrect count of columns.
3. The use of `wait_for_nl` seems to be the cause of unexpected behavior when transitioning between line breaks and other characters.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Correctly handle the edge cases related to newline characters in the prefix.
2. Adjust the column count logic for tab characters to count as 1 instead of 4.
3. Ensure that the logic for `wait_for_nl` is correctly followed to handle transitions between characters.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_line += char
                wait_for_nl = True
                
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the adjustments mentioned above, the corrected version of the function should now handle the edge cases and scenarios described in the failing test cases. This should align the function's behavior with the expected input/output values and resolve the GitHub issue related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
