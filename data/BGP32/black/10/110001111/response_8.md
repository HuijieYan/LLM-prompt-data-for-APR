### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for processing a given prefix string based on a specified column value.
2. The function iterates through the characters in the prefix string, calculating the current line content and column position based on spaces, tabs, and newline characters.
3. The bug causes incorrect handling of indentation after a dedent operation, leading to an unexpected format of the comment lines.
4. The `wait_for_nl` flag is used to determine whether to wait for a newline character before processing the next line.
5. The issue reported on GitHub relates to incorrect indentation changes for tabulated comments after a dedent operation.
6. The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of column positions after dedent operations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the logic related to column calculation to ensure proper tracking of the current indentation level.
2. Update the condition involving the `wait_for_nl` flag to handle situations where the comment indentation level needs to be preserved.
3. Make sure that the function correctly handles tab characters and their impact on column positions.
4. Test the function with various test cases to validate the fix and ensure it aligns with the expected behavior.
5. Ensure that the corrected function addresses the GitHub issue by maintaining proper comment indentation after dedent operations.

### Corrected Function:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                wait_for_nl = True
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these corrections, the function should now handle the prefix string correctly and maintain the expected column positions when processing comments with different levels of indentation.
