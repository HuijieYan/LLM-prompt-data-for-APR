### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume part of a prefix to reach a certain column boundary. It processes characters one by one, handling spaces, tabs, newlines, and indent levels. However, there seems to be an issue with maintaining the correct current column count especially after encountering newlines. This leads to incorrect behavior when a comment is encountered after a dedent operation.

### Error locations
1. The calculation of `current_column` is off, especially around handling newlines.
2. The logic for `wait_for_nl` to handle indents is causing unexpected behavior.

### Cause of the bug
The bug stems from incorrect tracking of the current column during the processing of the prefix. When encountering a newline, the current column is not reset properly, leading to misalignment of the subsequent comment indentation relative to the code.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
- Ensure that the `current_column` is reset correctly when encountering a newline.
- Adjust the logic for `wait_for_nl` to trigger only after encountering non-whitespace characters.
- Make sure that the handling of spaces and tabs is consistent with Python's indentation rules.

### Code fix
```python
class Driver(object):
    
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            current_line += char
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version addresses the issues mentioned above, ensuring proper handling of indents and newlines to maintain correct column alignment.
