The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be related to how indentation and new lines are handled. Specifically, the function incorrectly stores lines and their indentation levels leading to issues with comments and tabulation.

Based on the provided runtime values and expected values, it seems that the function is not correctly updating the `lines` list and handling the indentation levels for different characters like spaces, tabs, and new lines.

To fix the bug, one approach could be to adjust how the function tracks lines and their corresponding indentation levels. When encountering new lines or different indentation characters, it should correctly update the current line and column values to reflect the changes in the input prefix.

Here is a corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                if not wait_for_nl:
                    wait_for_nl = True
            
            current_line += char
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should address the issue of incorrect indentation and handling of comments after a dedent, as described in the GitHub issue. The function now properly maintains the lines list and updates the current line and column values according to the prefix input.
