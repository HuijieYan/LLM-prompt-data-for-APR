### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is meant to process a prefix string by handling indentation levels and line breaks based on a provided column value.
2. The function iterates through each character of the prefix string and updates the current line and current column according to tabs, spaces, and newlines.
3. The bug occurs when the function encounters a newline while waiting for the indent to finish, resulting in incorrect handling of the current column and line.
4. The issue reported on GitHub relates to incorrect indentation of comments after a dedent, indicating a problem with tabulated comments and indentation changes.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of a newline character while waiting for the indentation to finish. This leads to misalignment of columns and improper splitting of lines, causing unexpected behavior in scenarios involving tabulated comments and indentations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug:
1. Adjust the logic to correctly handle the scenario when a newline character is encountered while waiting for the indent to finish.
2. Ensure that the splitting of lines and column tracking occurs accurately to maintain the intended structure and alignment of the prefix string.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function addresses the issue by properly handling the newline character, ensuring correct splitting of lines and tracking of columns. This revision should resolve the bug and align with the expected input/output values for various test cases provided.
