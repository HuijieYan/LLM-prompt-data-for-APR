### Analysis:
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to partially consume the prefix string until a certain column limit is reached. It maintains track of lines, the current line, current column count, and a flag `wait_for_nl` to control the behavior. 
2. The bug occurs when the function encounters an unexpected empty line character (`'\n'`), which does not reset the current column count as intended.
3. The function fails to correctly handle cases where the current column exceeds the provided column parameter.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when encountering an empty line character, the current column count gets reset to 0 regardless of `wait_for_nl` state.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
By modifying the logic to consider resetting the current column count whenever encountering `'\n'`, we can address the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # Reset the current column count
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
                
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version includes the logic to reset the current column count whenever encountering a new line character. This change addresses the bug identified in the function.
