### Analyzing the buggy function
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is part of the `Driver` class.
2. It takes two input parameters: `prefix` (a string) and `column` (an integer), and attempts to partially consume the prefix based on a given column value.
3. The function processes each character in the prefix and adjusts the current line and column values accordingly.
4. The function has a bug where it fails to correctly handle the indentation and newline characters, leading to incorrect processing of the prefix.

### Identifying potential error locations
1. The condition for checking `wait_for_nl` and the subsequent checks for various characters like space, tab, and newline are potential error locations.
2. Incorrect updating of `current_column`, `current_line`, and `wait_for_nl` may cause unexpected behavior.

### Explaining the bug
In the provided buggy function, the handling of newline characters is causing incorrect behavior. Specifically:
- When encountering a newline character (`'\n'`) and `wait_for_nl` is `True`, the function does not correctly reset `current_line` and `current_column`.
- This leads to incorrect line formation and eventual wrong return values.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when a newline character is encountered:
1. If `wait_for_nl` is `True`, reset `current_line` and `current_column`.
2. Make sure to handle the indentation correctly when processing the prefix.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    current_line += char
            else:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                elif char == '\n':
                    current_column = 0
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
                    current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures proper handling of newline characters and correct updating of `current_line` and `current_column`. It addresses the identified issue and aligns with the expected input/output values for the test cases provided.
