### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for parsing and consuming a prefix based on indentation in the input string.
2. The function keeps track of the current line, column, a list of lines, and a flag for waiting for a new line to indicate the end of the indentation.
3. The bug arises when the function encounters unexpected cases related to newline characters and indentation levels, leading to incorrect output.
4. The existing implementation fails to correctly handle the indentation levels and newline characters within the prefix string, resulting in unexpected behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of the newline characters and the corresponding indentation levels in the input string. The function fails to properly reset the `current_column` and `current_line` variables when dealing with newlines, leading to incorrect calculations of the indentation levels.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the newline characters to reset the column and line when necessary. Additionally, the function should accurately track the current indentation level for the prefix lines.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            current_line = ''
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version includes resetting the `current_line` when encountering a newline character to ensure accurate tracking of the indentation levels. Additionally, the `current_column` is reset to 0 when a newline is encountered to handle indentation correctly.
