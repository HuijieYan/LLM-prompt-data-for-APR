The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be related to the incorrect handling of indentation levels when encountering tabs or spaces. It fails to properly consume and maintain the indentation levels of the prefix string, resulting in incorrect behavior.

The issue can be traced back to the wrong calculation of the `current_column` value when encountering tabs in the prefix string. The function should correctly increment `current_column` by 4 when a tab is encountered rather than always incrementing by 4.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic of calculating `current_column` based on the type of character encountered (space, tab, newline). We should adjust the increment value for `current_column` accordingly to handle spaces and tabs correctly. Additionally, we need to update the `res` variable to include the lines read so far and properly return it.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should now properly handle indentation levels for both spaces and tabs in the prefix string, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the issue raised on GitHub.
