### Analysis:
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is intended to consume a prefix string up to a specific column stopping at the first newline character encountered after that column. However, the current implementation of the function has a bug that incorrectly handles whitespace characters like tabs and spaces, leading to incorrect behavior. The bug causes the function to misinterpret the input prefix, leading to incorrect results.

### Error Locations:
1. The handling of tab characters and spaces is incorrect, leading to incorrect column calculations.
2. The logic for handling newline characters and resetting column/counters is flawed.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the mishandling of tab and space characters, which results in an incorrect calculation of the current column. This causes the function to incorrectly determine when to stop consuming the prefix up to the specified column. As a result, the function fails to correctly extract the prefix and the remainder of the input string.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle tab and space characters when calculating the current column. Additionally, the logic for newline characters should be reassessed to ensure the correct resetting of counters. By addressing these issues, the function should be able to properly extract the prefix up to the specified column.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4   # Corrected, tab counts as 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                current_line = ""      # Corrected, reset current_line inside newline condition
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the corrections as shown above, the function should now be able to correctly consume the prefix up to the specified column while handling tab and space characters appropriately.
