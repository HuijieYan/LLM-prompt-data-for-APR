### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs when processing characters in the `prefix` string where the indentation level is less than the specified `column`. In such cases, the function does not correctly handle the characters and their associated columns, resulting in incorrect output.

### Bug Cause:
1. When encountering a newline character (`\n`) with `wait_for_nl` set to `True`, the function incorrectly assumes that the current line should be added to `lines`. This leads to premature addition of lines.
2. The handling of indentation levels with spaces or tabs is incorrect, especially when approaching the specified `column`.
3. During the processing of some characters, the function does not update the `current_column` value correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Correctly manage the addition of lines based on valid conditions.
2. Ensure that the calculation of the current indentation column is accurate for spaces and tabs.
3. Update `current_column` appropriately for each character processed.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if wait_for_nl:
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version addresses the issues by correctly handling line addition, updating the current indentation column for spaces and tabs, and ensuring the accurate tracking of the current column value during character processing.
