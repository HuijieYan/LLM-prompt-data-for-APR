**Analysis:**

1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to handle prefix parsing where comments might start with spaces or tabs. It should properly calculate the indentation level and handle new lines or tabs.
   
2. The bug causes incorrect handling of the indentation, especially when encountering comments after dedent operations.

**Bug Location:**

The bug likely occurs due to incorrect handling of indentation levels and new lines/tabs in the input prefix string.

**Bug Explanation:**

- Case 1: The function correctly processes the given prefix string until a new line character `'\n'` is encountered. At this point, it incorrectly resets the current column to 0 instead of maintaining the previous indentation level.

- Case 2: In this case, where the prefix is an empty string, the function correctly initializes the variables but does not handle any explicit indentation levels, leading to potential issues with subsequent indentation calculations.

- Case 3: The function correctly splits the initial prefix string based on the tabs and processes the content till the new line `'\n'`. However, the current column value is not updated correctly when the function waits for the next newline character.

- Case 4: Similar to case 2, when the prefix is an empty string, the function initializes the variables but fails to handle any specific indentation levels required for accurate parsing.

- Case 5: The function handles the prefix string containing both spaces and tabs correctly but encounters issues when dealing with the correct indentation level for the comment line.

**Bug Fix Strategy:**

To fix the bug and address the GitHub issue related to incorrect indentation after dedent operations, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` needs to be revised to properly track and update the current indentation level. 

**Updated Corrected Version:**

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset current_line when encountering a new line
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # Adjust the indentation level when encountering non-space/tab characters
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line

```

By incorporating the necessary adjustments to handle the current indentation levels correctly, the updated function should now properly consume the prefix input based on the specified column value. This correction will help address the indentation issues highlighted in the GitHub report.
