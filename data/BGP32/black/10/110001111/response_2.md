The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the incorrect handling of tabs for indentation count. This results in incorrect indentation processing, especially with tab characters. To address this issue, we need to adjust the way tabs are counted for the `current_column`.

The strategy to fix this bug involves accurately calculating the `current_column` by considering tabs as 4 spaces each. We should update the `current_column` value accordingly when encountering tab characters during the iteration over the `prefix`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Update tab calculation to count as 4 spaces
            elif char == '\n':
                # Unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # Indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures that tab characters are correctly handled by counting them as 4 spaces each, maintaining proper indentation processing.
