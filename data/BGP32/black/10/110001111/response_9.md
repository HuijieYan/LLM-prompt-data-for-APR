### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function stems from the logic related to handling the indentation levels based on spaces and tabs. When encountering a new line character (`\n`), the function should reset the current column counter to 0, but it doesn't consider the case where the line might start with spaces or tabs. This results in incorrect indentation handling, leading to unexpected behavior such as misalignments in comments and code after dedents.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to adjust the logic related to resetting the current column counter when encountering a new line character. Specifically, we should reset the current column counter to 0 only when the line consists of only whitespaces (spaces or tabs). This adjustment will ensure proper handling of indentation levels as expected and resolve the GitHub issue related to incorrect indentation changes for tabulated comments after a dedent.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() == '' and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                if current_line.isspace():
                    current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.isspace():
                current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the adjustment in the condition where the line is checked for containing only whitespaces, the function now correctly handles the indentation levels for different scenarios, ensuring the expected behavior and resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
