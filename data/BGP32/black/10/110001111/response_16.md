### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `partially_consume_prefix` is incorrectly handling the indentation when encountering tabs and newlines. It fails to correctly update the `current_column` value when encountering a tab character which causes incorrect behavior when determining the indentation level of the prefix. This leads to incorrect splitting of the lines and inconsistent line indentation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `current_column` variable is updated correctly when encountering tab characters. This will allow for the correct calculation of the indentation level and ensure the proper splitting of lines.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            to_next_tab = 8 - (current_column % 8)
            if wait_for_nl:
                current_line += ' ' * to_next_tab
                current_column += to_next_tab
            else:
                current_column += to_next_tab
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By correctly calculating the space needed to reach the next tab stop and updating `current_column` accordingly, the corrected version of the function should now handle tabs and newlines properly, ensuring the correct indentation detection and splitting of lines.
