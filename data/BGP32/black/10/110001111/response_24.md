### Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function, `_partially_consume_prefix`, is supposed to partially consume a given prefix string based on a specified column value. It processes the characters in the prefix string according to indentation rules, increasing the current column count for spaces and tabs encountered until it reaches the target column. Once the target column is reached, it waits for a newline character to finish indentation, adding lines to the `lines` list.

### Error Locations

1. The logic inside the `if wait_for_nl` block where lines are added to the list when encountering a newline character seems incorrect.
2. Incorrect handling of the current line and column values based on the character encountered.
3. The return statement at the end of the function where the lines are joined may not include the last line correctly.


### Cause of the Bug

The bug seems to be caused by incorrect handling of the current line and column values when processing characters in the prefix string. The issue arises when the function encounters a newline character amidst whitespace characters while waiting to reach the specified column. This results in incorrect indentation and potentially missing lines.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic in detecting when to add a line to the list properly and ensure correct tracking of the current line and column values. Additionally, the final return statement should handle the remaining characters after processing the prefix string correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by adjusting the logic for handling the newline character, updating the current line and column values accurately, and correctly handling the return of the remaining characters after processing the prefix string.
