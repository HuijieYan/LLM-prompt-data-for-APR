## Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a portion of a prefix string based on a specified column number. The function processes each character in the prefix string, accumulating characters in `current_line` until it reaches a certain column count. However, there are issues with the logic, leading to incorrect behavior and failing the test cases.

1. In the given test scenario, the function fails to correctly handle indentation spaces and tab characters and does not consider newline characters correctly in some cases. This causes the function to return incorrect results when processing prefixes containing different types of indentation.

2. The function tracks the current column count based on spaces and tabs, but it does not reset the count when encountering a newline character. This results in incorrect column tracking when the prefix contains multiple lines.

3. The `wait_for_nl` flag, meant to indicate that the function is waiting for a newline character after finishing indentation, is not consistently set/unset, leading to premature checks for newlines.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, the following steps can be taken:

1. Adjust the logic to correctly handle different types of indentation (spaces, tabs) and newline characters. Update the column count based on these characters accordingly.

2. Reset the column count to 0 whenever a newline character is encountered to start counting indentation from the beginning of the line.

3. Ensure that the `wait_for_nl` flag is properly set and reset to accurately wait for newline characters when the initial indentation is complete.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is a corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version addresses the issues in the original function by properly handling indentation, resetting column count on newline characters, and managing the `wait_for_nl` flag. The corrected version should now pass the failing test cases provided.
