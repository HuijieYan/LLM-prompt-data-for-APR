The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the condition when `wait_for_nl` is True, and a newline character is encountered. At this point, the function checks if the current line is not empty and if `current_column < column`, if both conditions are met, it concatenates the lines and returns the result. However, the bug is that the condition `current_column < column` is incorrect, as it should be `current_column <= column` to include cases where the column is equal to the given `column`. This bug causes the function to fail for cases where the column is equal to the specified column.

To fix this bug, we need to update the condition `current_column < column` to `current_column <= column` in the if statement block inside the loop.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By making this small change in the comparison condition, the function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
