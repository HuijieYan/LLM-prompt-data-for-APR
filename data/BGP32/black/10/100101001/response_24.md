The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to how the current_column is updated and checked. The current_column should not be updated when encountering '\n' as it represents a new line, and it should not count towards the current column. This leads to incorrect column tracking and causes the function to return incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic where the current_column is updated only for ' ' and '\t' characters, not for '\n'. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_line = ""
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle new lines and accurately track the column counts. The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
