### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs because the condition to check and return the result when the current column is less than the desired column is incorrect. The current implementation checks if the current character is a new line character before validating the column count. This causes premature returns and incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to validate the column count before checking for a new line character. Additionally, we need to handle cases where the prefix does not contain a new line character.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if current_column >= column:
                if char == '\n':
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
        res = ''.join(lines)
        return res, prefix[len(res):]
        
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function fixes the bug by correctly handling the condition for checking the column count before new line characters. This should now pass the failing test cases.
