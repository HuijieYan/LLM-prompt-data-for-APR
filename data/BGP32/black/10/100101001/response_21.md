The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix up to a certain column, taking into account indentation and empty lines. However, the issue arises when the function encounters a comment line, causing it to misinterpret the indentation level.

The root cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly handles comment lines, leading to the incorrect identification of the end of the indentation block. When processing comment lines, the function should not treat them as ending the indentation block.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic in the function to skip processing comment lines and continue checking for the end of the indentation block correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':
            # Skip processing comment lines
            current_line = current_line.rstrip()
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This correction addresses the issue with comment lines interrupting the indentation processing, ensuring that the function correctly captures the indentation levels before and after the comment while ignoring the comment lines themselves. This correction should make the function work as intended and pass the failing test cases.
