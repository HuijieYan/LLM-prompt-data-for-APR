### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has a logical issue in handling the indentation levels. The function is intended to consume the prefix until a certain column is reached, taking into account spaces, tabs, and newlines. However, the current implementation fails to correctly identify when to stop consuming the prefix, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Location:
The bug is primarily located in the condition where the function decides to wait for a newline to finish the indentation. The condition is not correctly triggered, causing the function to return incorrect values.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to revisit the logic that determines when to wait for a newline to finish the indentation level. We should ensure that the function correctly identifies when the desired column is reached, considering spaces, tabs, and newlines.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the condition `if current_column <= column`, we ensure that the function stops consuming the prefix when the desired column is reached, including the case where the column matches exactly. This correction should address the bug and make the function work correctly with the provided test cases.
