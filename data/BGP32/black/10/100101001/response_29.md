### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column value, considering indentations. The bug arises from how the function handles the case where the current column exceeds the specified column. In this situation, instead of correctly returning the consumed part of the prefix and the remaining part, the function sometimes misses the correct indentation level.

### Bug Locations
1. The condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:` is comparing the current column with the specified column. However, it should be comparing with the length of `current_line` to ensure that indentation levels are correctly aligned.
2. The return statement `return res, prefix[len(res):]` might not correctly calculate the remaining part of the prefix as the consumed part is not properly determined.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the case where the current column exceeds the specified column. This can be achieved by comparing the length of `current_line` with the specified column. Additionally, the calculation of the remaining prefix should be adjusted to ensure correct slicing.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if len(current_line) > column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making these adjustments, the corrected function should now handle the consumed prefix and remaining prefix strings accurately, ensuring correct alignment based on the specified column.
