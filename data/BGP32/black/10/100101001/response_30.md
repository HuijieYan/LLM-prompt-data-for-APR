The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to occur when the comment line includes leading whitespace before the actual comment text. The function incorrectly handles the computation of column positions and processing of new lines, leading to incorrect output when extracting the prefix.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic of how the function handles whitespace characters, tabs, and new lines. Specifically, we need to ensure that the column count is correctly updated based on the different types of characters encountered.

Here is a corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            current_line += char
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
        else:
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures that the column count is properly updated for different types of characters and handles the extraction of prefixes with comments correctly.
