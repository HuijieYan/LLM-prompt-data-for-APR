### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a given prefix based on a specified column value. The function maintains a state to track the progress of consuming the prefix.

### Issues:
1. The function fails to correctly handle the case where the current prefix ends in the middle of an indentation.
2. Inconsistencies in updating the `current_column` when encountering whitespaces like spaces and tabs.
3. Incorrect return value handling when a line ending condition is met.

### Bugs:
1. In Case 1, the function incorrectly returns an empty string as `res` instead of the consumed prefix. 
2. In Cases 2, 3, and 4, the function fails to update the `current_column` properly, leading to incorrect handling of indentation.
3. In Case 3, the function incorrectly appends the incomplete line to `lines`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the consumed prefix includes the last line when ending mid-line.
2. Update the `current_column` correctly for spaces and tabs.
3. Handle returning the consumed prefix and the remaining suffix properly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    return ''.join(lines) + current_line, prefix[len(''.join(lines) + current_line):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making these adjustments to how the consumed prefix and remaining suffix are handled, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests.
