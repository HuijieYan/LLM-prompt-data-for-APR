### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in how the indentation levels are being handled when consuming the prefix string. The function is intended to partially consume the prefix up to a certain column, but it fails to do so correctly because it does not handle the indentation levels properly. This results in incorrect behavior when encountering spaces, tabs, and newlines within the prefix string.

### Bug Location:
The main issue is with how the `current_column` is being updated and compared against the `column` parameter. The function does not accurately track the accumulated indentation level, leading to premature consumption of the prefix string.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the function correctly keeps track of the total indentation level while iterating over the prefix characters. This means handling spaces, tabs, and newlines correctly, updating the `current_column` based on the encountered characters, and correctly determining when to stop consuming the prefix string.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_line += '\n'
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the function with the corrected version provided above, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now handle the prefix string correctly and pass the failing test cases.
