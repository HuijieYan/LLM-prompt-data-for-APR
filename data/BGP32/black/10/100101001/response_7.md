### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs because the condition to check if the `current_line` is empty or the `current_column` has reached the specified `column` value is incorrect. The function is returning prematurely before properly handling the indentation within the prefix.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition that checks if we should return the accumulated lines. We should check this condition after consuming all characters in the prefix and then return the accumulated lines.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_line += char
                wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making these changes, the function should now properly handle the prefix's indentation and return the expected result, hence passing the failing tests.
