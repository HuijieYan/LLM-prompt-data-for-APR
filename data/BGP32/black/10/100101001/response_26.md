The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is caused by lines being incorrectly added to the `lines` list when a newline character is encountered. This leads to incorrect handling of indentation and results in the function failing the test.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic in the function to correctly handle the addition of lines when encountering a newline character.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                continue
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected code addresses the issue by properly handling the addition of lines when encountering a newline character. The function should now pass the failing test.
