### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition for checking if the current column is less than the specified column might not be correctly implemented.
2. The logic for handling indentation with spaces and tabs might have issues.
3. The handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag might not be effective in some cases.

### Bug Explanation:
Based on the provided runtime values, it seems like the function is not correctly determining when to stop consuming the prefix based on the specified column value. This leads to incorrect behavior when handling indentation and line breaks in the prefix string, resulting in the function not partially consuming the prefix as expected. This can be observed in cases where the indentation in the prefix is not aligned with the specified column.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly tracks the current column position and stops consuming the prefix when it reaches the specified column. Additionally, the logic for handling spaces, tabs, and line breaks should be refined to accurately determine when to stop consuming the prefix.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:  # Updated condition to include equal check
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            if current_column >= column:  # Updated logic to handle current column exceeding specified column
                return ''.join(lines), current_line
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By addressing the issues mentioned above in the corrected version of the function, the bug should be fixed, and the function should now correctly partially consume the prefix based on the specified column value.
