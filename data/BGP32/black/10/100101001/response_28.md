### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is incorrectly handling the logic to consume the prefix up to a certain column. The issue arises when the function encounters a newline character. Instead of resetting the `current_column` to 0, it should remain at the current count. This reset causes the function to strip the content incorrectly, leading to the failing test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic when encountering a newline character. Instead of resetting `current_column` to 0, we should keep track of the current count to maintain the correct column position.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column += 1
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column += 1
            # handle newline by ignoring the reset of column count
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making this modification, the function should now correctly handle consuming the prefix up to the specified column count without incorrect resettings, addressing the issue and passing the failing test cases.
