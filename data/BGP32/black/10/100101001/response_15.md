### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is that when `wait_for_nl` is set to True and a '\n' character is encountered, it should check if the current line is non-empty and the current column is less than the specified column. If both conditions are met, it should return the partially consumed prefix. However, the current logic is incorrect and does not handle this scenario properly.

### Bug Location
The issue lies in the if condition that checks for the '\n' character when `wait_for_nl` is True. The condition to check if the current line is non-empty and the current column is less than the specified column is not correctly implemented.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic inside the if condition where the '\n' character is encountered while `wait_for_nl` is True. We should check if the current line is non-empty and if the current column is less than the specified column before returning the partially consumed prefix.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By making this correction, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now accurately handle the scenario where the current line is non-empty and the current column is less than the specified column when encountering a '\n' character while waiting for a newline. This fix should address the bug reported in the failing test cases.
