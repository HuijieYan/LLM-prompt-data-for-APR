### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column value. It processes characters until reaching the desired column and stops, returning the consumed characters and the remaining prefix.

#### Bugs:
1. The condition to check if the current line is not empty and the current column is less than the desired column is incorrect, causing incorrect consumption.
2. In some cases, there is a delay in consuming the prefix properly due to incorrect handling of characters.
3. In scenarios where the prefix does not end with a newline character, the function may not fully process the last line.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Correct the condition to check for the correct column and non-empty line before consuming.
2. Adjust character processing logic for accurate consumption.
3. Ensure proper handling when the prefix ends without a newline character.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the conditions for correct column comparison and improving the character processing logic, the corrected version of the function should now handle prefix consumption accurately and pass the failing tests.
