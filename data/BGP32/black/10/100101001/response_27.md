### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` might not be handling the indentation level check correctly.
2. The logic within the `if wait_for_nl` block and the else block might not be correctly updating the variables and forming the desired output. 
3. The handling of different characters like space, tab, and newline might be causing issues in tracking the current column count accurately.

### Bug Explanation:
The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is used to consume a prefix string up to a given column by tracking the current column count based on spaces, tabs, and newlines. However, the handling of cases where there is a comment at the end of the prefix might not be working properly, leading to incorrect output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly consumes the prefix up to the specified column, keeping track of indentation levels accurately. The condition for checking the current column count should be revised to handle various scenarios accurately.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.expandtabs().lstrip().startswith("#"):  # Adjusted condition for handling comments
                    lines.append(current_line)
                if current_column >= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Changed to 4 to handle tab's indentation level
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the condition for handling comments and updating the logic for current column count and line formation, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
