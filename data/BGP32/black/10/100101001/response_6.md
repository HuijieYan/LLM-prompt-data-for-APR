### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a given prefix until a specified column width is reached. It appends characters to `current_line` until reaching the specified width, then waits for a newline character to determine if the current line should be added to `lines` list and initialize a new line.

#### Issue:
The issue arises because when the condition `if char == '\n':` is met, the function immediately resets `current_column` to 0 instead of considering whether the newline character should increment the column count.

#### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic related to newline characters to correctly update the `current_column` according to the previous characters in the current line.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                if char != ' ' and char != '\t':
                    wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by properly handling the newline character condition and the logic related to waiting for a newline.
