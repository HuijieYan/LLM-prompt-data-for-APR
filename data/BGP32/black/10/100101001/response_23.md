### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string up to a certain column value, considering indentation. The function tracks the current line, column, and whether it needs to wait for a new line based on the input prefix.

### Issues:
1. The function is not correctly handling scenarios where the prefix contains whitespace characters such as tabs or spaces.
2. The logic to handle different characters (' ', '\t', '\n') is not accurately capturing the intended behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises because the function fails to skip over whitespace characters (' ' and '\t') while counting columns. This leads to incorrect tracking of the current position within the input prefix.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the columns are counted based on different characters encountered in the input prefix. Additionally, we need to correctly handle whitespace characters to ensure accurate tracking of the current position within the prefix.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if prefix.strip() != current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By incorporating the corrected logic to handle different characters and adjusting column counting for whitespace characters, the function should now correctly consume the prefix up to the specified column value.
