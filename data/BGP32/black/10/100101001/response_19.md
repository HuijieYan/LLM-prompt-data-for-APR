## Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume part of a prefix until a specific column is reached, handling indentation, tabs, spaces, and newlines. The bug resides in how the function handles the case when a newline character is encountered.

### Issue:
1. The condition to reset `current_column` to `0` when encountering a newline character is causing an unintended behavior, where the function prematurely considers a newline as an indicator to break the line.
2. This behavior breaks the correct handling of prefixes with comments that span across multiple lines, failing to reach the desired column limit.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function needs to retain the newline characters within the line being constructed until the desired column is reached. This involves modifying how the function handles newlines and ensuring that the complete line with comments is properly extracted.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            # indent is finished
            if current_column >= column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying these corrections, retest the failing test cases, especially those involving comments spanning multiple lines, to ensure the function works as expected.
