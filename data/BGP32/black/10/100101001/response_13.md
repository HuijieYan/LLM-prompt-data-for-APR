The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function stems from the logic around handling trailing comments and indentation. The function is incorrectly returning the prefix after consuming the entire prefix if it encounters an empty line or the comment starts before the specified column.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic to correctly handle indentation and comments while making sure to consume the correct prefix. We can modify the condition that checks if the comment is within the specified column before returning the consumed prefix. 

Here is a corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines + [current_line])
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures that the comment is within the specified column before returning the consumed prefix. This should address the issue with failing tests related to comment indentation.
