### 3. Explanation of the Bug
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is caused by the condition to check if an indentation is finished. When the function encounters a non-space character that is not a newline, it sets `wait_for_nl` to `True` to indicate that it is waiting for a newline character to determine if the current line's indentation is finished. However, in the case where there is a comment following the indentation without a newline character in between, the function fails to correctly identify the end of the indentation.

### 4. Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic in the function to handle cases where there is a comment immediately after the indentation without a newline character interrupting the indentation. In such cases, we need to expand the logic to correctly identify the end of the indentation before the comment.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':
            # ignore comments until a newline is encountered
            current_line = current_line.rstrip()
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines) + current_line, ""
```

### Explanation of the Correction
In the corrected version of the function, an additional condition is added to handle cases where a comment immediately follows an indentation without a newline character. When a `#` character is encountered, it trims the current line to remove any trailing spaces and sets `wait_for_nl` to `True`, indicating that we are waiting for a newline character before considering the indentation finished. This adjustment allows the function to correctly handle cases where comments are present after the indentation without a newline character in between.
