### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is due to incorrectly handling the case where the comment starts without any space or tab indentation (e.g., `'# comment\n'`). The function fails to correctly handle this situation, leading to incorrect results and failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to update the logic to correctly handle comments without any leading spaces or tabs. We should check for this case and include the comment in the result when necessary.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            if char != '#' and wait_for_nl:
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == '#':
                wait_for_nl = True
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
``` 

By adding the `elif char == '#'` condition and setting `wait_for_nl = True`, we ensure that comments without preceding spaces or tabs are correctly handled. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
