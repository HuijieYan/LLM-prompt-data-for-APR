The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string up to a specified column while handling indentation correctly. The function has a bug where it fails to correctly handle the cases where there is a comment at the end of the line.

The bug occurs because when encountering a comment character (`#`), the function does not update the `current_column` counter and incorrectly sets `wait_for_nl` to `True`. This leads to incorrect handling of the prefix string, resulting in a wrong output.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when a comment character is encountered, it updates the `current_column` counter accordingly and does not set `wait_for_nl` to `True`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '#':  # updated to handle comments
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version addresses the issue with handling comments and should now pass the failing test provided.
