### Bug Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a given prefix based on a specified column.
- The issue arises when the function encounters a newline character (`'\n'`) where it fails to correctly handle the indentation logic.
- The `wait_for_nl` flag is not set back to `False` after encountering a newline character, causing incorrect handling of subsequent characters in the prefix.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to ensure that the `wait_for_nl` flag is properly reset to `False` whenever a newline character is encountered. This will ensure that the function correctly identifies and handles subsequent characters based on the specified column.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else 4 if char == '\t' else 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By resetting the `wait_for_nl` flag to `False` when encountering a newline character and adjusting the indentation logic within the loop, the corrected version of the function should now handle the prefix consumption correctly.
