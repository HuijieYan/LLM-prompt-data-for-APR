### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume part of a given prefix until a specific column is reached. However, based on the failing test cases, it fails to handle cases where a comment appears before the expected column. This results in incorrect output and consequently failing tests.

### Bug:
The bug lies in the condition to check for the expected column when encountering a line break (`char == '\n'`). The function incorrectly assumes that an empty line break indicates that the expected column has been reached, leading to premature slicing of the prefix.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, the logic for handling line breaks should be adjusted to properly track the position in the prefix until the expected column is reached. This can be achieved by updating the condition for handling line breaks (`char == '\n'`) to reset the tracking variables (`current_line`, `current_column`, `wait_for_nl`) instead of prematurely returning the result.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:  # Reset tracking variables
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By incorporating the suggested fix, the function now correctly handles cases where comments appear before the expected column. This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases.
