The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be related to how it handles the `wait_for_nl` flag and the logic for consuming prefixes based on indentation levels.

After analyzing the provided runtime values and types, it is clear that the function incorrectly handles the case when encountering a newline character (`\n`) in the prefix while waiting for a newline. This causes issues with tracking the current column and building the lines correctly.

To fix this bug, we should update the logic around handling newline characters and resetting the state when encountering them. One approach is to reset the `current_line` and `current_column` when a newline character is encountered, regardless of the `wait_for_nl` flag, as the indentation level should reset at each new line.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should properly handle newline characters and reset the state when encountering them, ensuring the correct consumption of prefixes based on indentation levels. This fix should address the bug and make the function pass the failing test cases.
