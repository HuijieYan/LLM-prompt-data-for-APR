### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs because the logic to handle indentation levels and correctly counting columns is not functioning as intended. The function is designed to consume a prefix string up to a certain column number while handling different types of indentation such as spaces, tabs, and newlines. However, the current implementation fails to accurately track the indentation levels and does not properly handle cases where comments are involved or the column count is exceeded.

### Bug Location:
The issues in the function stem from the handling of indentation characters (\t, ' ') and newlines (\n) in relation to column counting and line building. In particular, the logic for determining when to stop consuming the prefix is flawed, causing incorrect results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to revisit the logic for handling indentation levels, counting columns accurately, and correctly stopping the consumption of the prefix based on the specified column number. Additionally, special attention should be given to cases where comments or newlines are present as they can affect the correct behavior of the function.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is a corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function that addresses the issues described above:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if current_column >= column:
            break
        
        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        else:
            current_line += char

    if current_column < column and current_line.strip():
        lines.append(current_line)
    
    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
```

By making these improvements in line tracking, indentation handling, and determining when to stop consuming the prefix, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
