The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is due to the incorrect handling of the newline character (`\n`) and the indentation levels. The function is supposed to consume characters from the prefix until a newline character is encountered and then check if the current line's indentation level is less than the specified column.

Here is a fixed version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adding an additional check for the indentation level when encountering a newline character, the function will correctly handle cases where the current line's indentation level is less than the specified column.

This fixed version should pass the failing test provided.
