### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs when encountering comments after dedented code blocks due to incorrect handling of indentation. The function does not appropriately track the relevant parameters to maintain correct column alignment, leading to misaligned comments and inconsistent indentation.

#### Observations:
1. The function incorrectly updates `current_column` regardless of the character encountered.
2. The condition to handle comment indentation (`wait_for_nl = True`) is not reset properly.
3. In cases of empty lines (`char == '\n'`), the column should reset, but it doesn't behave as expected.
4. The logic to return the partially consumed prefix is flawed, resulting in incorrect behavior during comment processing.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the `current_column` based on the characters encountered to maintain accurate column alignment.
2. Correctly reset the `wait_for_nl` flag to handle comments after dedented code blocks.
3. Address the handling of empty lines to reset the column properly.
4. Refine the logic for returning the partially consumed prefix to ensure correct behavior during comment processing.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0  # Reset the column on encountering a newline
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True  # Set the flag to handle comment indentation
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After addressing the identified issues and aligning the function's behavior with the expected input/output, the corrected version should produce the desired outcomes for the failing tests and resolve the GitHub issue related to incorrect comment indentation.
