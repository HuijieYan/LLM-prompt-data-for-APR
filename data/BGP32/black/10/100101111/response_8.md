## Analysis
1. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to process a given prefix string based on the indentation level represented by the `column` parameter.
2. The bug seems to be related to handling whitespace characters (spaces and tabs) and newline characters incorrectly when determining indentation levels.
3. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` compares the output of the function for scenarios where comments in source code have different levels of indentation.
4. The bug leads to incorrect handling of indentation levels for comments, as reported in the GitHub issue.

## Bug Explanation
- In the provided cases, the function fails to correctly consume and differentiate between spaces, tabs, and newlines while tracking the indentation level.
- The `wait_for_nl` flag is not being set/reset appropriately, leading to incorrect identification of the start of a new line or the completion of an indent block.
- This leads to mismatched indentation levels for comments, causing the failing test scenarios.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure proper handling of whitespace characters (spaces, tabs) and newlines to calculate the correct indentation level.
2. Reset the `wait_for_nl` flag when encountering a newline character to track each line's indentation independently.
3. Adjust the logic to correctly identify the end of an indentation block.
4. Consider the expectation from the failing test cases to align the function's behavior with the intended fix.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic to correctly handle whitespace characters and newline characters, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and address the reported issue on GitHub related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
