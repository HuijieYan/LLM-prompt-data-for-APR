### Analysis:
- The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is supposed to process a string `prefix` by consuming a part of it up to a certain column value. However, in some cases, it fails to handle newlines and maintain the correct column positioning.
- The failing test `test_comment_indentation` aims to check the correct behavior of the function when dealing with comment indentation after dedent operations.
- The function relies on tracking the current line, column, and handling different character types like space, tabs, and newlines to correctly extract the prefix up to a specified column value.
- The provided runtime input/output values show discrepancies in maintaining the correct column count and handling newline characters in the output.

### Bug Cause:
- The function fails to reset the `current_column` value to `0` when encountering a newline character, leading to incorrect counting of columns across different lines.
- Additionally, the logic to handle waiting for a newline needs adjustment to correctly process new lines and maintain the correct column count.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Reset `current_column` to `0` when a newline character is encountered.
2. Adjust the logic for handling newlines to reset the state properly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip():
                    if current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    else:
                        lines.append(current_line)
                        current_line = ""
                        current_column = 0
                        wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By resetting the `current_column` value to `0` when encountering a newline and adjusting the logic for handling newline characters, the corrected version of the function should now correctly process the prefix up to the specified column value, as expected.
