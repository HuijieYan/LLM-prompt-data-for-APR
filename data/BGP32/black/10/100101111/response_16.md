### Analysis:
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to process a prefix by partially consuming it until a certain column is reached. However, there are issues with handling tab characters and calculating the correct indentation level.
2. The bug seems to be related to incorrect tab character handling that leads to the incorrect column detection.
3. For example, in Case 1 the function fails to correctly identify the indentation level due to the incorrect handling of tabs.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that tab characters are correctly processed to adjust the column level accordingly.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assume tab width of 4 spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
        
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By ensuring that tab characters are appropriately processed to adjust the column level, the corrected function should now properly handle the input prefixes and produce the expected output, fixing the bug identified in the failing test cases.
