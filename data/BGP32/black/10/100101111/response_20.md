### Analysis:
The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is meant to partially consume a prefix of a given string based on a column number. The bug seems to occur when the function encounters tabs and spaces in the input string, causing incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent.

### Bug:
The bug arises due to incorrect handling of the character `'\t'` in the input prefix. The current implementation treats each tab as a single character when increasing the `current_column` count, leading to improper column tracking and incorrect indentation.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle tab characters and increment the `current_column` by 4 for each tab character encountered. Additionally, when encountering a newline character after a dedent, we should align the comment indentation correctly.

### Updated Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the handling of the tab character, the corrected function should now correctly handle the indentation and align comments after a dedent as per the expected behavior.
