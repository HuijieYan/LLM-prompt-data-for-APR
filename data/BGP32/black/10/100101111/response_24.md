### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function where the indentation for comments after a dedent is incorrectly handled. The function fails to maintain the correct indentation for comments in cases where the code indentation changes due to tabs or spaces.

### Bug Location:
The bug is likely caused by the logic handling the indentation levels and newlines in the input prefix string. The function fails to properly track and adjust the indentation levels when encountering different characters like spaces, tabs, or newlines.

### Bug Cause:
In the failing test case provided, the function fails to correctly handle the indentation for comments after a dedent due to the logic of tracking column positions and waiting for new lines. This results in the incorrect indentation of comments compared to the rest of the code.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to properly handle the indentation levels when encountering spaces, tabs, and new lines. It should ensure that comments maintain the same level of indentation as the surrounding code, especially after a dedent.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # maintain the correct comment indentation
            if '#' in current_line and current_column < column:
                current_line = current_line.lstrip()
            current_column = 0
        else:
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

        lines.append(current_line)
        current_line = ""
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic within the function to handle comment indentation correctly and adjust the column positions accordingly, we can ensure that comments maintain the same level of indentation as the rest of the code. This correction should address the bug and make the function behave as expected in the failing test cases.
