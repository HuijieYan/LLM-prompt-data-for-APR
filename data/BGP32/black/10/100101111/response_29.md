### Analysis:
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to process a prefix string and partially consume it based on a specific column value.
2. The function maintains variables like `lines`, `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl` to keep track of the progress.
3. The bug is likely related to incorrect handling of the indentation when encounters a comment after dedent.
4. The expected behavior is to preserve the original comment indentation after a dedent operation.
5. The failing test case focuses on comment indentation and is triggered by an incorrect behavior of the function.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs when the function encounters a comment after dedent.
- It fails to maintain the correct comment indentation, leading to incorrect formatting.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Adjust the logic within the function to correctly handle comment indentation post dedent operations.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip():
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if not current_line.isspace():
                lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Conclusion:
The corrected function ensures that comment indentation is preserved correctly after a dedent operation, addressing the issue reported on GitHub related to incorrect indentation for comments with tabs.
