### Analysis:
1. The function `_partially_consume_prefix()` is intended to partially consume a prefix string and maintain the correct indentation.
2. The bug seems to occur when dealing with tabs, especially after dedenting. The incorrect indentation leads to failing test cases.
3. The function wrongly sets `current_column` to 4 after encountering a tab character, causing issues when processing the next characters.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic related to tabs and ensure that the correct column is tracked.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of tab characters in the `_partially_consume_prefix()` function. After encountering a tab, the function incorrectly increments `current_column` by 4, causing incorrect indentation calculation.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic related to tabs and correctly update the `current_column` variable based on tab width (which is 8 characters). During the consumption of tabs, the indentation level needs to be correctly tracked.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 8  # Tab width is 8 characters
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the tab increment to `current_column += 8`, the corrected function can now properly handle tabs and maintain correct indentation levels as per the tab width defined.
