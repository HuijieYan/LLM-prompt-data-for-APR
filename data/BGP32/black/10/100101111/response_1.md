### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is due to the incorrect handling of the character `\n` when encountered in the prefix string. The function erroneously resets the `current_column` to 0 when it should maintain the current indentation level. This causes the wrong calculation of the remaining prefix required to consume.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this issue, we need to ensure that when encountering a newline character `\n`, the function correctly maintains the current indentation level. We should only reset `current_column` to 0 if a non-empty line is encountered after a newline. Additionally, we should handle the case where multiple newline characters are present.

### Corrected Version of the Function
After analyzing the bug and the cases provided, here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should properly handle the indentation levels for different cases as outlined.
