### Error Identification and Explanation:
The issue in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the incorrect handling of tab characters when calculating the current column number. The function wrongly increments the `current_column` by 4 for each tab character encountered, which leads to incorrect tracking of the column position, especially in the case of tabulated comments. This incorrect tracking causes the indentation for comments after a dedent to be altered by the function, resulting in a failed test case.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To resolve this issue and correct the function, we need to adjust the way tab characters are handled while calculating the column position. Instead of incrementing the column by a fixed amount for each tab character, we should calculate it based on the actual tab size. In Python, the tab size is typically considered to be 8 characters wide.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    tab_size = 8  # Tab size is assumed to be 8 characters wide
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += tab_size - (current_column % tab_size)  # Adjust the column position based on tab size
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected function adjusts the way tab characters are processed by considering the tab size and accurately calculating the column position. This modification should address the issue reported in the GitHub post and make the function behave correctly when dealing with tabulated comments after a dedent.
