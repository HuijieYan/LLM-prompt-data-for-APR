### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix string until a certain column width is reached based on spaces and tabs. The function is intended to handle cases where indentation occurs with spaces and tabs, maintaining the correct column position for the subsequent content.

The bug seems to be centered around the logic where the function tracks spaces, tabs, and newlines to calculate the indentation level (column). The issue arises when a comment is encountered after dedenting, as the function fails to adjust the comment indentation according to the previous content.

### Bug Identification
1. The function does not correctly handle the case where a comment is encountered after a dedent, resulting in incorrect comment indentation.
2. The `wait_for_nl` flag is set when an indent is finished, but the logic for adjusting the comment indentation after dedenting is missing.

### Bug Explanation
In the failing test `test_comment_indentation`, as seen from the runtime values and types provided:
- Case 1:
   - The function incorrectly retains the original comment indentation when a dedent occurs, leading to misaligned comment.
- Case 3:
   - The function fails to adjust the comment indentation correctly in the presence of tabs and spaces, leading to incorrect output.

These cases highlight the bug where comments are not properly aligned after dedenting, causing the test failures and aligning with the reported GitHub issue related to incorrect comment indentation handling.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To rectify the bug:
1. Adjust the logic to properly handle comment indentation after a dedent to maintain alignment correctly.
2. Ensure that comments respect the indentation level of the code block they are a part of.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    allow_adjust_indent = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
            allow_adjust_indent = True
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            wait_for_nl = True
            allow_adjust_indent = False
            current_column = 0
        else:
            if allow_adjust_indent:
                adjust_indent = min(current_column, column)
                current_line += ' ' * adjust_indent
                current_column = max(current_column - adjust_indent, 0)
            wait_for_nl = True

        current_line += char
        
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By incorporating the `allow_adjust_indent` flag and adjusting the comment indentation within the function, the corrected code aims to handle comments properly after dedenting, ensuring the expected behavior and alignment.
