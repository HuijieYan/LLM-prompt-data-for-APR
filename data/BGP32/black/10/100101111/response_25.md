### Analysis:
- The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume part of a prefix string based on indentation levels and a specified column.
- The bug seems to be related to how the function processes indentation levels and handles waiting for a newline character.
- The primary issue appears to be in the logic for properly consuming the prefix string.
- The failing test `test_comment_indentation` aims to verify correct handling of comments' indentation after a dedent operation.
- The function needs to correctly determine when to consume characters and when to wait for a newline before proceeding.

### Bug Cause:
- In the current implementation, the function fails to handle indentation levels correctly after a dedent operation.
- When encountering whitespace characters, the function incorrectly increases the current column count without properly checking for newlines or the specified column.
- This behavior leads to misalignment when processing comments after a dedent.
- The incorrect handling of tabulation (4 spaces) further complicates the accurate interpretation of indentation levels.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Adjust the logic to correctly identify the start of a new indentation level and properly handle newline characters for accurate prefix consumption.
- Ensure that the function properly respects the existing indentation levels after dedent operations to maintain comment alignment.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False

        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the logic in the corrected version to handle tabs correctly and to manage newline characters and indentation levels more accurately, the function should now properly consume prefixes and maintain correct indentations for comments following dedent operations.
