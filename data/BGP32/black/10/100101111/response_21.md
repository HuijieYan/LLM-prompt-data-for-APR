### Bug Analysis:
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to partially consume the given `prefix` string until a certain `column` limit is reached based on indentation.
2. The bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of indentation levels, especially after dedent operations when encountering comments.
3. The identified error locations could be in the logic around handling tab and space characters, tracking columns, and managing new lines after dedent.
4. The failing test case `test_comment_indentation` aims to compare the behavior of `fs` function with different indentation styles, revealing the bug in handling comment indentation.
5. The GitHub issue also confirms the issue with incorrect comment indentation using tabs on dedent operations.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy logic fails to maintain the correct level of indentation for comments after a dedent operation, especially when transitioning from tabs to spaces. This results in incorrect comment alignment based on the input.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Improve the logic for tracking indentation levels, especially after dedent operations.
2. Ensure proper handling of tab and space characters to maintain consistent column counts.
3. Address the identification of comments during indentation processing to align them correctly.
4. Verify that the function handles both tab and space indentation consistently.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for pos, char in enumerate(prefix):
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[pos:]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the function to correctly handle the dynamic indentation with tabs and spaces, the corrected version should now pass the failing test case and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
