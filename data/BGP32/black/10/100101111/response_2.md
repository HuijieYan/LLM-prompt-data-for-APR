### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from incorrect handling of indentation levels for comments when encountering either tabs or spaces within the input prefix string. The function's logic does not properly account for the indentation of comments after a dedent operation, leading to incorrectly formatted output.

In the failing test `test_comment_indentation`, the function fails to correctly preserve the indentation of comments at the expected level after a dedent step. This failure occurs due to the function incorrectly handling the spacing and tab characters in the input prefix, causing incorrect column calculations and line constructions.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` needs to be modified to correctly adjust the indentation levels when encountering various indentation characters (spaces, tabs) and newline characters within the prefix string. The function should ensure that comments retain their original relative indentation level after dedent operations.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function adjusts the column calculations for spaces, tabs, and newlines appropriately, ensuring that comments are correctly aligned relative to the specified column value. This modification addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue and should now correctly handle comment indentation after dedent operations.
