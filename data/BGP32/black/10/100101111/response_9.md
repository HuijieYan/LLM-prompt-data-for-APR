### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to handle cases where code comments are present with a certain indentation level. However, based on the failing test `test_comment_indentation`, the function fails to correctly handle comments with tab characters and maintains the indentation level when handling dedent situations.

From the runtime values provided, it can be observed that the function fails to maintain the correct indentation level for comments after a dedent action. This leads to a discrepancy between the expected and actual values of variables, such as `current_column` and `current_line`.

### Bug Explanation:
The primary issue in the current implementation is related to how the function handles tab characters (`\t`) when calculating the current column. When encountering a tab character, the function incorrectly increments the `current_column` by 4, assuming a fixed tab width, which causes inconsistencies in maintaining the correct comment indentation.

Additionally, the function fails to correctly handle the situation of comments being at the same level as the code or being one level indented. This behavior results in incorrect output for comments.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, the following steps can be taken:
1. Adjust the handling of tab characters to correctly calculate the `current_column` based on the existing indentation level.
2. Properly evaluate the position and indentation of comments in relation to the code to maintain the correct formatting.
3. Check and ensure that the current column is appropriately updated after processing each character from the prefix.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == '\t':
            # Calculate the appropriate tab width dynamically based on the current indentation level
            tab_width = column - current_column % column if column > 0 else 1
            current_column += tab_width
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            # Unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # Indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adapting the tab width calculation based on the existing indentation level and ensuring proper handling of comment indentation, the corrected version of the function should address the bug and align with the expected input/output values.
