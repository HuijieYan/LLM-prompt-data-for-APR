**Analyzing the buggy function:**

The `_partially_consume_prefix` function aims to consume a portion of the input `prefix` string until a certain `column` value is reached or specific characters indicate a change in indentation. However, the current implementation of the function contains a bug that leads to incorrect behavior as described in the failing test case related to tabulated comments.

**Identified issue in the buggy function:**

The issue arises from the condition that checks for a newline character (`char == '\n'`) to handle indentation changes, as it does not correctly account for the cases involving tab characters (`\t`). This causes the function to misinterpret the tabulated comment indentation levels, leading to incorrect output.

**Strategy for fixing the bug:**

To resolve the bug, the function needs to handle tab characters (`\t`) appropriately and adjust the logic for tracking the current indentation level to ensure proper behavior when consuming the prefix string.

**Corrected version of the function:**

Here is the corrected version of `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version takes into account the tab character (`\t`) for indentation and adjusts the current column count accordingly to handle tabulated comments correctly after a dedent. This should fix the bug reported in the failing test related to incorrect comment indentation.
