### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for consuming the prefix of a string until a certain column position is reached. However, the function is not handling tab characters ('\t') correctly when calculating the current column position. This leads to incorrect calculations and the function failing to properly adjust the indentation level for comments.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of tab characters in the calculation of the current column position. The function increments `current_column` by 4 for each tab character encountered, which is inconsistent with tab characters' actual visual width. This discrepancy causes misalignment and incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent operation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function should handle tab characters appropriately by counting each tab as equivalent to the next multiple of 8 for the column position. This adjustment addresses the inconsistency in column width calculations and ensures proper indentation for comments after dedent operations.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            tab_width = 8 - (current_column % 8)
           current_column += tab_width
           current_line += ' ' * tab_width
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the handling of tab characters in the corrected version of the function, the bug related to incorrect comment indentation after a dedent should be resolved.
