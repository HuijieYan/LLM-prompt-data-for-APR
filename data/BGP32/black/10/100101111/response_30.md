### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix string, taking into account the required column indentation. However, the bug arises when encountering tabs in the prefix string. The current implementation misinterprets tab characters ('\t') for a single space (' '). This leads to incorrect calculation of `current_column`.

This issue results in incorrect handling of indentation for lines with tab characters, causing comments to be misaligned after dedent operations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the way tab characters are handled within the function. Instead of equating a tab character to a single space, we should correctly count the number of spaces that a tab represents within the context of the current column.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            spaces = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_line += ' ' * spaces
            current_column += spaces
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By correctly handling tab characters within the prefix string, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the reported issue on GitHub.
