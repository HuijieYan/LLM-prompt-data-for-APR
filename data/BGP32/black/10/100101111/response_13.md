### Bug Analysis:
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to consume a prefix string until a certain column position is reached. However, the issue lies in the condition where when encountering a newline character, it should check if the current line is non-empty and the current column is less than the specified column. If this condition is met, it should return the consumed text and the remaining prefix text correctly. The bug causes incorrect behavior when handling newline characters, leading to incorrect indentation.

### Bug Cause:
In the provided buggy function, the issue arises from the logic to handle newline characters. The `if char == '\n':` block does not properly check for non-empty current lines and the current column position, thus failing to correctly extract the partial text up to the specified column.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug:
1. Check and adjust the condition within the `if char == '\n':` block to validate the current line's content and the current column.
2. Ensure that the consumed text up to the specified column is correctly extracted and returned, preserving proper indentation.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version adjusts the condition for handling newline characters so that it correctly checks for non-empty lines and the specified column position before returning the consumed text.

By applying this fix, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now properly handle indentation for tabulated comments following a dedent, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
