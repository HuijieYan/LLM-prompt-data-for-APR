### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to handle the indentation and formatting of code prefixes. However, it fails to correctly handle the situation where comments are involved, resulting in incorrect indentation for comments after dedents.

1. Potential Error Locations:
    - The logic involving `wait_for_nl` and handling of different characters (`' '`, `'\t'`, `'\n'`) might be causing the incorrect behavior.
    - The decision to reset `current_column` and initiate `wait_for_nl` might be flawed, leading to incorrect handling of comments.

2. Cause of the Bug:
    When analyzing the runtime values and expected values provided, it is evident that the buggy function does not correctly handle the indentation for comments after dedentations, especially when a mixed usage of spaces and tabs is present. The function can get stuck waiting for a newline when encountering comments, leading to improper formatting.

3. Bug Fix Strategy:
    - Update the logic related to incrementing `current_column` and handling different characters to ensure proper indentation.
    - Make sure that comments are properly aligned with the preceding code, especially after dedents.
  
### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line += char
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line + char)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_line += char

            if not current_line.strip() and current_column >= column:
                wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the logic to correctly handle comments and indentation, the corrected version of the function should now properly align comments after dedents and ensure consistent formatting based on the given column parameter. This updated function should pass the failing test cases and meet the expected input/output values as indicated.
