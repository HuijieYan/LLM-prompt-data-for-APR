### Bug Explanation

The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the condition for handling tab characters. When encountering a tab character, the function incorrectly increments the `current_column` by 4 instead of incrementing by the length of the tab character (which is usually considered as 8 spaces). This discrepancy in counting tab characters leads to incorrect column calculations and consequently affects the correct processing of the input text.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic when encountering tab characters in the input text. Instead of incrementing `current_column` by 4, we should update it by the correct number of spaces equivalent to a tab character (usually 8 spaces). By aligning the column calculation correctly with tab characters, we can ensure the function behaves as expected and handles the indentation properly.

### Corrected Function

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 8  # Update column increment to handle tabs correctly
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making this adjustment to incrementing the `current_column` variable for tab characters, the function should now handle the input text correctly, addressing the bug and aligning with the expected behavior for the failing test cases.
