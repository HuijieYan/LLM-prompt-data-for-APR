### Error Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume part of the input prefix based on the column provided. However, the issue arises when dealing with tab characters since it miscalculates the column position.
2. The function fails to correctly handle indentations and waits until encountering a newline character to decide the consumed content, leading to incorrect behavior with tabulated inputs.
3. The chosen approach does not handle tab characters and results in inaccurate consumption and column tracking, causing misalignment with tabulated comments.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the function's flawed logic where tab characters are not accounted for accurately. The function wrongly operates based on the assumption that tab characters have the same indentation width as spaces, leading to misinterpreted column positions and incorrect content consumption.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To rectify the bug, the function must be updated to handle tab characters correctly. The fix involves adjusting the column tracking mechanism to consider tabs properly, ensuring that correct relative positions and content consumption are maintained.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))  # Adjust for tab width
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the tab handling logic within the function `_partially_consume_prefix`, the corrected version ensures accurate tracking of columns when dealing with tabulated inputs, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
