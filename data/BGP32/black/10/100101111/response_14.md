### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to handle indentation and tabs correctly, but it fails in scenarios where there are comments after dedents. The function incorrectly processes the indentation of comments, especially if they are at depth greater than 0 and after a dedent.

#### Issues in the given function:
1. The function does not properly deal with comments after dedents, which leads to incorrect indentation handling.

### Bug Cause:
The bug appears due to the incorrect handling of tabs and spaces when encountering comments after dedents. The function does not adjust the indentation of such comments properly, leading to incorrect results.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that comments after dedents are properly indented based on the existing code structure.
2. Properly handle tabs and spaces to maintain consistent indentation levels for comments regardless of their position.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    is_dedent = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                is_dedent = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            is_dedent = True
        else:
            if is_dedent and char == '#':
                current_column = column
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the function as shown above, the indentation for comments after dedents will be handled correctly, and the function should now pass the failing test case related to comment indentation issues.
