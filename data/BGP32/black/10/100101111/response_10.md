### Bug Explanation:

The bug occurs in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function where the logic to handle the indentation level for comments after a dedent is not working correctly. When there is a dedent and a comment following it, the comment should maintain the same level of indentation as the code after it. However, the current implementation in the function does not handle this scenario correctly, leading to incorrect indentation for comments.

In the failing test case for the `test_comment_indentation` function, the buggy behavior is evident when comparing the formatting of comments between tab and space indentation. The expected behavior is to align the comment indentation with the code following it after a dedent, which is not achieved due to the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To correct the bug, the logic within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function needs to be modified to ensure that comments maintain the correct indentation level after a dedent operation. Specifically, when a dedent is encountered followed by a comment, the function should adjust the comment indentation to match the code indentation level.

The fix involves updating the logic to handle the case where a dedent is followed by a comment and aligning the comment indentation correctly. By adjusting the logic in the function, the expected behavior for comment indentation after a dedent can be achieved.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # reset column count after newline
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # line content is not space or newline
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the bug and ensures that comments retain the correct indentation level after a dedent operation, as expected. The function now correctly handles the scenario where a dedent is followed by a comment, adjusting the comment indentation to align with the code following it.
