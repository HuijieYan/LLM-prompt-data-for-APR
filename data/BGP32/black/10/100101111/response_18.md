## Analysis
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is intended to handle the indentation of comments in a string. The issue seems to stem from the logic related to handling indentation levels and newline characters. The function fails to correctly handle the cases with tab characters, resulting in incorrect indentation of comments after a dedent.

### Bug Explanation
When the function encounters a newline character `\n` in the input string, it should check if the current line needs to be processed based on the column value. However, the logic is flawed, especially when dealing with tabs (`\t`). This issue leads to incorrect indentation processing for comments after a dedent, as observed in the failing test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic responsible for handling indentation levels and correctly identifying when to process the current line. Additionally, we should ensure that tab characters are accounted for when calculating the indentation column.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Adjust the column count for tabs
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version of the function, the column count has been adjusted by considering tabs as 4 characters in the `'\t'` case. This adjustment ensures that the function now correctly handles the indentation levels for tab characters, fixing the bug identified in the failing test cases.
