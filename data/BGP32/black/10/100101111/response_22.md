### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a part of the given prefix string based on specific conditions related to indentation. However, the function fails to handle tab characters correctly, leading to incorrect behavior in the output.

### Bug Cause:
The function fails because it treats tabs differently when calculating `current_column`, leading to incorrect behavior for input lines containing tabs. This inconsistency causes incorrect line breaking and preservation of tabulated comments.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic related to tab characters processing. Specifically, we should ensure that the tab characters are appropriately handled to reflect their actual contribution to the indentation level.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char in [' ', '\t']:
            pass
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version addresses the tab character handling issue and ensures consistent behavior for both tabs and spaces in terms of indentation calculation.
