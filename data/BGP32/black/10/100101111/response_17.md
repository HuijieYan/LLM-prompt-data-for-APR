### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, specifically when handling the indentation of comments. The function fails to correctly handle the indentation of comments when encountered after a dedent operation. This results in improper indentation of comments in the output, as seen in the failing test case related to comment indentation.

In each case detailed in the runtime values and types, the function fails to distinguish between the indentation level of the code and the indentation level required for comments. This leads to incorrect behavior in different scenarios, causing the test cases to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly differentiate between code indentation and comment indentation. The function should consider both the leading whitespace for code and any additional indentation required for the comment when processing the prefix. By adjusting the logic to account for this distinction, the function can correctly handle cases where comments follow dedent operations.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    comment_indent = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.lstrip().startswith("#") and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                comment_indent = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            comment_indent = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            if current_line.lstrip().startswith("#"):
                comment_indent = current_column

    return ''.join(lines), current_line if current_line.lstrip().startswith("#") else ""
``` 

By ensuring that the function correctly handles both code indentation and comment indentation, the corrected version should pass the failing test cases and address the issue described on GitHub related to incorrect comment indentation after a dedent operation.
