### Analysis:
1. The `assertFormatEqual` test function is failing due to the buggy `_partially_consume_prefix` function.
2. The bug is likely related to the incorrect handling of indentation levels in the case of comments. The function is not properly considering the column value when dealing with comments in the input text.
3. The failing test and error message indicate that the function fails to maintain correct indentation for comments after a dedent operation. The expected output for the failing test is not being met due to incorrect column processing.
4. To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the indentation of comments based on the provided column value. It should ensure that the comments are correctly aligned with the rest of the code after dedent operations.
5. A corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is provided below:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the handling of tabs and spaces to correctly calculate the column position, this corrected version of the function should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
