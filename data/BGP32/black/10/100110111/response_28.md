### Analysis
The `partially_consume_prefix` function is responsible for processing the prefix of a code snippet to determine the correct formatting based on the indentation level. The buggy behavior is causing incorrect handling of comments with tabs leading to incorrect indentation after dedent.

The failing test `test_comment_indentation` aims to validate how comments are correctly indented after dedent in both spaces and tabs indentation styles. The error message shows that the function is not producing the expected output for the `contents_tab` input, specifically related to comment indentation.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of whitespace characters, particularly tabs, when processing the prefix. When encountering tabs, the function is not appropriately updating the current column count and not indenting the comments correctly after a dedent operation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, it's necessary to ensure that the function properly handles tab characters and adjusts the current column count accordingly. This adjustment will ensure that comments are correctly indented based on the column value after dedent.

### Corrected Function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # Update column based on tab size
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
        
        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After making these corrections to handle tab characters appropriately, the function should be able to process the prefix correctly and ensure that comments are indented correctly after a dedent operation.
