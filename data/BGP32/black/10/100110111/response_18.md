### Bug Analysis:
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to consume a partial prefix string while handling indentation.
2. The error message indicates a mismatch in the indentation of a comment line in the test case.
3. The function incorrectly handles the indentation of comments after a dedent situation due to improper processing of indentation levels.
4. The strategy for fixing the bug involves ensuring consistent indentation handling for comment lines after dedents.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if not current_line.strip():
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The updated code snippet adds a check in case of a newline character to handle situations where there are empty lines or to continue processing the current_line.

After this correction, the function should be able to handle the indentation of comment lines correctly after dedent situations.
