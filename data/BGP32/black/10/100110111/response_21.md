### Bug Analysis:
- The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to handle indentation inside a string (`prefix`) based on the provided `column`. It keeps track of the current line, column, and waits for a new line character to adjust the indentation.
- The bug seems to stem from the logic when encountering a new line character (`\n`). The current implementation fails to handle indentation properly specifically after a dedent operation, resulting in incorrect indentation for comments after that.
- The failing test `test_comment_indentation` aims to verify that the function maintains correct indentation for comments.
- The error message shows that the function fails to produce the expected string with correct comment indentation in at least one of the test cases.

### Bug Explanation:
- In the failing test case, the comments are not indented correctly after a dedent operation.
- The function `_partially_consume_prefix` fails to handle the case where a new line character is encountered after a dedent.
- This leads to incorrect tracking of the current line and column, resulting in wrong indentation handling for comments.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Adjust the logic inside the function to ensure that after encountering a new line character, the function correctly adjusts the line and column tracking to maintain proper indentation.
- Specifically, after a dedent operation, the function should handle the following characters (like spaces or tabs) properly to align the comment correctly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char in [' ', '\t']:  # Handle spaces and tabs after dedent
                current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else 4
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the way the function handles indentation and new line characters, the corrected function should now maintain the correct indentation for comments, passing the failing test case and resolving the GitHub issue.
