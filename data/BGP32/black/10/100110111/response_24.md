### Fixing the Bug

- The bug is related to the handling of indentation when encountering comments after a dedent in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function.
- The function incorrectly handles tabbed indentation and causes mismatched comment indentation in the failing test.
- To resolve this issue, we need to adjust the handling of tabs, spaces, and new lines to maintain consistent indentation for comments.
- The strategy for fixing this bug involves carefully tracking the current indentation level, identation type (tabs or spaces), and adjusting the comment indentation based on these factors.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            if current_column < column:
                current_line += ' ' * (column - current_column)
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the adjustment for handling tabs in the function, we ensure that comment indentation is correctly maintained for the given input. This corrected version should effectively resolve the bug and pass the failing test case.
