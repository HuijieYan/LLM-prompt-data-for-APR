### Analysis:
1. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to process the prefix of a string until a certain column, considering different indentation characters and newline characters.
2. The error occurs when handling tab characters and processing the line for comments.
3. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` expects the comment lines to be properly aligned with the code after dedent, but due to the incorrect handling of tabs, the comments are misaligned.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles tab characters correctly and aligns the comments properly.
5. The GitHub issue raised highlights the mismatch in comment indentation after dedent when using tabs.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic related to tab characters to ensure correct column increment.
2. Adjust the handling of comments to maintain proper alignment with the preceding code.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)  # Adjust column for tab character
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the adjustments above, the function should now correctly handle the tab characters and maintain the correct alignment for comments after a dedent. This corrected version should pass the failing test and align with the expected input/output values.
