### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming a prefix, maintaining the necessary indentation level. The issue arises when dealing with tabs and spaces in the prefix, leading to incorrect handling of indentation for comments after dedents. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` highlights these problems when comparing expected and actual string outputs.

The error message indicates an `AssertionError` due to mismatched outputs for the `contents_tab` compared to the expected `contents_spc`. The problem arises from incorrect handling of whitespace characters (tabs or spaces) within the prefix string, specifically affecting comments.

### Bug Cause:
The bug stems from improper tracking of the current line, columns, and wait conditions within the loop of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. When encountering tabs or spaces, the function fails to adjust the indentation correctly after dedents.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the bug:
1. Correctly handle tab and space characters to update the current column's count appropriately.
2. Adjust the indentation level for comments after dedents to match the required spacing.
3. Ensure that the wait conditions for newline characters are applied correctly.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            # Adjust column count for spaces
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Adjust column count for tabs
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # Adjust the indentation for comments after dedent
            if current_column == 0 and current_line.strip().startswith('#'):
                current_line = ' ' * column + current_line.lstrip()
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

Applying these changes to properly handle indentation, spaces, tabs, and comments after dedents should correct the bug and align the function with the expected behavior.
