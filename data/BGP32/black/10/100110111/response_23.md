### Analysis:
1. The `partially_consume_prefix()` function seems to handle parsing indentation-related content in a prefix string of code.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` complains about incorrect handling of comments' indentation after a dedent in the case of tabulated code.
3. The function is not correctly managing the newline characters and indentation levels after a dedent operation, resulting in misaligned comments in the output.
4. To fix this issue, we need to adjust the logic concerning the newline and indentation tracking to correctly preserve the comment alignment after dedents operation.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function `_partially_consume_prefix` does not properly handle newline characters and the associated column counts after a dedent operation, leading to incorrect comment indentation alignment.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the newline characters and alignment of comments after a dedent. Adjusting the logic related to managing newline characters and indentation levels should resolve the issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip():  # Only add non-empty lines
                lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the adjustment to handle newline characters correctly and ensuring the alignment of comments after dedents, the corrected function should now pass the failing test case and align comments properly in the output.
