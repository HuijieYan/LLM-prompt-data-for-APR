### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` might not be correctly handling the indentation requirements.
2. The use of `lines` list might pose issues in accumulating the lines correctly based on the indentation levels.
3. `wait_for_nl` flag might not be toggled correctly in cases where there are multiple consecutive newlines.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of the indentation levels and newline characters. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` fails to properly accumulate the lines and identify the correct level of indentation when encountering comments after a dedent. This leads to incorrect formatting of the comments in the output.

### Fixing Strategy:
1. Ensure correct tracking of the current line being processed and its indentation level.
2. Adjust the flow to correctly handle cases with comments after dedents.
3. Update the conditions and flags to properly identify the indentation changes.
4. Incorporate checks to manage newlines and whitespace characters accurately.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            if current_column == 0:
                current_line = char
            else:
                current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column//4 + 1)*4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By incorporating these adjustments in the function, it should now correctly handle the indentation levels and newline characters, resolving the issue posted on GitHub and passing the failing test cases.
