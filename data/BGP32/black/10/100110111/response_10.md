### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string until a certain column value is reached, handling different types of characters like spaces, tabs, and new lines. The bug seems to be related to the handling of the prefix string and the calculation of indentation columns.

The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is specifically checking the behavior of the function when dealing with comments after dedentations, where the indentation should remain consistent. The error message indicates a mismatch in the output when tabs are replaced by spaces in the comments.

The expected input/output variable values provided for different cases indicate the correct behavior that the fixed function should exhibit.

### Bug Location:
The bug may be located in the logic that determines how to process characters in the prefix string, specifically the conditions related to handling tabs, spaces, and new lines. The incorrect indentation observed in the failing test suggests that there might be an issue with how tab characters are processed and accounted for.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be caused by incorrect handling of tab characters and the subsequent calculation of column positions in the prefix string. This leads to incorrect indentation, as observed in the failing test case.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that tab characters are handled properly in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to maintain consistent indentation levels, especially when dealing with comments after dedentations. This involves adjusting the logic related to tab character processing and column calculations.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Correct tab width to be consistent with spaces
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version improves the handling of tab characters by ensuring that the column position calculation for tabs is consistent with spaces. It also addresses the incorrect indentation bug observed in the failing test case.

By incorporating this corrected logic, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now pass the failing test case and maintain the expected input/output variable values, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
