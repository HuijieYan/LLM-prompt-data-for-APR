### Analysis:
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to process a prefix string, counting the indentation and ensuring proper indentation for comments.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` checks if the function correctly handles indentation for comments.
3. The error message indicates a mismatch between expected and actual strings, specifically related to comment indentation.
4. The function seems to incorrectly handle indentation levels for comments.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when the function does not correctly track the current column position and fails to adjust the comment indentation effectively, leading to a mismatch between expected and actual output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper handling of the current column position when encountering comment symbols ('#'). We should adjust the indentation level accordingly to maintain consistent formatting.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':
            current_column += (column - current_column)  # Adjust comment indentation
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the comment indentation based on the desired column position, the corrected function should now handle comment indentation correctly according to the specified column.
