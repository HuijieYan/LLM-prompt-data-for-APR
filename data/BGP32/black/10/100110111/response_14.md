### Analysis:
1. The `test_comment_indentation` test is checking if the `assertFormatEqual` method correctly handles the indentation of comments after dedent. The failing test case is due to the incorrect behavior of the `_partially_consume_prefix` method.
2. The bug occurs because the function does not correctly handle the scenario where a comment is in a line with reduced indentation. This results in an incorrect conversion of tabs to spaces for the comment.
  
### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `_partially_consume_prefix` method incorrectly handling the indentation level after encountering comments at a different depth.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the tracking of the current column count and waits for a new line after encountering an indentation change due to a comment.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column and current_line.strip():
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line

```

By adjusting the condition for handling newline characters and tracking the correct column count, the corrected function should now correctly handle the indentation changes after encountering comments. This will result in passing the failing test and resolve the reported issue on GitHub.
