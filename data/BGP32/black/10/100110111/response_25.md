### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix of text content up to a specific column. It processes the prefix character by character and handles different cases for whitespace characters and newlines.
2. The function has a logic issue where it incorrectly handles the scenario where a comment is encountered after an indent (space or tab) finishing. This results in the misalignment of comments in the output.
3. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` compares the expected indentation of comments in a scenario where the buggy function fails to handle tabulated comments after a dedent correctly.
4. To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly manage the transition from an indent to a comment, ensuring the comment aligns properly with the following code.

### Bug Explanation
- In the failing test, when processing a tabulated comment after an indent, the function fails to properly align the comment with the subsequent code. This results in incorrect indentation in the output.
- The error message highlights the misalignment of the comment compared to the expected output.
- The cause of the issue lies in the logic handling the transition from an indent to a comment. This transition is not correctly managed, leading to incorrect indentation alignment.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should be updated to correctly handle the scenario where a comment follows an indent. It needs to ensure that tabulated comments maintain the proper alignment with the subsequent code.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char.isspace():
            current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By incorporating the mentioned changes, the corrected `partially_consume_prefix` function should now handle tabulated comments correctly after indents, aligning them properly with the subsequent code.
