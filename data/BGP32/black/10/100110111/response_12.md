### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to handle indentation adjustments and newline characters in a given prefix string.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` compares the expected and actual formatted strings, and it fails due to incorrect handling of comments and indentation.
3. The bug causes incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent operation in the prefix string containing tabs.
4. The issue on GitHub highlights the problem with the incorrect indentation of comments after a dedent operation, specifically when tabs are used for indentation.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. When encountering a space or tab, the function increments the `current_column` value, which leads to incorrect indentation tracking and results in failing the test case for comments indentation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the `wait_for_nl` logic to ensure correct tracking of comments and indentation levels. We should update the logic related to `wait_for_nl` and indentation calculations to accurately handle comments indentation after a dedent operation.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic of handling newline characters and indentation, we ensure correct behavior when encountering comments and indentation adjustments. This corrected version should pass the failing test and address the reported issue on GitHub regarding incorrect comment indentation after a dedent operation with tabulated indentation.
