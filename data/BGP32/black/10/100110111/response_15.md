### Analyzing the buggy function and test code:

The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to process input text and determine part of it that belongs to a specific indentation level. The function tracks the current line, column, and handles whitespace characters such as space, tab, and newline. The issue arises when processing comments with inconsistent indentation levels.

The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is comparing the formatted code using spaces with the expected output but encounters an assertion error due to incorrect indentation handling in the function.

### Identified potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. Incorrect handling of indentations for comments following a dedent operation.
2. Inconsistencies in updating `current_line` and `current_column`.

### Explanation of the bug:
The bug occurs when the function encounters a comment after a dedent operation. It fails to maintain the correct indentation level for the comment, leading to incorrect formatting in the output. The function's logic for tracking current line and column positions is flawed when dealing with comments and whitespace characters.

The failing test specifically highlights the issue when a comment is not aligned correctly with its context due to incorrect indentation handling.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` needs to correctly handle comments and maintain proper indentation alignment after dedent operations. This involves adjusting the logic for tracking current line and column positions relative to comments and implementing a fix for processing comments following dedents.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                if current_line.strip().startswith('#'):
                    lines.append(current_line)
                else:
                    lines.append(current_line.lstrip())
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if not current_line.strip().startswith('#'):
                lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    if current_line.strip():
        if current_line.strip().startswith('#'):
            lines.append(current_line)
        else:
            lines.append(current_line.lstrip())
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This correction includes:
- Proper handling of comments to maintain their original indentation level.
- Adjustment in the logic to correctly process comments and whitespace characters.
- Ensuring preservation of the correct indentation alignment particularly after dedents.

With these changes, the corrected function should align comments correctly with their corresponding code blocks, resolving the indentation issue highlighted in the failing test.
