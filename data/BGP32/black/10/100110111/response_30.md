### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to process a prefix string like "\t\t# comment\n\t" based on the column parameter. It manages the indentation levels and extracts lines correctly.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` compares the output of the function for different types of indentation in Python code. It fails for tabulated indentation due to incorrect processing of comment indentation.
3. The error occurs when the comment indentation does not match the expected output. This is caused by issues in handling tabulated indentation and comment alignment.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure correct positioning of comments according to the indentation level. This involves adjusting the logic related to tabulation and comment handling in the function.
5. We will provide a corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to address the tabulated comment indentation issue.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                if '#' in current_line:
                    current_line = current_line.lstrip()  # Adjust comment indentation
                    
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 8  # Change tab size for consistent indentation logic
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version adjusts the comment's indentation level by removing leading whitespace for comments. It also standardizes the tab size to 8 characters for consistent indentation logic between spaces and tabs. These changes should resolve the comment indentation issues observed in the failing test and reported GitHub issue.
