### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has a bug related to handling indentation levels for comments. The issue arises when there is an empty line right after a block of code with a comment. In that scenario, the buggy function fails to preserve the correct indentation level for the comment based on the preceding code block.

### Bug Location
The bug occurs in the section of the code where the function checks for an empty line after encountering a newline character. This logic is responsible for resetting the `current_column` variable to zero, losing track of the actual indentation level.

### Bug Cause
The root cause of the bug is the improper handling of empty lines after a comment block. The `current_column` variable is reset to zero without considering the indentation level necessary for the following code. This causes incorrect indentation alignment for comments.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should update the logic in the `elif char == '\n'` block to maintain the correct `current_column` value after encountering an empty line. This adjustment will ensure that the function preserves the correct indentation level for comments, especially after a block of code.

### Corrected Function
Based on the above analysis and fix strategy, here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                if current_line.strip():
                    lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if not wait_for_nl:
                lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making this adjustment in the corrected version of the function, the bug related to incorrect comment indentation alignment should be resolved, and the function should pass the failing test case.
