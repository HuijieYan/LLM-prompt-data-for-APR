## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is meant to consume part of the prefix string until a certain column is reached, handling indentation characters like spaces, tabs, and newlines.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` aims to compare correctly formatted code contents when spaces and tabs are used for indentation.
3. The error occurs due to incorrect handling of the newline character and tab-related column calculations in the function.
4. To resolve the issue, we need to adjust the logic for handling newline characters and reset the current column appropriately.

## Bug:
The bug stems from the function incorrectly setting the `wait_for_nl` flag, which leads to wrong calculations of `current_column` when encountering newline characters. This results in misalignment of the comment indentation in the test cases with tabs.

## Fix strategy:
1. Properly track the `wait_for_nl` condition and reset the `current_column` when encountering newline characters.
2. Ensure correct handling of newline characters to properly determine the comment indentation alignment based on the column value.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            current_line += char
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False

            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

            current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

Now, the corrected function should handle the newline characters and column calculations accurately, aligning the comment indentation as expected in the failing test cases with tabs.
