### Analysis:
1. The `test_comment_indentation` test function checks if the `assertFormatEqual` assertion for two different types of indentation formats (`contents_tab` and `contents_spc`) passes or fails.
2. The failing test message indicates a failure in the assertion due to incorrect indentation changes.
3. The `expected` and `actual` values in the failing test suggest that the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not handling the indentation correctly for comments.
4. The issue mentioned on GitHub also points out the incorrect indentation behavior for tabulated comments after a dedent, which aligns with the failing test case.

### Bug Cause:
The main cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of indentation levels for comments when processing the prefix string. The function fails to maintain the indentation level for comments in certain scenarios leading to incorrect output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation for different types of characters like space, tab, newline, and correctly aligns comments.
2. Correctly identify and track the current column positioning after each character to maintain the correct level of indentation.
3. Introduce checks to handle situations where comments are not at the same indentation level as the following lines.

### Updated Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                if current_line.strip():
                    lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the function as above, the handling of indentation levels before and after comments should be corrected to pass the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
