### Analysis:
1. The `test_comment_indentation` test function is failing due to incorrect behavior in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. The failing test expects a specific output after processing the input contents, but the function returns a different value.
2. The function correctly processes indentation spaces and tabs but has an issue related to handling comments within the indentation.
3. The bug causes incorrect handling of comment indentation after a dedent operation, leading to a mismatch between expected and actual output for the failing test scenario.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic to correctly handle comment indentation based on the given column value.
5. The corrected function should align the comment indentation with the following line, maintaining the proper indentation structure.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    # Fix the comment indentation
                    if current_line.lstrip().startswith('#') and current_column > 0:
                        current_line = " " * current_column + current_line.lstrip()
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying this fix, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should handle comment indentation correctly, aligning it with the surrounding code structure. The corrected function should pass the failing test cases and align with the expected input/output values, addressing the reported GitHub issue related to incorrect comment indentation behavior.
