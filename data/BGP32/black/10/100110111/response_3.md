### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to process and partially consume a prefix string based on indentation rules. The function loops through each character in the prefix string, updating the current line, column position, and waiting for a newline character if needed.

The failing test `test_comment_indentation` aims to check the correct handling of comments indentation on different lines. The error message highlights a mismatch between expected and actual output for handling comments indentation, which indicates a problem in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function.

The expected values and types provided for different cases help to understand the correct behavior of the function based on input parameters and internal variables.

### Error Location
The bug seems to reside in the logic related to indentation handling in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, particularly when waiting for a newline character after the comment. The incorrect indentation of the comment when it's supposed to align with the next line after a dedent suggests a flaw in the handling of tab characters or spaces for indentation.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs when a comment line does not match the expected indentation level after dedenting. The function incorrectly adjusts the indentation levels due to the way tab and space characters are processed. This leads to the comment being misplaced compared to the surrounding code.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the issue, the function needs to accurately handle the indentation behavior, especially when encountering tab characters and spaces. The logic for determining the correct column position after a dedent and waiting for a newline character must be adjusted to ensure proper alignment of comments.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)  # Adjust to handle tab characters properly
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version adjusts the handling of tab characters in the indentation calculations to ensure proper alignment of comments after dedenting. Additionally, the logic for newline characters and maintaining column positions has been refined to address the specific issue reported in the failing test and GitHub issue.
