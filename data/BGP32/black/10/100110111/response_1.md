### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partial consumption of a given prefix based on a given column number.
2. The function maintains lines, current_line, current_column, and wait_for_nl variables to keep track of the input prefix as it iterates character by character.
3. The function aims to correctly handle indentation and alignment for different characters like spaces, tabs, and newlines while checking the column value.
4. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` compares the expected format of code with spaces to the format generated by the function with tabs, resulting in an AssertionError due to improper spacing after comments.
5. The bug leads to incorrect handling of indentation when a comment is aligned differently in the given prefix.
6. The expected values and types for different cases highlight the discrepancies between the current code behavior and the desired behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to incorrect handling of indentation spaces for comments when mixed with tabs in the input prefix. The function fails to maintain consistent indentation after dedents, resulting in incorrect spacing for comments.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles the indentation for comments in scenarios involving mixed tab and space characters. We should review the logic related to newline characters and indentation calculations to maintain consistency in the output format.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic to ensure the correct handling of newline characters and alignment after dedents, the corrected function aims to resolve the bug related to comment indentation issues.
