### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` aims to consume a portion of the prefix string based on column information.
2. The buggy function fails to handle tab characters correctly, leading to incorrect indentation for comments.
3. The failing test case `test_comment_indentation` compares the output of the function against the expected string and raises an assertion error due to incorrect indentation.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the handling of tab characters and indentation levels for comments.

### Bug Cause:
The root cause of the bug lies in the insufficient handling of tabs within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. Tab characters are not accounted for correctly, leading to incorrect calculations of column positions and subsequent incorrect indentation for comments after dedent operations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the treatment of tab characters to ensure proper counting of columns.
2. Adjust the logic related to handling indentation levels, especially for comments following a dedent operation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 8 + 1) * 8
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function includes handling for tab characters to appropriately calculate column positions and manage indentation levels. This modification resolves the bug causing incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent operation.
