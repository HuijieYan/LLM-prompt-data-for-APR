### Analyzing the buggy function and failing test

- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to be designed to partially consume an input string `prefix` up to a certain `column` value, handling spaces, tabs, and newline characters. However, the presence of some logical conditions and variable updates within the function might be causing unexpected behavior.
- The failing test `test_comment_indentation` checks the correct handling of comments indentation after dedent for both space and tab indentation styles. The test fails due to a discrepancy in handling comments on dedent, leading to an assertion error.

### Potential error locations within the buggy function

1. Handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag and logic for indent finishing might be causing issues.
2. In the case of newline characters, the current logic might be resetting the `current_column` value inappropriately.

### Cause of the bug

The bug arises due to incorrect handling of comments indentation after a dedent. When a dedent occurs, the function should maintain the original indentation level for subsequent comments. However, the logic inside the function is causing a shift in comment indentation, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual values.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, the logic within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function needs to be revised to correctly preserve the indentation level of comments after dedent. Specific attention should be given to the conditions involving newline characters and the maintenance of the `current_column` value.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:  # Modified column check to include equal case
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:  # Modified column check for newline
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the adjustments highlighted in the corrected version of the function above, the function should now handle comments indentation after dedent correctly, ensuring that the failing test `test_comment_indentation` passes as expected.
