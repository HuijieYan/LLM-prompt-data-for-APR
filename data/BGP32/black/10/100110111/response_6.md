### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partial consumption of a prefix based on a given column value. The function keeps track of the current line, column, and looks for newline characters to determine when to stop. However, the logic for handling tabs and spaces is causing the indentation issue.

#### Issue:
The function currently does not handle the conversion between tabs and spaces correctly when calculating the current column. This leads to incorrect indentation and a failure in the test case related to comment indentation.

#### Bug Cause:
1. When encountering a tab character, the function should increment `current_column` by 8 spaces instead of 4 to match Python's indentation standard.
2. The logic for handling '\n' characters resets the `current_column` to 0 prematurely, affecting subsequent line indentations.

#### Steps to Fix:
1. Correct the calculation of `current_column` for tab characters to increment by 8.
2. Modify the logic for handling '\n' characters to differentiate between empty lines and actual changes in indentation.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            current_column += 8
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            if wait_for_nl:
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the corrections mentioned above, the function now handles tabs and spaces correctly for indentation, aligning with the expected behavior.
