### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix based on a specific column in the code indentation.
2. The function processes each character in the prefix, tracking the current line, current column, and waiting for a newline character to handle indentation changes.
3. The bug appears when handling tab characters followed by comments after a dedent operation. It fails to maintain the correct indentation for comments in such cases.
4. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` demonstrates the discrepancy between the expected and actual output for the mentioned scenario.
5. The expected values and types for critical variables in different cases are provided to guide the bug fix.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of comments after dedent operations in the presence of tab characters. The function fails to properly adjust the comment indentation level, leading to the failing test case and assertion error.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` needs to accurately determine the correct indentation level for comments after dedent operations. Adjustments should be made to ensure that comment lines maintain the correct relative indentation compared to the code block they belong to, especially when dealing with tab characters.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the handling of tab characters in the `elif char == '\t':` block, the corrected function should now maintain the correct comment indentation level after dedent operations involving tabs. This modification aims to resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue related to incorrect comment indentation behavior in this specific scenario.
