### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string until a certain column is reached. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that there is a problem with the indentation of tabulated comments after a dedent operation.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The calculation of column while iterating through the prefix string may not be handling tab characters correctly.
2. The condition for handling tab characters may be incorrect.
3. The logic for handling indentation with '\n' characters may be causing unexpected behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function does not handle tab characters appropriately when calculating the current column due to which the indentation issue occurs with tabulated comments.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the logic for handling tab characters to ensure correct indentation.
2. Adjust the calculation of the current column based on '\t' character.
3. Ensure that the condition for wait_for_nl and handling '\n' characters is properly managed to avoid unexpected behavior.

### Correction Implemented:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Adjust for tab characters
        elif char == '\n':
            if wait_for_nl:  # Check for wait_for_nl condition
                current_column = 0
            else:  # Handle unexpected empty lines
                current_line += '\n'
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Corrected Version:
The corrected version of the function includes adjustments to correctly handle tab characters for indentation calculations and ensuring the logic for newline characters is appropriately managed. This should help in resolving the issue with incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent operation.
