### Analysis:
The `partially_consume_prefix` function is responsible for consuming lines of text up to a specified column limit. The issue reported on GitHub seems related to incorrect handling of tabs leading to incorrect indentation of comments after a dedent.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of tab characters and spaces in the `current_column` calculation.
2. Identifying when to wait for a new line after an indent.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be caused by the mishandling of tab characters (`'\t'`) in the calculation of the `current_column`. As tabs are treated as a single character, `current_column` should be incremented by the equivalent spaces added until the next multiple of 4 (the default tab width).

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the handling of tab characters to increment `current_column` by the equivalent spaces added by the tab until the next column multiple of 4.
2. Adjust the logic to handle the wait for a newline after an indent correctly.
3. Consider the logic for current line construction and newline handling carefully.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)  # Handle tabs appropriately
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Changes Made:
1. Updated the handling of tab characters in the `current_column` calculation.
2. Adjusted the calculation to ensure tabs increment the column correctly.
3. No direct modifications to newline logic due to tabs issue.
4. Comments added for clear understanding.

This corrected version aims to handle tab characters appropriately and avoid incorrect indentation as reported in the GitHub issue.
