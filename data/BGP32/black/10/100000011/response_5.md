### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is used to consume a prefix string until a certain column index while handling indentation in the prefix. The function seems to be incorrectly handling tab characters (\t) as 4 characters instead of 1 character, which leads to incorrect column count calculation.

### Potential error locations:
1. Incorrect handling of tab characters.
2. Incorrect update of the `current_column` counter.
3. Incorrect line accumulation and line break handling.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug described in the GitHub issue is due to incorrect handling of tab characters (\t) in the prefix string. The function miscounts tab characters as 4 characters, leading to incorrect column detection and, eventually, incorrect indentation when reformatted.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle tab characters by counting them as a single character ("\t"). Additionally, we need to ensure correct column counting when processing the prefix string.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            if wait_for_nl:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1

            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Changes made:
1. Updated the logic to correctly handle tab characters as a single character ("\t") and adjust the column count accordingly.
2. Ensured correct column counting for each character in the prefix.
3. Fixed the condition to properly handle line breaks ("\n") and indentation levels.

By correcting the handling of tab characters and ensuring accurate column counting, this corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should be able to consume the prefix string correctly and avoid the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
