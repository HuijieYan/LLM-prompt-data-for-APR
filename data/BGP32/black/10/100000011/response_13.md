### Analysis:
The provided buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not correctly handling the indentation of tabulated comments after a dedent operation. This issue is related to the reported GitHub issue titled "Indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent".

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The logic for handling tabulation and indentations might not be appropriate for tabulated comments.
2. Incorrect logic for tracking and updating the current column position.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the `_partially_consume_prefix` function incorrectly handling the indentation of tabulated comments after a dedent. The function fails to properly adjust the indentation level of tabulated comments, leading to incorrect formatting when encountering tabulated comments in the input code.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` needs to correctly handle the indentation of tabulated comments after a dedent. This can be achieved by adjusting the logic that tracks the current column position and ensures that tabulated comments are indented correctly relative to the surrounding code.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function that resolves the issue related to incorrect tabulated comment indentation:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Adjust to the appropriate tab size
        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset current column if line ends
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # Adjust the logic to handle tabulated comments
            if not current_line.strip().startswith('#'):  # Ignore comments
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By incorporating the corrections mentioned above, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` should now handle the indentation of tabulated comments properly after a dedent operation.
