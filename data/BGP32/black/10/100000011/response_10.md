### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is incorrectly handling the indentation of comments after a dedent. The function is used to partially consume a prefix of text until a certain column width is reached based on the provided prefix and the desired column. The bug in this function potentially causes incorrect behavior in handling newlines, spaces, tabs, and comments.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The logic for handling whitespace characters (space, tab) and newlines may not be correctly updating the `current_column` count.
2. The condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` might not be correctly determining when to stop consuming the prefix.
3. The `wait_for_nl` flag may not be set/reset appropriately.

### Bug Cause:
The bug mentioned in the GitHub issue is due to incorrect handling of tabulated comments after a dedent. The current function does not correctly manage the logic for maintaining the correct indentation level for comments after a dedent. This leads to the incorrect reformatting of the code provided in the GitHub issue.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the function correctly handles the tabulation level for comments.
2. Update the logic to track the correct indentation using tabs.
3. Verify that the function correctly identifies when to consume the prefix based on indentation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    tab_width = 4  # Set the tab width to 4 spaces, as in the provided example
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += tab_width  # Increase current column by tab width
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Conclusion:
The corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now correctly handle the indentation of tabulated comments after a dedent, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
