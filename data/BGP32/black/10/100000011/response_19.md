### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is a function that partially consumes the prefix based on a given column. The function processes each character of the prefix string and keeps track of the current line, column, and whether to wait for a newline character or not.

### Error Location:
The potential error locations in the buggy function are related to tracking the current line and column, handling whitespace characters (space, tab), and dealing with newline characters.

1. The condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` might not accurately handle the indentation level in certain scenarios.
2. The usage of `wait_for_nl` to detect the end of an indentation block could be causing issues.
3. Handling of tabs (`\t`) and their equivalent column advancement.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is related to incorrect handling of the indentation levels when dealing with tabulated comments after a dedent. The function fails to maintain proper alignment for comments that should be on the same indentation level as the next line.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and address the GitHub issue, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles tabulated comments after a dedent. This may involve properly tracking the indentation level, handling tabs, and aligning comments based on the actual indentation level.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # Handle tabs by aligning to multiples of 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip():
                lines.append(current_line)
            current_column = 0
            current_line = ""
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, tabs are handled by aligning the current column to the next multiple of 4. Additionally, newline characters are handled properly to preserve the correct alignment of comments. This should help resolve the indentation issue with tabulated comments after a dedent.
