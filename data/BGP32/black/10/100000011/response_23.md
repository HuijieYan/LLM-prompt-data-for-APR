**Analysis:**

The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is used to consume a prefix string until a specific column limit is reached. However, the bug reported on GitHub is related to incorrect indentation changes for tabulated comments after a dedent. This means that the function is not handling tabs properly when calculating the column position, leading to incorrect indentation behavior.

**Error Location:**

The potential error locations within the buggy function are the calculations of the `current_column` position when encountering spaces or tabs.

**Cause of the Bug:**

The bug is caused by incorrect handling of tab characters (`\t`) in the function. In the provided buggy function, the calculation of `current_column` for tab characters should be adjusting the column position by 4 spaces (standard tab width). However, the current implementation mistakenly increments the column by 4 characters for each tab encountered, which leads to incorrect calculations of the column position.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the calculation of the `current_column` when encountering tab characters (`\t`). Instead of incrementing the column by 4 characters, we should increment the column by 4 spaces, considering the standard tab width.

**Corrected Version:**

Here is the corrected version of the function `_partially_consume_prefix`:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 # Adjust the column position by 4 spaces for a tab character
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By correcting the column calculation for tab characters to adjust the position by 4 spaces, the function should now handle tabulated comments after a dedent correctly, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
