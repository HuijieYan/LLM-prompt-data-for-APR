### Issue Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming the prefix based on specific conditions like space, tab, or newline characters. The function seems to have an issue with handling the indentation level when encountering tabs in the prefix.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of tab characters (`'\t'`) in the function.
2. The logic for updating the `current_column` when encountering tab characters might be incorrect.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the function to incorrectly adjust the indentation level of comments when tabs are encountered. This aligns with the GitHub issue describing a problem with indentation after dedent when using tabs in the input file.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the handling of tab characters (`'\t'`) in the function is correctly implemented. Specifically, the calculation of `current_column` needs to be adjusted to align with the expected behavior when tabs are present in the prefix.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = ((current_column // 4) + 1) * 4  # Update current_column handling for tabs
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function now handles tab characters correctly and ensures that the indentation level is adjusted appropriately based on the presence of tabs in the prefix. This fix should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue related to incorrect indentation after dedent when using tabs in the input file.
