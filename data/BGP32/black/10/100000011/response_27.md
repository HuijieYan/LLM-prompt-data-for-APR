### Analysis:
The `partially_consume_prefix` function is used to partially consume a given prefix while preserving the relative indentation. However, there seems to be a bug in handling tab characters (`\t`) which leads to incorrect indentation, as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of tab characters (`\t`) in the current_column calculation.
2. Logic for maintaining the correct current_column value.
3. Managing indentation levels with tabs.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to improper handling of tab characters `\t` in the calculation of the `current_column` value. When encountering a tab character, the function incorrectly increments the `current_column` by 4, causing issues with maintaining correct indentation levels, especially after dedents.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Adjust the logic related to tab characters (`\t`) in computing the `current_column`.
2. Ensure that the function correctly handles tab characters and maintains the appropriate indentation levels.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # Adjust current_column for tabs
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Changes Made:
1. Modified the logic for handling tab characters (`\t`) by ensuring that `current_column` is adjusted correctly to align with the next multiple of 4 columns.
2. Updated the calculation of `current_column` with tabs to prevent incorrect indentation after dedents.
3. Comments added to clarify the correction and make the function more readable.

By making these changes, the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now handle tab characters properly and maintain the correct indentation level.
