### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is used to consume a prefix string up to a certain column in a text editor. The issue reported on GitHub is related to incorrect changes in the indentation of tabulated comments after a dedent operation. The bug seems to be impacting the correct handling of tab characters in the input text.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of tab characters (`\t`) causing incorrect column calculation.
2. Inconsistent handling of newline characters (`\n`) and column positions.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of tab characters (`\t`) in the input text. Since tabs are equivalent to multiple spaces in Python code, not properly accounting for their length disrupts the column calculation logic. This leads to incorrect behavior when processing comments after dedent operations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Adjust the column increment when encountering a tab character to consider its equivalent space length.
2. Ensure proper handling of newline characters to maintain accurate column positions.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            effective_spaces = 4 - (current_column % 4)  # Calculate remaining spaces for complete tab
            current_line += ' ' * effective_spaces
            current_column += effective_spaces
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Changes Made:
1. Added logic to calculate the effective spaces for tab characters to mimic their equivalent space length.
2. Adjusted the condition in the return statement to account for the column position.
3. Made minor adjustments for more accurate column tracking.

By implementing these changes, the corrected function should now handle tab characters correctly, ensuring proper indentation handling after dedent operations.
