### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to extract and return a prefix up to a certain column in the given input prefix. The bug reported in the GitHub issue relates to incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent, particularly when tabs are used in the input file. The function processes characters, moves lines, and handles indentation level tracking.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of tab characters causing column misalignment.
2. Inconsistent tracking of the current column reference.
3. Logic related to waiting for the newline character.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the current implementation seems to be caused by the inconsistent handling of tab characters (`'\t'`) and indentation processing. This inconsistency leads to incorrect column calculations and consequently results in misaligned comment indentation after a dedent in the input code.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the logic related to tab character handling to ensure accurate column tracking.
2. Improve the newline character logic to handle indentation and line tracking effectively.
3. Enhance the function to correctly handle the dedent scenarios, considering tabs as well as spaces.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            # Calculate tab spaces based on column alignment
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else len(char)

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False

        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset column reference for a new line
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Changes Made:
1. Added dedicated logic for handling tab characters to correctly adjust the current column.
2. Adjusted the conditions for handling newline characters and updated the check for proper dedent and line tracking.
3. Refactored the column calculation logic to accommodate both tabs and spaces effectively.

By incorporating these changes, the corrected function should resolve the reported issue related to incorrect comment indentation after a dedent, especially when tabs are used in the input file.
