### Analysis:
The provided buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for consuming a prefix of characters until a certain column limit is reached. The function is essential in handling the indentation of code.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The logic for handling tabs and adjusting the column count may be incorrect.
2. The condition for identifying when to wait for a new line might not be working as expected.
3. The return statement might not be providing the correct prefix and remaining part after consuming.

### Bug Cause:
The bug reported in the GitHub issue seems to be related to incorrect handling of tabs and the subsequent indentation after dedenting. Since the function `_partially_consume_prefix` deals with indentation while consuming the prefix characters, the bug might be due to the improper adjustment of the column count when encountering tabs.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent, we need to ensure that the column count is properly adjusted when encountering tabs. Additionally, we should review the logic for identifying when to wait for a new line in order to handle the indentation correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # Adjust column count for tabs
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Changes Made:
1. Introduced a corrected logic for adjusting the column count when encountering tabs to handle proper indentation.
2. Modified the calculation of the column count for tabs to ensure it aligns with the actual indentation.
3. No changes made to the core structure of the function, only updated the tab handling mechanism.
