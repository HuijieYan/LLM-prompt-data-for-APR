### Analysis:
The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming a prefix string up to a certain column position. It seems that the issue reported on GitHub is related to incorrect handling of whitespace characters (`' '` and `'\t'`) and newlines (`'\n'`) that result in incorrect indentation in certain cases.

### Potential error locations:
1. Incorrectly updating the `current_column` after encountering a newline character.
2. Handling of whitespace characters and tab characters that affect the `current_column`.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function causes issues with preserving the correct column positions based on different types of characters in the prefix string. This leads to incorrect indentation when there are tabs in the input code.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the calculation of `current_column` for different types of characters (`' '`, `'\t'`, `'\n'`) to accurately track the column position.
2. Ensure that when encountering a newline character, the `current_column` is reset appropriately to maintain correct indentation levels.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 1
            while current_column % 4 != 0:  # adjust column for tab
                current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version adjusts the `current_column` variable correctly for tab characters and ensures that the newline character resets the column position. This should address the indentation issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
