**Analysis:**
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming a prefix of characters from a string based on certain conditions. The function keeps track of the current line, column, and waits for a new line before taking further action. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of indentation when encountering tabs or spaces in the input.

**Error Locations:**
1. The logic for updating `current_column` based on tab or space characters seems incorrect.
2. The condition for identifying the end of an indent (wait_for_nl) might not be triggered correctly.

**Cause of the Bug:**
The bug arises due to the incorrect handling of tabs and spaces during the processing of the prefix string. This leads to inconsistencies in the indentation levels, especially in cases involving a mix of tabs and spaces.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**
1. Review how columns are being handled when encountering tabs and spaces.
2. Verify the condition for transitioning from one line to the next after an indent.
3. Ensure that the correct indent level is maintained when consuming the prefix string.

**Corrected Version:**
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Update the column based on tabs
        elif char == '\n':
            # Check for unexpected empty line
            if not current_line.strip():
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    if current_line.strip():
        lines.append(current_line)
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version adjusts the handling of tabs to increment the `current_column` by 4 positions. It also ensures that a new line is correctly detected when encountering a newline character. Additionally, the logic for handling unexpected empty lines has been updated to maintain the correct output format.
