### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for consuming a prefix string while considering column and indentation level. The function seems to incorrectly handle tabulated characters, leading to an error when processing indentation-related issues.

### Identified Error:
1. The function does not correctly handle tab characters in terms of calculating the indentation level and column position.
2. When encountering tab characters (`\t`), the function increments the `current_column` by a fixed value of 4, which is incorrect.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug described in the GitHub issue is related to incorrect handling of tab characters for indentation. The function's incorrect calculation of column positions for tab characters leads to improper indentation of comments after a dedent operation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the function handles tab characters. Instead of adding a fixed value to `current_column` for each tab character encountered, we should update it based on the tab width prevailing in the file. This ensures correct alignment and indentation levels.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column, tab_width):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += tab_width - (current_column % tab_width)
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, the `current_column` is updated based on the `tab_width` provided, ensuring proper handling of tab characters and maintaining correct indentation levels.
