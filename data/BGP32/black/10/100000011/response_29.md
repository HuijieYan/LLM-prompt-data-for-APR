## Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming the prefix provided based on indentation levels. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the indentation for comments after a dedent is changed incorrectly when the input file uses tabs.

## Potential error locations:
1. The condition to handle tabs (char == '\t') might not be adjusting the current_column correctly.
2. The logic for handling indentation after dedent (wait_for_nl) might not be working as intended.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug is likely caused by the function not properly handling tab characters ('\t') in the input prefix, which leads to incorrect indentation adjustments.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Adjust the current_column calculation for tab characters ('\t') to ensure the correct indentation tracking.
- Review and possibly revise the logic for handling indentation levels after a dedent to maintain the correct alignment.

## Corrected Version:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Adjusting for tab character
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

## Summary:
The corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function has been adjusted to properly handle tab characters ('\t') for maintaining the correct indentation levels. This should address the reported issue of incorrect indentation changes for tabulated comments after a dedent.
