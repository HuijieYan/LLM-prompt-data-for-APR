### Analysis:
The provided buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is used to consume a prefix string until a certain column and return the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix. The function handles different scenarios for characters such as spaces, tabs, and new lines to correctly calculate the column position and consume the prefix accordingly.

### Error Location:
The bug in the function might be related to the calculation of the current column position and the logic to handle new lines and indentation changes.

### Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug can be identified as the incorrect handling of tab characters `\t` within the `prefix`. When a tab character is encountered, the function incorrectly increments the `current_column` value by 4, assuming the tab width to be 4 spaces. This wrong assumption leads to incorrect indentation calculation and issues with consuming the prefix correctly, as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correct how the function handles tab characters. Instead of simply incrementing `current_column` by a fixed value (4 in this case), we should calculate the correct tab width based on the surrounding context to maintain accurate indentation levels. This adjustment will ensure that the function correctly consumes the prefix without altering the original tab-based indentation.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    spaces = 0
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Calculate tab width based on the current_column
            tab_width = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_line += ' ' * tab_width
            current_column += tab_width
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            current_line += char
        else:
            # Non-space and non-tab characters
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line

```

In the corrected version:
- We handle tab characters correctly by calculating the tab width based on the current column. This ensures that the function maintains the correct indentation levels according to the existing tab settings.
- The logic for consuming the prefix and handling new lines remains intact, ensuring that the function works as expected even with tab characters.

By applying these corrections, the function should now be able to correctly consume prefixes with tab characters and maintain the original indentation level, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
