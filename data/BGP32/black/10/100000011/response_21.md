### Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the GitHub issue:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is related to indentation handling in Python code. The function is supposed to consume a prefix string but has a bug where it does not handle the tab character (`\t`) appropriately when calculating indentation levels. This could lead to incorrect indentation changes, especially after a dedent operation.

### Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. Incorrect handling of tab character (`\t`) in calculating the current column.
2. Logic for handling waiting for a new line (`wait_for_nl`) might not be working as intended.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug in the function is related to the incorrect calculation of indentation levels when encountering tab characters (`\t`). This is crucial in Python code where indentation is significant. The incorrect handling of tabs leads to unwanted behavior in indentation levels.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that tab characters are appropriately accounted for in calculating the current column.
2. Make sure that the logic for waiting for a new line is triggered correctly based on the encountered characters.

### Corrected version of the function to address the bug:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should address the issue related to incorrect indentation changes for tabulated comments after a dedent operation. It ensures that the tab character is appropriately handled when calculating the current column position, thus maintaining the correct indentation levels as expected in Python code.
