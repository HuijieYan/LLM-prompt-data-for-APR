### Analysis:

1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for handling the indentation of the input text.
2. The `wait_for_nl` flag is used to track whether the function is waiting for a new line to handle the indentation.
3. The issue reported on GitHub is related to incorrect handling of indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
4. The bug is likely occurring because the function is not properly handling tab characters when calculating the column number for indentation.
5. The `current_column` variable is not correctly updated for tab characters and leads to incorrect indentation behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the improper handling of tab characters in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. The function does not increment the `current_column` value correctly when encountering tab characters, leading to incorrect indentation calculations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that tab characters are properly handled when calculating the column number for indentation. We should update the logic for tab characters to increment the `current_column` by 4 units (assuming a tab width of 4) instead of just 1.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    tab_width = 4  # Assuming tab width is 4 units

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += tab_width  # Increment by tab width units
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0  # Reset column number for new line
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function fixes the bug by properly handling tab characters when calculating the column number for indentation. Now, the function should correctly handle tabulated comments after a dedent as reported in the GitHub issue.
