### Analysis:
The provided buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for handling indentation and line breaks in the code. The bug described in the GitHub issue pertains to incorrect indentation changes for tabulated comments after a dedent. This bug is likely related to how the function handles tabs and spaces when processing the input prefix.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of tabs and spaces.
2. Inadequate logic for tracking columns and line breaks.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the existing logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function does not properly handle tabs when calculating the column position. This causes issues when dealing with tabulated comments and can result in incorrect indentation changes after a dedent.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles tabs while calculating the column position. Additionally, the logic for indentations and line breaks should be adjusted to maintain consistent behavior, especially for tabulated comments.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Adjust the column position for tabs (assuming a tab is equivalent to 4 spaces)
            current_column = (current_column // 4) * 4 + 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, the function now correctly handles tab characters when calculating the column position. This adjustment should address the issue described in the GitHub report related to incorrect indentation changes for tabulated comments after a dedent.
