### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is used to partially consume a prefix string until a certain column index is reached.
- The issue reported on GitHub pertains to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
- The function seems to mishandle tabs and spaces while calculating column indexes, which could lead to incorrect behavior for tabulated comments.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of tabs and spaces while incrementing `current_column`.
2. Checking for the end of current line or reaching the desired column index.
3. Logic for waiting for a newline character before continuing further.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The function incorrectly calculates the column index when encountering tabs (`\t`). This issue might affect the indentation level, especially when tabs are used in the code.
- Due to incorrect handling of tabs, the function fails to accurately determine the column index at certain points, leading to unexpected behavior with comment indentation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the logic for incrementing `current_column` to correctly handle both tabs and spaces.
2. Ensure that the function properly keeps track of the current line and column index to maintain accurate indentation levels.
3. Adjust the conditions for waiting for a newline character to correctly handle the behavior after a dedent.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            # Correctly handle tabs by advancing to the next tab stop
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1

            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 3  # Adjust column increment for space character

            if wait_for_nl and char == '\n':
                continue

            if current_column >= column:
                wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Changes in the Corrected Version:
- Adjusted the logic for incrementing `current_column` to handle tabs correctly by moving to the next tab stop.
- Updated the conditions to check for newlines and characters like spaces to ensure proper handling of column indexes.
- Made adjustments to correctly transition and wait for a newline character before proceeding further.

By applying these corrections, the function should now handle tabulated comments and indentations accurately based on the reported issue on GitHub.
