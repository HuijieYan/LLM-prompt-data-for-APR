### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for handling the indentation logic within the code. The function tokenizes the input string and handles indentation tracking based on tabs and spaces. However, the bug reported in the GitHub issue indicates that the indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent operation.

### Potential error locations:
1. Incorrect tracking of tab-based indentation.
2. Improper handling of whitespace characters.
3. Misinterpretation of column and line tracking.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs due to the function `_partially_consume_prefix` not correctly handling tab-based indentation. When the function encounters a dedent operation that involves tabs, it fails to maintain the correct tabulation for comments beyond depth 0. This leads to incorrect indentation levels for comments after a dedent operation.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function accurately tracks tab-based indentation and maintains the correct levels of indentation for comments following a dedent operation.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    current_indent = 0  # Track the current level of indentation based on tabs
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                current_indent = 0  # Reset the current level of indentation
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Increment the current indentation level by 1, or adjust based on the tab width
            current_indent += 1
            current_column = 0  # Reset the column count when encountering a tab
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            current_indent = 0  # Reset the current level of indentation for new lines
        else:
            # Check if the current character is a comment and adjust the indentation level
            if char == '#':
                if current_indent > 0:  # Adjust the indentation for comments based on the tab level
                    current_column = current_indent * 4  # Assuming 4 spaces per tab
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function includes additional logic to properly handle tab-based indentation and adjust the indentation level for comments based on the tab depth. By accurately tracking the tab-based indentation levels, the function will ensure that comments following a dedent operation maintain the correct indentation.
