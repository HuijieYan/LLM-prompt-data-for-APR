### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is that it does not correctly handle the indentation levels when consuming the prefix characters. This results in incorrect line formation and ultimately failing the test case `test_comment_indentation`.

### Bug Explanation:
The function fails to correctly handle the indentation levels when going through the prefix characters. It misunderstands the indent levels due to mixing tab and space characters. This leads to incorrect line formation and comparison failures, as seen in the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address this issue, we need to modify the logic of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the different indent levels created by tabs and spaces. By accurately tracking the current indentation level and formation of lines, we can ensure correct parsing of the prefix.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (4 - current_column % 4)
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected behavior
            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After making these corrections, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now handle the indentation levels correctly, allowing the failing test case to pass successfully.
