### Issue Analysis
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from incorrect handling of the indentation columns when encountering a comment in the prefix string. The function fails to properly account for trailing spaces or tabs after the comment character, leading to differences in the output that causes the failing test.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs when the function encounters a comment line. It starts waiting for a newline character (wait_for_nl = True) to signify the end of the comment. However, in Case 1 and Case 5 where the comment line is followed by spaces or tabs, the function incorrectly counts those indentation characters, leading to a mismatch in the output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To address the bug, we need to modify the code logic to accurately handle whitespace characters following the comment. Specifically, we should skip counting such characters as part of the current_column to maintain the correct alignment.

### Corrected Function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':
            # comment encountered, reset current_column to preserve correct alignment
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected function, the bug related to comment handling in the prefix string should be resolved, and the failing test should pass without any assertion errors.
