### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is tasked with consuming a part of a given prefix string until a certain column limit is reached. It splits the consumed part into lines and returns the remaining part of the prefix.
- The bug seems to arise when adding a newline character in the consumed lines but not considering the indentation level properly.
- The function fails to correctly handle the indentation level and alignment of comment lines, resulting in a mismatch with the expected output in the failing test.

### Bug Cause:
1. In Case 1 and Case 5, the function fails to correctly handle the indentation in the consumed lines after encountering newline characters with comments, resulting in an offset in the output.
2. It does not accurately track the column positions based on the indentation levels and fails to align comments correctly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the logic to accurately handle the indentation level while consuming the prefix.
2. Ensure that when inserting consumed lines, the function considers the correct column positions based on the indentation level.
3. Adjust the handling of different indentation characters like spaces and tabs to maintain proper alignment.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the above corrections to the function, it should now handle the indentation levels and alignment of comments correctly, ensuring that the failing test cases pass successfully.
