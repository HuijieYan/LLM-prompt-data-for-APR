### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the logic used to handle indentation levels and newlines. In the provided function, when encountering a newline character (`\n`), the current column count is reset to 0 regardless of the context. This results in incorrect handling of indentation levels in cases where there are spaces or tabs after a newline character.

The critical issue occurs when the function encounters a newline character while waiting for a newline (`wait_for_nl = True`). In that case, it resets the `current_column` to 0 without considering the actual indentation level. This leads to incorrect results and mismatched output in cases involving mixed indentation styles.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to adjust how the `current_column` is updated when encountering a newline. Instead of always resetting it to 0, we should conditionally update it based on the existing indentation level of spaces or tabs. This adjustment will ensure that the `current_column` reflects the correct indentation level at all times.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By incorporating the suggested fixes to update the `current_column` correctly when encountering newlines, the corrected version of the function should now handle mixed indentation styles accurately and pass the failing test cases.
