### Error Identification:
The main issue in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to how the function handles the indentation of comments in Python code. The function fails to correctly adjust the column count when encountering comments, leading to incorrect indentation comparison.

1. The `wait_for_nl` flag is supposed to indicate that the function should wait until encountering a newline before making further decisions. However, it is not consistently handled, leading to incorrect behavior.

2. When encountering a '#' character (comment), the function should not count it towards the column count. This is crucial for maintaining proper indentation alignment.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure correct handling of comments and adjust the column count appropriately. The function should not increment the current column counter when encountering a comment and make sure to reset it after encountering a newline.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == '#':
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By correctly handling comments and newline characters, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test scenarios.
