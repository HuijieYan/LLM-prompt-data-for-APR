### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function when it is trying to handle the indentation levels between spaces and tabs. The function incorrectly handles the case when encountering a space character (' ') in the prefix by incrementing the `current_column` variable by 1. This leads to incorrect column counting and results in the function not properly aligning the comment lines in the output.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the space character (' ') in the prefix to increment the `current_column` by the appropriate number of spaces (4 spaces) as defined in the indentation rules. We also need to account for tabs ('\t') correctly by incrementing `current_column` by 4 for each tab encountered.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            # increment column by 4 for each space
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\t':
            # increment column by 4 for each tab
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making these adjustments to the function, it should correctly handle the indentation levels between spaces and tabs, ensuring that comments are aligned properly regardless of the input prefix.
