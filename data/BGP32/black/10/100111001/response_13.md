### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the condition where it checks if the character is a newline (`\n`) to determine if it should add the current line to the lines list. However, the bug occurs when the function encounters a newline character preceded by spaces or tabs, which leads to incorrect line parsing and indentation handling.

The issue stems from the implementation of the `wait_for_nl` logic in conjunction with how the `current_column` is updated. The function incorrectly assumes that a new line character directly results in the start of a new line, but in cases where there are spaces or tabs preceding the newline character, the current line should still be processed and appended.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we should adjust the condition for appending the current line to the `lines` list. When encountering a newline character, we should always append the current line to `lines`, even if it starts with spaces or tabs. We can modify the logic to incorporate this change and ensure correct handling of indentations and line breaks.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char != ' ' and char != '\t':
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By making this adjustment, the function should now correctly handle cases where newline characters are preceded by spaces or tabs and ensure accurate processing of line indentation.
