The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the handling of whitespace characters and the logic to determine when to consume the prefix up to a certain column. The issue arises when encountering tabs and spaces in the input prefix, leading to incorrect column calculation and prefix consumption.

The key problem is that the function incorrectly updates the `current_column` when encountering tabs or spaces. It should update the `current_column` based on the number of spaces equivalent to a tab character.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the `current_column` is updated for tabs, spaces, and newlines. We should also ensure that the function correctly consumes the prefix up to the specified column.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures that the column count is appropriately incremented for tabs and spaces and correctly consumes the prefix up to the specified column position.

After applying this correction, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now work correctly and pass the failing tests.
