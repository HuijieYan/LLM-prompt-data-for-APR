### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to have an issue with handling the indentation of comments properly. The function accumulates characters until it encounters a newline character, then checks if the accumulated line should be included in the result based on the indentation level. There seems to be a problem when encountering a comment with a higher indentation level than expected.

The failing test `test_comment_indentation` checks the indentation of comments by transforming tabs to spaces and comparing the result with the expected content. The error message indicates a mismatch between the transformed content with spaces and the expected content, specifically highlighting the comment indentation issue.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the logic that checks for the end of an indentation block marked by a newline character. When encountering a comment with an indentation level higher than the column value given, the algorithm incorrectly returns the line containing the comment without considering the indentation level. This results in incorrect line handling in the case of comments.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic that handles the indentation check for comments. The function should consider the indentation of comments when deciding which lines to append to the result. We can modify the logic to check the indentation level of the current line correctly.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and len(current_line.expandtabs()) < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False

        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            if current_line.strip() and len(current_line.expandtabs()) < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # adjust for tab width
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the function now correctly checks the indentation level of comments before deciding which lines to include in the result. The function now considers the tab width when evaluating the indentation levels provided by the column value. This modification ensures that the function handles comment indentation properly.
