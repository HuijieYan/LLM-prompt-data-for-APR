### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to process a prefix string and consume parts of it based on certain conditions. The bug is likely in the logic related to waiting for a new line character before processing further. In the failing test `test_comment_indentation`, the issue arises when handling comments.

### Issues in the Buggy Function
1. The condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` is incorrect because it does not consider counting the indentation levels properly.
2. The logic to handle indentation levels using spaces and tabs is not implemented correctly.
3. The handling of waiting for a newline character `wait_for_nl` is flawed, leading to incorrect behavior when encountering comments.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure accurate accounting of the indentation level by correctly updating `current_column` based on spaces and tabs.
2. Make corrections to the logic associated with `wait_for_nl` to handle comment lines properly.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line.rstrip())
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line.rstrip())
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

    return '\n'.join(lines), current_line
```

After implementing these corrections, re-run the failing test `test_comment_indentation` to ensure that it now passes successfully.
