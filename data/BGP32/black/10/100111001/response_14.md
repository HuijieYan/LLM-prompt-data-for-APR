### Explanation:
The bug is caused by the current implementation not correctly handling indentation levels within the prefix string. The function is intended to partially consume a prefix string until a certain column position is reached based on indentation. However, the current logic fails to properly handle different types of whitespace characters (spaces, tabs) and count their indentation levels.

### Bug:
The bug lies in how the function calculates the current column position based on different types of whitespace characters and tracks the indentation level within the prefix string.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to properly account for the indentation levels caused by spaces and tabs in the prefix string. We can achieve this by modifying how the current column is updated and checking for spaces and tabs in the correct order to accurately calculate the number of spaces for indentation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Calculate the number of spaces corresponding to the tab
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating how the current column is calculated for tabs, we can ensure that the function correctly handles indentation levels and partial consumption of the prefix string up to the specified column position.
