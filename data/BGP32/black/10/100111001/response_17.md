### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the incorrect handling of the characters in the prefix input. It fails to correctly handle cases where comments are present at the beginning of lines with different indentation levels. The function does not adjust the indentation correctly, leading to incorrect output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles the indentation levels and correctly consumes the prefix up to the specified column. Adjust the logic to account for different indentation types (spaces and tabs) and handle comment lines' indentation properly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # new line, reset the current column
                current_column = 0
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True

        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying the corrections to the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, it should now handle the indentation levels and consume the prefix correctly up to the specified column, addressing the bug identified.
