### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the condition where the function checks if the current character is a newline `char == '\n'`. It is incorrectly handling the case where the indentation ends with a comment line. 

When the function encounters a newline character after the comment in the prefix, it should include that line in the `lines` list and reset `current_line` to an empty string. However, due to the condition `(current_line.strip() and current_column < column)`, the current line (which is a comment line) is not added to the `lines` list, leading to the mismatch between expected and actual output in the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the condition for adding a line to `lines` should be modified. Instead of checking `current_line.strip()`, we can simplify the condition to only check that `current_column < column`. This change will ensure that the comment line is correctly included as part of the processed lines.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:  # Modified condition here
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the above change in the condition for adding a line to `lines`, the corrected version of the function should now correctly process the input prefix and pass the failing test.
