### Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is due to incorrect handling of indentation levels and new lines within the prefix string. The function is intended to partially consume the prefix string up to a certain column value. However, it fails to consider cases where there are multiple levels of indentation (tabs or spaces) and comments with different indentation levels mixed.

The function should stop consuming characters when it reaches the desired column and not consume characters within comments or additional indentation levels that exceed the target column.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the logic to correctly handle different levels of indentation and comments within the prefix string.
2. Ensure that the function stops consuming characters when the target column is reached, giving priority to maintaining the structure of prefix code.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    in_comment = False
    for char in prefix:
        if in_comment:
            current_line += char
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                in_comment = False
            continue

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '#':
            in_comment = True
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making these adjustments, the function should now correctly consume characters up to the specified column value without breaking the structure of the prefix code, including handling comments of various indentation levels.
