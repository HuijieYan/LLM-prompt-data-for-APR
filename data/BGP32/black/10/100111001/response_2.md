### Explanation of the issue:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not handling the case where the current line has trailing spaces or tabs before a newline character ('\n'). The function incorrectly checks the column number only when encountering a newline ('\n') character, leading to incorrect handling of indentation levels.

In the failing test `test_comment_indentation`, the expected output is not matching the actual output due to this incorrect handling of trailing spaces or tabs.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly considers trailing spaces or tabs before a newline character ('\n') when checking the column number. This will ensure that the correct indentation levels are maintained.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.rstrip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.rstrip():
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By using `rstrip()` on the current line before checking indentation levels and ensuring that 'wait_for_nl' is set to `True` when encountering a newline after trimming whitespaces, the function now correctly handles trailing spaces or tabs before newline characters.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test `test_comment_indentation`.
