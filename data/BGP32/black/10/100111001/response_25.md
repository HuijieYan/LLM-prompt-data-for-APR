### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function causes incorrect handling of indentation levels and newlines within the provided prefix. This results in the function failing to correctly consume and return the prefix up to a specified column.

The logic for determining when to return the consumed prefix is flawed. It fails to correctly track and handle different indentation levels, especially when encountering leading spaces, tabs, or newlines. This leads to discrepancies in the output compared to the expected result, causing the failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to accurately track and consume the prefix based on the column value provided. This involves properly managing the indentation levels and newlines within the prefix string.

1. Maintain a consistent tracking of the current column position while iterating over the characters in the prefix.
2. Adjust the logic for handling indentation (spaces and tabs) and newlines to correctly consume the prefix up to the specified column.
3. Make sure to return the consumed prefix correctly along with the remaining unparsed portion.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        if current_column >= column:
            break
        
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                break
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif not char.isspace():
            wait_for_nl = True

    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
``` 

By implementing this corrected version, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now accurately process the prefix string up to the specified column, resolving the bug and allowing it to pass the failing tests.
