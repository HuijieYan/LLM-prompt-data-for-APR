The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function stems from how it handles the indentation and comments in the input code. The function is designed to consume a prefix string until a certain column position within the code. However, it fails to handle comments properly, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

The issue arises when the function encounters a comment line within the prefix string. It incorrectly assumes that the comment is part of the indentation and tries to handle it as such. This leads to an incorrect comparison between the expected and actual results in the failing test cases, resulting in assertions failures.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic of how the function handles comments. Comments should not affect the indentation tracking within the prefix string. We can achieve this by modifying the logic related to comment handling.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    in_comment = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        if in_comment:
            if char == '\n':
                in_comment = False
            current_line += char
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            elif char == '#':
                in_comment = True
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By checking for comment indicators and correctly handling them, this updated function should now handle comments within the prefix string without affecting the indentation tracking. This should resolve the failing test cases related to comment indentation.
