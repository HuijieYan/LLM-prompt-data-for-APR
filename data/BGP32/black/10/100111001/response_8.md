The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to the handling of newline characters in the prefix. This bug leads to incorrect output in cases where there are comments followed by a newline character in the prefix.

The issue is that the code does not correctly handle the scenario where a comment is at the end of a line in the prefix and is followed by a newline character. The code checks if the character is a newline (`'\n'`) and proceeds to process the line. However, in the case where a comment is immediately followed by a newline, it incorrectly treats it as finishing the line prematurely.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the handling of newline characters so that comments followed by a newline are correctly included in the final output.

Here's a corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_column += 1
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures that comments followed by newline characters are correctly included in the output.

By using this fixed version of the function, the failing test `test_comment_indentation` provided previously should pass without any assertion errors.
