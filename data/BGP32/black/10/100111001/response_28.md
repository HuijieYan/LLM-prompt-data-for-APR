### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to how the function handles the case when a newline character `\n` is encountered. It incorrectly resets the `current_column` to 0 when encountering a newline, causing the function to not correctly process the indentation level of the code snippet passed.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `current_column` only resets to 0 when encountering a newline if it is part of the indentation sequence we are trying to consume. Otherwise, it should not reset the `current_column`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip():  # Check if the line is not empty before resetting current_column
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_column += 1  # Increment column count for newline within an indent
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the indentation levels and consume the prefix as expected.
