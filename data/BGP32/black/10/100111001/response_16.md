The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to how the function handles tab characters (`\t`). It does not account for the fact that a tab character should increment `current_column` by 1 tab width (4 spaces) and not just by 1.

### Error Cause:
The function increments `current_column` by 4 for each tab character encountered. However, in the case of an empty string before a tab character, the function should align `current_column` to the first tab column (1) instead of directly adding 4.

### Fix Strategy:
Modify the logic related to tab characters to correctly increment `current_column` based on the tab width. Ensure that the function correctly aligns the column index when encountering tab characters.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Calculate the column index for the first tab position
            tab_width = 4
            tab_modifier = tab_width - (current_column % tab_width)
            current_column += tab_modifier
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should handle tab characters correctly and align the column index appropriately when encountering them.
