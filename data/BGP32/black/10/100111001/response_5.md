### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to the incorrect calculation of the indent level when encountering comments in the prefix. The function fails to correctly adjust the current column position when a comment is encountered, leading to incorrect output.

In the failing test case `test_comment_indentation`, the function is called twice with different prefixes representing Python code with comments using different levels of indentation. However, due to the bug, the function fails to correctly adjust the column position when encountering comments, resulting in mismatched outputs between the expected and actual values.

The primary issue lies in the handling of comment lines inside the prefix. When a comment is encountered, the function should update the current column position by correctly accounting for the characters in the comment line. However, the current implementation fails to do so, leading to incorrect indentation levels.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to ensure that when a comment line is encountered, the current column position is adjusted correctly by considering the length of the comment line. Additionally, the logic for updating the indentation level after encountering comments needs to be revised to match the expected behavior in Python code.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.lstrip().startswith("#"):
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version includes an additional check for comment lines when encountering a newline character. If the current line starts with a "#" character (indicating a comment), it is added to the lines list without updating the current column position. This adjustment ensures that comments do not affect the indentation level calculation, addressing the issue in the original buggy function.
