### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` fails to correctly handle cases where comments are preceded by tabs and spaces causing incorrect line indentation. When encountering a comment after spaces, the function incorrectly expects an additional indentation level check before reading the comment line. This behavior disrupts the correct parsing of comments with mixed indentation styles, leading to test failures.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, it's essential to align the comment indentation logic with the comment detection logic, ensuring that comments are handled uniformly regardless of the preceding indentation. By removing unnecessary indentation checks and updating the logic for handling comments, the function can accurately parse the input while preserving the correct comment formatting.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == '\n':
            # Check for comment after any form of indentation
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By updating the logic to handle comments independent of preceding indentation levels in the corrected version of the function, it ensures consistent treatment of comments regardless of the indentation style used in the input code.
