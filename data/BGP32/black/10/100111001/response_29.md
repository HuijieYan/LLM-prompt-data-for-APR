### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of indentation levels, leading to incorrect column count.
2. Inconsistent response when encountering different characters like spaces, tabs, and newlines.
3. Failure to handle empty lines properly.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug stems from the function not correctly handling the logic for maintaining the correct column count when encountering different characters. This leads to misrepresentations of the original input with respect to indentation levels and line contents. The function fails to differentiate between spaces, tabs, and newlines appropriately, resulting in incorrect concatenation of lines and inaccurate tracking of the current column.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure accurate detection and handling of indentation levels.
2. Correctly respond to spaces, tabs, and newlines according to their significance.
3. Implement proper handling of empty lines to prevent undesired behavior.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By ensuring consistent handling of indentation levels and characters, the corrected function should now accurately process the given prefix and maintain the intended structure. This should resolve the failing test cases and prevent mismatched formatting issues.
