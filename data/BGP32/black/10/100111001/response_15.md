### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function when it encounters a '\n' character. If the condition `if char == '\n':` is met, it resets the `current_column` to 0 without checking if the line is already part of the prefix. This results in premature resetting of `current_column`, leading to incorrect prefix handling.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic that handles the '\n' character. We should check whether the current line is non-empty before resetting the `current_column` to ensure we don't reset it unnecessarily.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            continue

        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By making the above changes to the function, it should now handle the '\n' character correctly and pass the failing test cases.
