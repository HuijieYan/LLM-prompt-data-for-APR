### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix by lines. It constructs lines based on indentation values until a specific column is reached. The bug seems to occur when encountering a case where the input prefix includes indentation followed by a comment. The function fails to handle the case where the comment line has indentation more than the expected column value.

### Bug:
The bug arises due to a miscalculation in determining the proper indentation level when encountering comment lines. The function fails to correctly consider the actual indentation level of the comment line for comparison with the expected column value.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function accurately tracks the indentation level of comment lines, considering tabs and spaces, and compares it properly with the expected column value.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            current_line = ""
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            if char == '#':
                wait_for_nl = False

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version includes the additional condition to reset the current_line and wait_for_nl when encountering '\n' within a comment line. This adjustment ensures the correct handling of indentation levels for commented lines and resolves the bug.
