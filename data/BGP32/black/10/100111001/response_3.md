### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs because when the function encounters a '\n' character, it resets the `current_column` to 0 unconditionally. This behavior leads to incorrect indentation handling, especially when dealing with comments in the code.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the condition where `current_column` is reset to 0. This reset should only happen in certain specific cases, not every time a newline character is encountered.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n' and current_line.strip():
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By adding the condition `elif char == '\n' and current_line.strip():`, we only reset the `current_column` to 0 when encountering a newline character after a non-empty line. This change ensures correct handling of the indentation and addresses the bug in the original function.
