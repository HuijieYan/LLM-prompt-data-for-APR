### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from incorrectly checking if the current line should be added to the `lines` list when encountering a newline character. The logic for checking `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` is to determine if the indentation level of the comment matches the expected column. However, in the provided implementation, the check is done after adding the current line, leading to incorrect results. This causes the function to include lines with incorrect indentation levels in the output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for adding the current line when encountering a newline character. The correct approach is to check the indentation level before adding the current line to the `lines` list.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the logic to check indentation before adding the current line to `lines` when encountering a newline character, the corrected function should now produce the expected output and pass the failing test.
