### Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is caused by the incorrect logic related to handling indentation levels and waiting for newlines. The function fails to correctly consume the prefix up to the specified column while preserving the correct indentation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the function to properly handle the indentation levels, spaces, tabs, and newlines. Specifically, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies when to wait for a newline and handles spaces, tabs, and newlines appropriately.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line += char
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            elif char != '\r':
                wait_for_nl = True
                current_line += char
    
    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
        res = ''.join(lines)
        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
    lines.append(current_line)
    return ''.join(lines), ""
```

By adjusting the logic in the function as outlined above, the corrected version should now properly handle the indentation levels and newline waiting behavior, resolving the bug.
