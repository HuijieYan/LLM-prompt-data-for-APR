The bug in the provided function is that the condition to handle the indentation is not correctly set. The `wait_for_nl` flag is not updated correctly causing unexpected behaviors. 

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditions inside the loop to properly handle the indentation and newline characters. We should update the `wait_for_nl` flag based on the encountered characters.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column += 1  # increment column count for the current character
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle the indentation and newline characters correctly according to the expected cases provided.
