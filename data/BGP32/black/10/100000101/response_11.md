The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` occurs when the condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` is checked. This condition is meant to check if the current line has content and if the current column is less than the specified column. However, the current column is not updated correctly when encountering newline characters ('\n'), which results in an incorrect check and potential premature return from the function.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `current_column` is updated properly when encountering newline characters.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # update current_column correctly
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures that the `current_column` is properly updated when encountering newline characters, addressing the bug and allowing the function to behave correctly based on the expected input/output values provided for each case.
