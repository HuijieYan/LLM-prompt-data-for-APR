The issue in the provided function is that the condition to check if the current column is less than the specified column is not correctly applied, leading to incorrect output. 

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic within the `if char == '\n':` block. Instead of returning within this block, we should only append `current_line` to `lines` if the line is not empty and the column condition is met. Then, we reset `current_line` and `current_column` to continue processing the prefix.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:  # Adjusted condition
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should now satisfy all the expected input/output values for the provided test cases.
