The bug in the provided function lies in the condition where the function checks if a character in the prefix is a newline character. This condition should only be triggered after encountering white spaces or tabs that signal the end of an indentation block. However, the current implementation checks for a newline character after every character, leading to premature line breaks.

To fix this issue, we need to adjust the logic of when to check for a newline character. The newline check should occur after encountering spaces or tabs and not after every character.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            
        # moved the newline character check here to ensure it only happens after whitespaces or tabs
        # not after every character
        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0

        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should now behave as expected and produce the correct output for the provided test cases.
