The buggy function has an issue in handling the column calculation for '\t' characters, which causes incorrect column counting in some cases. To fix this bug, we need to adjust the column calculation for '\t' characters correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)  # Adjust column calculation for '\t'
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version includes the adjustment for the column calculation when encountering '\t' characters, ensuring that the column count behaves correctly. The function should now work as expected for all the provided test cases.
