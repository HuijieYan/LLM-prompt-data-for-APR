## Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix string based on the provided column value. However, there are some issues within the function that lead to incorrect behavior. The function has some logical errors in the condition checking for newline characters and indentation levels. 

## Bug
The primary bug in the function occurs during the handling of newline characters and the evaluation of the current column. When encountering a newline character, the function resets the `current_column` to 0, irrespective of the indentation level. This behavior results in incorrect consumption of the prefix string.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the handling of newline characters to consider the indentation level. The `current_column` should be updated according to the indentation level encountered before the newline character. This modification ensures that the function correctly consumes the prefix string based on the provided `column` value.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Adjust current_column based on the actual indentation level
            current_column = 0
            for c in current_line:
                if c == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif c == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                else:
                    break
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version of the function handles the newline characters correctly by updating the `current_column` based on the actual indentation level encountered before the newline. This adjustment ensures that the function consumes the prefix string properly according to the provided `column` value.
