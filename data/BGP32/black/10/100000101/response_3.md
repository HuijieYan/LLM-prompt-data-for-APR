The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the condition to check if the current line's length is less than the specified column. This condition is incorrect and leads to unexpected behavior. The function should check if the current column is less than the specified column instead.

To fix this bug, we need to update the condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` to `if current_column < column`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected function now properly checks if the current column is less than the specified column before returning the current line and the remaining prefix. This ensures the function behaves as expected in all scenarios mentioned in the test cases.
