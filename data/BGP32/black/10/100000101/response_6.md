The buggy function is intended to partially consume a prefix string based on the input 'column' value and return the consumed prefix along with the remaining prefix. However, there are issues with the logic in handling the newline character and updating the variables correctly.

The bug seems to be in the condition checking for newline characters and updating the variables 'wait_for_nl' and 'lines'. The current implementation does not properly handle cases where the column limit is not met before encountering a newline character.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling newline characters and resetting the variables accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, current_line

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, current_line
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should now properly handle all cases as specified in the expected values and types of variables during the failing test executions.
