The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has an issue where it incorrectly handles cases when waiting for a new line character and continuing to build the current line. The bug causes the function to terminate prematurely and not accurately consume the prefix.

The main issue lies in the condition where it checks for `wait_for_nl` to be True before processing the new line character. This causes unexpected behavior when encountering the new line character when it should be waiting for it and building the current line until the condition `current_column < column` is met.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic within the function to handle the new line character correctly and continue building the current line until the condition is satisfied.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version handles the cases where the new line character should be considered as part of the current line being built, ensuring the function consumes the prefix correctly according to the given specifications.
