The bug in the provided function stems from the logic handling the case when a newline character is encountered. The current implementation resets the `current_column` to 0 when a newline character is found, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic so that `current_column` only resets to 0 if we are waiting for a new line (`wait_for_nl` is True). In all other cases, `current_column` should increment based on the encountered character.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by properly handling the column count for newline characters.
