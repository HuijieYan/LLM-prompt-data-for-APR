The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the condition where the function checks for a newline character (`'\n'`) to determine when to split the prefix. However, this condition does not handle the case where the prefix ends without encountering a newline character. This results in the last line of the prefix not being included in the `lines` list.

To fix this bug, we need to update the code to handle the case where the prefix ends without a newline character, ensuring that the last line is also included in the `lines` list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    lines.append(current_line)  # Include the last line when prefix ends
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version will now include the last line of the prefix in the `lines` list when the prefix ends without encountering a newline character, fixing the bug mentioned earlier.
