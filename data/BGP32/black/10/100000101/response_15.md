The bug in the provided function is caused by failing to properly handle the case when the function encounters a '\n' character while waiting for a new line, resulting in incorrect line splitting and column calculation.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic of handling the '\n' character and update the current_column value accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column = 0  # Reset current_column for each new line
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by resetting the current_column value to 0 whenever a '\n' character is encountered while waiting for a new line, ensuring correct line splitting and column calculation.
