The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is related to how it handles the indentation. It fails to correctly update the `current_column` value when encountering a new line character or tabs. The issue arises when it tries to calculate the correct column value when moving to a new line.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic for calculating the `current_column` value when encountering different types of characters (spaces, tabs, new lines). We should reset the `current_column` value to 0 when encountering a new line character and adjust it accordingly for tabs.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should now handle the indentation and column values correctly based on the input prefix string. Testing with the expected cases provided should confirm that the function behaves as expected.
