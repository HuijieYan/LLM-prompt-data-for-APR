The bug in the provided function is in the condition where the function checks if the current column is less than the specified column. If the current column is not less than the specified column, the function should continue building the lines without stopping.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the condition within the `if` statement to correctly handle this case.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:  # Corrected condition
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_column += 1
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should now satisfy all the expected input/output values.
