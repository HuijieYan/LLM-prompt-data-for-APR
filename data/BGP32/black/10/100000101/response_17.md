The bug in the provided function is that the logic for handling the new line character ('\n') is not correctly updating the current column count and lines list. This leads to incorrect output in some scenarios.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic for updating the current column count and lines list when encountering a new line character. Specifically, in the case where wait_for_nl is True, we should update the current column count and lines list before resetting the current line.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:  # increment column count for each non-empty char
                current_column += 1
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should now handle the scenarios correctly as described in the expected cases.
