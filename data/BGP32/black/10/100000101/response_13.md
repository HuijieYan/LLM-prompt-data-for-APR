The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the condition to check for the completion of the indent. The `wait_for_nl` flag is set to `True` once an indent starts but should be reset only when a newline character is encountered after the completion of the indent.

To fix this bug, we need to reset the `wait_for_nl` flag only when a newline character is encountered after the completion of the indent. This can be achieved by moving the check for the newline character after the check for the completion of the indent.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

This corrected version of the function should now satisfy all the expected input/output values for the given test cases.
