The bug in the provided function `_partially_consume_prefix` is related to the handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag. It should be set to True when a whitespace character is encountered, not when an indent is finished.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the conditional statements to correctly update the `wait_for_nl` flag. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column += 1
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the incorrect setting of the `wait_for_nl` flag and should now satisfy all the expected input/output values provided.
