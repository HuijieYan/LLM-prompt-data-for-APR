## Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume the prefix string based on the given column value. However, there are several issues in the function that lead to incorrect behavior:
1. Inconsistent updating of `current_column` based on different characters.
2. Inadequate handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag.
3. Incorrect saving of the consumed lines in the `lines` list.

## Bug Explanation
1. The current implementation fails due to incorrect logic related to updating the `current_column` when encountering different characters. Specifically, the function wrongly adds 1 to `current_column` when encountering a space (' ') character, leading to an incorrect count.
2. The `wait_for_nl` flag is not properly handled. It is expected to be set to `True` when a non-space character is encountered, but in some cases, it is not set back to `False` when a newline character is encountered.
3. The implemented logic for saving consumed lines in the `lines` list is flawed. The lines are appended before checking the conditions related to the `column`, leading to incorrect results.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bugs in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, the following corrections need to be made:
1. Update the logic for `current_column` calculation to handle spaces (' ') and tabs ('\t') correctly.
2. Properly manage the `wait_for_nl` flag to switch between states correctly.
3. Modify the logic for saving consumed lines to ensure correct results.

## Corrected Function
Below is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
            if current_column <= column:
                wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By applying the fixes outlined above, the corrected function should now produce the expected results for each case provided.
