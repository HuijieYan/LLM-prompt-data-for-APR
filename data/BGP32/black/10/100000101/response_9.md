The bug in the provided function is in the condition for checking if the character is a newline character. The logic to update the current column and handle unexpected empty lines is incorrect, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

To fix the bug, the condition for checking if the character is a newline character should be moved outside the condition for checking if we are waiting for a newline character. This ensures that the current column is correctly updated regardless of the wait_for_nl status.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures that the current column is correctly updated and handles newline characters appropriately. It should now satisfy all the expected input/output values for the provided test cases.
