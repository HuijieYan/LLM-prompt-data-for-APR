The bug in the provided function is that it incorrectly handles cases where the prefix contains more columns than the specified column value. The function should consume characters until it reaches the correct column position, but it fails to do so in certain cases.

To fix this bug, we need to update the condition where we check if the current column is less than the specified column value. We should continue consuming characters until the correct column position is reached and only then return the result.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:  # Fixed condition to check if current_column is less than or equal to the specified column
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should now correctly handle cases where the prefix contains more characters than the specified column value and behave as expected for all the provided test cases.
