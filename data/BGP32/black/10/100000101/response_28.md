The issue in the provided function is that the condition to check if the current column is less than the target column is incorrect. This leads to premature termination of the function before parsing the complete prefix string.

To fix this bug, the condition within the `if char == '\n':` block needs to be updated to check if `current_column + 1` is less than `column` instead of just `current_column < column`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column + 1 < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line

```

This corrected version of the function should now correctly process the prefix string according to the specified column value in all the provided test cases.
