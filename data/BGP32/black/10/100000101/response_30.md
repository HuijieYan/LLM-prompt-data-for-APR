The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has a logical error in the way it handles the indentation level. When encountering a newline character, the function resets the `current_column` to 0 unconditionally, which causes it to lose track of the correct column information. This results in incorrect handling of indentation levels and unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic related to calculating the `current_column` properly based on different character inputs.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # new line ends the current indent, reset current_column unless it's whitespace
            current_column = 0 if char.isspace() else len(current_line) - len(current_line.lstrip())
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version properly handles the update of `current_column` after a newline character based on whether the newline is preceded by whitespaces or not. This ensures that the indentation levels are correctly maintained.
