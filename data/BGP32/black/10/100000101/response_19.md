### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume part of the `prefix` string based on the given `column` value and return the consumed portion and the remaining portion. However, there are inconsistencies in how the function handles indentation levels and newlines, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Bug Explanation
1. The function fails to correctly handle the case where the `column` value is greater than the initial indentation level of the prefix.
2. The function enters a state of waiting for a newline character when encountering an indent or tab, but it should also reset the `current_column` counter in this case.
3. The condition to handle an unexpected empty line is applied after checking for indentation, which can lead to incorrect behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the logic to properly handle cases where the `column` value is greater than the initial indentation level.
2. Ensure that the `current_column` counter is reset when encountering an indent or tab.
3. Adjust the logic to handle unexpected empty lines before processing indentation levels.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                wait_for_nl = False

        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should address the identified issues and satisfy the expected input/output values for all the provided test cases.
