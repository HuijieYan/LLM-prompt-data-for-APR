The bug in the provided function is related to the logic of handling spaces and tabs within the prefix string. The function incorrectly counts the spaces and tabs as part of the current line, leading to incorrect calculations of the current column. This causes issues in determining when to split the prefix string.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust how spaces and tabs are handled in the current_line and current_column calculations. Additionally, we need to ensure that the correct line splitting logic is implemented.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line += char
        elif char == ' ':
            if current_line or current_column < column:  # Skip leading spaces
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            if current_line or current_column < column:  # Skip leading tabs
                current_line += char
                current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version adjusts the handling of spaces and tabs to skip them when they are at the beginning of a line. It also properly resets the current line and column when encountering a newline character. This version should now satisfy all the expected input/output values provided for the different test cases.
