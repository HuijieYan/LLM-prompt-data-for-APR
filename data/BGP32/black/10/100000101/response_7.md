### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column number. It keeps track of the current line, column, and checks for tabs, spaces, and new lines to determine when to stop consuming the prefix.

### Bug
The bug in the existing function is that it does not handle the case where the prefix ends before reaching the specified column number. In such cases, it does not return the consumed prefix correctly.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that if the prefix ends before reaching the specified column number, we return the consumed prefix along with the remaining characters in the prefix.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column: 
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

This corrected version should address the bug by properly handling cases where the prefix ends before reaching the specified column number.
