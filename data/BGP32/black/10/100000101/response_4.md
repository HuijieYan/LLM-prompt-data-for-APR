The buggy function has a logic issue where it does not correctly handle cases where the prefix includes multiple lines. The `wait_for_nl` flag is not properly reset when encountering a newline character, leading to incorrect processing.

To fix the bug, we need to reset the `wait_for_nl` flag to `False` when encountering a newline character in order to correctly handle multi-line prefixes. Additionally, we need to ensure that the lines are correctly appended to the `lines` list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures that the `wait_for_nl` flag is properly reset when encountering a newline character in the prefix, allowing correct handling of multi-line prefixes.
