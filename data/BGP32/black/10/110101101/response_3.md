### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has a logic error in handling the tab (`'\t'`) character. When encountering a tab character, the function incorrectly increments the `current_column` value by 4 instead of 1. This leads to incorrect indentation calculations and causes the function to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the logic for handling the tab character should be corrected to increment the `current_column` by 1 instead of 4 when tab character is encountered.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By correcting the handling of the tab character, the function should now correctly calculate the indentation level and pass the failing test cases.
