### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is expected to consume characters from the input `prefix` until the specified `column` is reached, considering whitespace characters and newlines for indentation detection. However, the function fails to correctly handle the case where the indentation finishes in the middle of the line followed by a comment.

### Bug Explanation:
In Case 1 of the runtime values, when the input prefix is `'    # comment\n    '` and the column is `8`, the function fails to account for the comment present in the line. It incorrectly treats the comment line as an empty line after finishing the indentation. Consequently, the function returns an incomplete result.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the function to correctly handle cases where the indentation finishes in the middle of a line with a comment. We should ensure that the comment line is correctly processed and included in the result.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            if current_column < column:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making this modification, the function should now correctly handle scenarios involving indentation finishing in the middle of a line with a comment, ensuring that the result includes the comment line.
