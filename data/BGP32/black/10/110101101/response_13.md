### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string until a specific column is reached.
2. The function uses a conditional `wait_for_nl` to handle new lines and keep track of the current column.
3. The bug occurs when the function encounters a new line character while still waiting for the next non-space character. This results in unexpected behavior.
4. The function should correctly consume the prefix until the desired column is reached, handling spaces, tabs, and new lines appropriately.

### Bug Cause:
The function fails to handle the case where a new line character is encountered while waiting for the next non-space character. This causes incorrect decisions on whether to terminate the current line or continue adding characters to it.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic within the loop to correctly handle new lines while waiting for the next non-space character.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl and char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the adjustment to handle new lines correctly within the `if wait_for_nl` condition, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and return the expected values.
