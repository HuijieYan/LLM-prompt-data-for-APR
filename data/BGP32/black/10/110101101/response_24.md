The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has an issue with properly handling the indentation level when encountering comments. The function fails to adjust the current column correctly when encountering comments preceded by spaces or tabs. 

The root cause of the bug can be attributed to the logic within the `elif char == '\n':` block. The current column is reset to 0 without considering the indentation level of the previous line. This leads to incorrect column counting for subsequent lines.

To fix the issue, we need to adjust the logic within the `elif char == '\n':` block to correctly handle the indentation level by keeping track of the current indentation level and adjusting the column based on it.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    indentation = 0

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                indentation = 0
                for c in current_line:
                    if c == ' ':
                        indentation += 1
                    elif c == '\t':
                        indentation += 4
                
                if current_line.strip() and indentation < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version includes a new variable `indentation` to keep track of the current indentation level. The function now correctly calculates the indentation for each line and adjusts the column based on it. This should address the issue and make the function behave as expected for all cases.
