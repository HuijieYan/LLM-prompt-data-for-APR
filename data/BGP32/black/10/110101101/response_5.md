### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to split the input `prefix` string into lines based on the provided `column` parameter. However, there are issues with handling whitespace characters and newline characters that are causing the function to fail the test cases.

1. The function does not correctly handle the case when a newline character is encountered while waiting for a newline (`wait_for_nl = True`). This causes the current line to be incorrectly added to the `lines` list without considering the indentation level.

2. The function does not correctly handle the case when encountering a tab character (`'\t'`) while calculating the column position. It should increase the `current_column` by 4, but it only increases by 1, causing incorrect indentation calculations.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the issues in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to ensure that:
- When encountering a newline character while waiting for a newline, the current line is properly added to the `lines` list considering the column parameter.
- When encountering a tab character, the `current_column` is increased by 4 to account for the indentation level.

Let's provide a corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip():
                        if current_column < column:
                            res = ''.join(lines)
                            return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version addresses the issues with handling newline characters and tab characters, ensuring correct indentation calculation and line splitting based on the column parameter.
