### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix based on a given column value. However, the function fails to correctly handle cases where the column value is not aligned with the prefix indentation, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the function encounters indentation (spaces or tabs) while waiting for a newline character (\n) to mark the end of the expected line. If the indentation is finished before the newline, the function incorrectly sets `wait_for_nl = True`, causing it to wait for the next newline character even if the expected line has ended.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic of when to set `wait_for_nl = True` based on the alignment with the provided column value. Specifically, we should set `wait_for_nl = True` only when the current column is less than the target column, indicating that the expected line's indentation has finished.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                wait_for_nl = True
            current_column = 0
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By making sure to set `wait_for_nl = True` only when the current column is less than the target column, we can ensure correct handling of the prefix indentation and aligning with the provided column value.
