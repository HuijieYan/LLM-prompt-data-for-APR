### Bug Explanation:
The bug lies in the condition where the function checks if it should wait for a new line or not. The condition `wait_for_nl` is not properly handled to reset all relevant variables when encountering a newline character. This leads to incorrect tracking of the current position and line contents.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when a newline character is encountered, the function correctly resets the necessary variables to track the current line contents and position. Additionally, we need to ensure that the correct logic is applied to handle spaces, tabs, and newlines.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif wait_for_nl:
            if char != ' ' and char != '\t':
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By resetting `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl` properly when encountering a newline character and adjusting the conditions for spacing characters, the corrected function should now handle the indentation and new lines correctly.

Now, the function should pass the failing test cases provided.
