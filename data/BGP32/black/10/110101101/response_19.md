### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to handling the indentation levels and line breaks in the provided prefix text. The function fails to correctly detect the end of indentation and the start of the actual content in some cases, leading to incorrect output.

The main issue arises when encountering a space character or a tab character while processing the prefix. The function is supposed to wait until a newline character is seen to determine the actual content and consume the prefix up to the specified column. However, it fails to do this correctly in all scenarios.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to adjust the logic for handling spaces and tabs, ensuring that the function correctly identifies the end of indentation and waits for the next newline character to continue processing. Additionally, we should update the condition to compare if the current column position is less than the specified column value.

### Corrected Function:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these corrections, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now correctly handle the indentation levels and return the expected output for the provided prefix text in the test cases.
