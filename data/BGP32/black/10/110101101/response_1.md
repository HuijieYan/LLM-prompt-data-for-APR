### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:` might not be handling the indentation level correctly.
2. The handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag and the indentation level calculation could be problematic.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to stem from incorrect handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag and inconsistent calculations of the `current_column` variable. This results in incorrect indentation detection and line processing, leading to a failure in identifying and consuming prefixes properly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the indentation level is calculated correctly and that the `wait_for_nl` flag is appropriately toggled based on the type of character encountered. Additionally, we need to ensure that the condition for consuming the prefix is accurate.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if not char.isspace() or (char == '\t' and current_column % 4 == 0):
            wait_for_nl = True
        
        current_line += char
        if char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        
        if wait_for_nl and char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that the indentation level is correctly calculated and that the `wait_for_nl` flag is toggled appropriately. By making these adjustments, the function should now correctly consume prefixes based on the provided columns.
