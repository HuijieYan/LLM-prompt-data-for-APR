### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the incorrect handling of indentation levels when encountering comments in the input prefix. The function is supposed to consume whitespace characters until a newline character is encountered after the comment to ensure proper indentation levels are maintained. However, the logic inside the `wait_for_nl` block is flawed, which leads to incorrect behavior.

Specifically, when a comment is encountered, the function correctly sets `wait_for_nl` to True to wait for a newline character. But when the newline character is encountered, the function incorrectly checks if the `current_column` is less than the specified `column`. This check should be based on where the comment ends, not when the newline character appears. This leads to premature line separation and incorrect indentation levels.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle comment indentation by ensuring that the `current_column` is only compared to the specified `column` after the comment's end. This means the function should continue consuming characters until the comment is fully parsed, then check the indentation level. Only at that point should the function decide whether to separate the lines.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    # Check indentation after the comment
                    if current_column < column:
                        lines.append(current_line)
                        lines_str = ''.join(lines)
                        return lines_str, prefix[len(lines_str):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the above changes to the function, it should now correctly handle comment indentation and pass the failing test cases.
