### Explanation:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not correctly handling the indentation logic. It fails to properly consume the prefix based on the specified column position and incorrectly handles certain characters like tabs and spaces. This leads to incorrect parsing of the input prefix string, causing the function to return unexpected values.

### Bug:
The bug occurs when the function encounters whitespace characters such as spaces and tabs. It leads to incorrect calculation of the `current_column` and the behavior of waiting for a new line (`wait_for_nl`). This results in the function failing to correctly consume the prefix up to the specified column.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the logic for handling spaces and tabs to correctly adjust the `current_column`.
2. Ensure that the function correctly waits for a new line based on the specified column.
3. Adjust the logic for building and returning the consumed prefix.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            continue

        if char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making these adjustments in the corrected version, the function should now correctly consume the prefix up to the specified column position, allowing it to pass the failing test cases.
