### Explanation of the bug

The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from incorrect handling of whitespace characters, specifically tabs and spaces. When the function encounters a tab character, it incorrectly increments the `current_column` by 4 instead of 1. This leads to misalignment with the expected column position, causing the function to return incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the increment of `current_column` for tab characters to 1 instead of 4. This will align the column position correctly and ensure that the function returns the expected results.

### Corrected Version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` Function

```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making this adjustment, the function will now correctly handle tabs as incrementing the column position by 1, aligning it with the expected behavior and fixing the bug.
