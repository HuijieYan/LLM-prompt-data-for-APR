### Analysis:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to the condition for handling indentation and the logic for updating the `current_column` variable. The function fails to correctly track the current column position when encountering whitespace characters like spaces and tabs.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function incorrectly increments `current_column` without considering the actual number of spaces or tabs encountered. This leads to incorrect behavior when checking the indentation level against the specified `column` value.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for incrementing the `current_column` variable based on the number of spaces or tabs encountered. This correction will ensure that the function correctly tracks the current column position.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By correcting the logic for updating the `current_column` variable based on the actual number of spaces or tabs encountered, the function should now correctly handle the indentation check and return the expected results for the given test cases.
