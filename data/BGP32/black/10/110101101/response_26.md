### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix based on a given column number. The bug seems to be related to the handling of whitespace characters such as space and tabs, resulting in incorrect column counting and premature prefix consumption.

### Issues:
1. The function fails to correctly handle the tab character ('\t') when counting columns.
2. There is an issue with the logic of waiting for a new line before consuming the prefix.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Correct the column counting logic to properly handle tab characters.
2. Adjust the logic for waiting for a new line before consuming the prefix.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = ((current_column // 4) + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the logic of column counting for tabs and correcting the waiting for newline logic, the corrected function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values provided.
