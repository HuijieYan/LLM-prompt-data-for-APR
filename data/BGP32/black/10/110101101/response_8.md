### Bug Explanation

The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume characters from a prefix string until a certain column width is reached based on spaces, tabs, and newlines. However, there are several issues causing it to fail. 

1. The condition to check for an empty line (`char == '\n'`) resets the `current_column` counter regardless of whether it's needed.

2. The logic around tracking indentation level and waiting for a newline is flawed, leading to incorrect consumed prefix and leftover prefix strings.

3. The function does not correctly handle the scenario where the desired column width is not reached within the prefix string.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly track indentation levels based on spaces and tabs, handle newlines correctly, and correctly return the consumed prefix and the leftover prefix string. 

1. Resetting `current_column` when encountering a newline should only happen if there is actual content on the line.
2. Adjust logic around tracking the indentation level and waiting for a newline to ensure correct prefix consumption.
3. Include handling for cases where the desired column width is not reached within the prefix string.

### Corrected Function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line += char
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True

    lines.append(current_line)
    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
``` 

This corrected function should now properly consume the prefix based on the desired column width and handle all the scenarios described in the failing test cases.
