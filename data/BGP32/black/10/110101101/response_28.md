### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs because the logic to handle indentation levels is incorrect. The `wait_for_nl` flag is not being properly reset when encountering a newline character, leading to unexpected behavior when parsing the input prefix.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `wait_for_nl` flag is reset correctly whenever a newline character is encountered. We should also update the logic to correctly handle the indentation level based on spaces and tabs in the input prefix.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Driver:
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the corrected logic above, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function addresses the bug by properly handling the indentation levels and resetting the `wait_for_nl` flag when encountering newline characters. This should now pass the failing test cases provided.
