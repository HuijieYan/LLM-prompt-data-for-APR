### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` fails to correctly handle the prefix string to consume spaces or tabs until a newline character is encountered. The logic for updating the `current_column` and determining when to add lines is flawed.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In Case 1, the function fails to correctly consume the prefix string until a newline character is encountered. The `current_column` is incorrectly calculated, resulting in an incorrect prefix truncation.
2. In Case 3, the function fails to properly handle the tab character, and the `current_column` is not updated according to the number of spaces equivalent to a tab character.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the logic to correctly handle the column calculation based on spaces and tabs.
2. Ensure that the function properly consumes the prefix string until a newline character is found.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                  wait_for_nl = True
            
            current_line += char
    
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

The corrected function implements the necessary logic adjustments to handle spaces, tabs, and newline characters properly. This version should now pass the failing test cases and meet the expected input/output values.
