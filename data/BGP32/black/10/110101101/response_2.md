### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs because the conditional check for `wait_for_nl` is not correctly triggering the processing of newlines. This results in incorrect line concatenation and column tracking, leading to incorrect output.

### Bug Location
The issue lies in how the `wait_for_nl` flag is being handled within the loop. The logic to check if a newline character is encountered while waiting for one is incorrect.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic that handles the `wait_for_nl` flag to correctly reset line variables when encountering newline characters. Additionally, we need to adjust the conditions for updating the `current_column` and `current_line` variables.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
        else:
            if char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By making these adjustments to the logic, the function should now correctly process the prefix input and return the expected output for the test cases provided.
