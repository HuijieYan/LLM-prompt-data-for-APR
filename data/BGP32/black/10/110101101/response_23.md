### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a specific prefix based on a given column indentation. However, the logic inside the function seems to be incorrect, leading to failing tests.

### Bug:
The bug in the function occurs when the current indentation exceeds the specified column value. In such cases, the function should stop the consumption of the prefix and return the consumed part only. However, the code fails to handle this scenario correctly, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic that determines when to stop consuming the prefix based on the column value. We should ensure that the function correctly returns the consumed part of the prefix up to the specified column and any leading whitespace/tabs should be ignored for the current line.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic to check if the current column is less than or equal to the specified column, the corrected function should now handle the scenario as expected and pass the failing tests.
