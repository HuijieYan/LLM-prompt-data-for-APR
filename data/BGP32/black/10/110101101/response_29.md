### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string until a certain column is reached while handling indentation correctly.
2. In the failing test `test_comment_indentation`, the function fails to correctly consume the prefix string according to the provided column.
3. Based on the runtime values and types of variables, the function fails to handle the cases where the indentation level changes abruptly within the string.
4. The bug is mainly caused by improper tracking of the current column position and handling of whitespace characters.
5. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic inside the function to correctly handle different types of characters like spaces, tabs, and newlines.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Correctly track the current column position while consuming the prefix.
2. Implement proper checks for different types of characters (spaces, tabs, newlines) to handle indentation changes.
3. Update the logic to detect when a new line starts and adjust the current column and state accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if current_column >= column:
            return ''.join(lines), current_line + prefix[prefix.index(char):]
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying the above corrections to the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, it should now pass the failing test and correctly handle the given prefix strings based on the specified column limit.
