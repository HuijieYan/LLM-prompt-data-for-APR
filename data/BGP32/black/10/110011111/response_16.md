## Analysis
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to consume a prefix string until a certain column position is reached based on the indentation rules. However, there seems to be a logic error in handling the characters of the prefix string, especially when encountering tab characters and spaces. This leads to incorrect handling of indentation, resulting in failing tests.

### Error Locations
1. The calculation of the `current_column` value based on tab and space characters is incorrect.
2. Handling of newline characters and indentation levels is mixed up, leading to improper processing.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug stems from the mishandling of tab characters and spaces while calculating the `current_column` for indentation. This causes inconsistencies in tracking the correct column position, leading to improper handling of comments after dedent levels.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, consider adjusting the logic to handle tab characters properly in updating the `current_column`. Additionally, ensure that newlines are appropriately processed to maintain the correct indentation levels.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        # Handle tabs appropriately
        if char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        else:
            current_column += 1
        
        current_line += char
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ' and current_column >= column:
            wait_for_nl = True
        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset column count after a newline
            current_column = 0
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Correction
The corrected version of the function adjusts the handling of tab characters to update the `current_column` correctly. It also ensures that the `wait_for_nl` flag is set based on the correct conditions for newline and indentation. This fix should address the bug and pass the failing tests.
