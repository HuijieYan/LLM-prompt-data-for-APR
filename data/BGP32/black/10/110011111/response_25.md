### Bug Explanation

The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a part of a prefix up to a specified column value. However, there is a bug in the function logic where the comment lines are not correctly handled in terms of indentation. This results in incorrect handling of comments after dedenting, leading to the failing test case related to comment indentation.

In particular, the issue arises when encountering a newline character while waiting for a newline (wait_for_nl == True) after an indent. The current implementation does not properly handle the indentation for comment lines, causing the error in the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix this bug, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` needs to be modified to correctly handle comment lines after dedenting. Specifically, after correctly indenting lines, comments should be aligned with the correct level of indentation, similar to the code lines.

### Corrected Version of the Function

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Handle dedenting for comment lines
            if current_line.strip().startswith("#") and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version includes proper handling for comment lines after dedenting, ensuring that the comment indentation aligns with the code lines as expected. This should address the issue reported in the failing test related to comment indentation.
