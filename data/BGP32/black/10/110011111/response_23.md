To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to ensure that the indentation of comments is maintained correctly after a dedent. The issue arises from incorrect handling of spaces and tabs and the logic to handle the comment indentation.

The root cause of the bug is the improper logic to handle comments' indentation after dedenting. The function incorrectly processes the whitespace characters, leading to incorrect comment indentation when a dedent occurs. The logic to wait for a newline before processing the comment indentation was flawed, causing the issue.

To address this bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling comments and whitespace characters to preserve correct indentation. Updating the conditional checks for spaces, tabs, newlines, and comments will ensure that the function accurately retains the comment indentation after dedenting.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
# The corrected buggy function
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the indent logic to properly handle spaces and tabs after dedenting, this corrected version of the function should now preserve the correct comment indentation.

This fix should resolve the indentation issue with tabulated comments after a dedent as described in the GitHub issue.
