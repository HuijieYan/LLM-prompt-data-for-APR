### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of indentation levels when encountering comments after dedentations. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` fails to maintain the correct indentation level for comments after dedents, resulting in an incorrect output where the comment indentation does not match the code indentation. This bug is evident from the mismatch in indentation seen in the failing test case.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` needs to correctly handle the indentation levels for comments that follow dedentations to ensure that the comment indentation aligns correctly with the code. This involves adjusting the logic that tracks the current column and checks for newlines to maintain the correct indentation level for comments.

### Corrected Function:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if not current_line.strip():
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                else:
                    current_column = 0
            else:
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying this fix, the function should handle the indentation correctly for comments after dedentations, aligning them properly with the code. This corrected version should pass the failing test case and address the indentation issue reported in the GitHub post.
