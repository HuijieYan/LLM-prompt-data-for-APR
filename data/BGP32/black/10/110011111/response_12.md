### Bug Explanation:

The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to process a prefix string to determine the appropriate formatting. The issue arises when the function encounters a comment while processing the prefix, mishandling the indentation of the comment.

The main cause of the bug is the inaccurate handling of indentation levels and the presence of comments in the prefix. When a comment is encountered in the prefix, the function incorrectly resets the `current_column` and does not adjust the comment's indentation properly, leading to incorrect formatting.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling comments and indentation levels when encountered in the prefix. Specifically, the function should accurately track the indentation level and adjust comments accordingly while processing the prefix.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char.isspace() and char != '\n':
                current_column += 4 if char == '\t' else 1
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
                
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the handling of whitespace characters and adjusting the indentation level calculation, the corrected version of the function should now accurately process prefixes with comments and maintain the correct indentation levels.
