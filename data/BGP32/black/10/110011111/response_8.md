### Bug Explanation:

The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from how the function handles processing characters where indentation changes (spaces, tabs) and newlines. When encountering a non-space/tab character after an indentation change, the function incorrectly sets `wait_for_nl` to `True`, expecting a newline to follow to end the current line. However, the condition that triggers the appending of the current line to the `lines` list is flawed, causing the comment indentation issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix the bug, we need to address the incorrect handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag and the condition for appending the current line to the `lines` list. The logic should properly handle changing and maintaining indentation levels based on different characters encountered.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the condition where a newline is encountered and correctly resetting the variables related to line processing, the corrected function should now handle the expected comment indentation scenarios and pass the failing test case.
