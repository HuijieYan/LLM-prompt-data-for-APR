### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` fails to correctly handle the indentation of comments when they follow a dedent operation. The issue arises due to the logic checking for newline characters being misplaced within the loop, resulting in incorrect handling of comment indentation.

In Case 1, the function fails to correctly process the provided prefix `'    # comment\n    '` with a column value of 8. It erroneously ends up not adjusting the indentation of the comment line following a dedent operation, as represented by `res` being an empty string instead of the expected `'    # comment\n'`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To address this bug, the logic within `_partially_consume_prefix` needs to be modified to handle the indentation of comments correctly following a dedent operation. By adjusting the position of the check for newline characters and reevaluating indentation levels appropriately, the function can be fixed.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            current_line += char
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the order of operations and ensuring the newline check is in the correct location within the loop, the corrected function should now handle the indentation of comments following a dedent operation accurately. This fix aims to align with the expected behavior and address the reported issue on GitHub.
