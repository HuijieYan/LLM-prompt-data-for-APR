### Bug Explanation

The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is causing incorrect behavior when handling the indentation of comments. The issue arises when the function encounters a newline character `'\n'` within the prefix string. In the buggy code, when encountering a newline character, the current column is always reset to 0. This causes a discrepancy in the indentation level for comments compared to the expected output.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic inside the `for` loop that iterates over the characters in the prefix string. When encountering a newline `'\n'`, we should maintain the current column unless the line is empty. This adjustment will ensure that the correct column is used for subsequent characters in the prefix, including comments.

### Corrected Version

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    current_column += 1
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                wait_for_nl = True
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making these adjustments to the logic inside the function, the corrected version should now handle the indentation of comments correctly, passing the failing test case and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
