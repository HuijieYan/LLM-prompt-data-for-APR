### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function where the indentation is incorrect for comments following a dedent, specifically when dealing with tabs as indentation characters. The logic inside the function does not handle tab characters correctly, leading to an incorrect detection of the end of indentation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic related to tab characters in the function `_partially_consume_prefix`. Specifically, we should adjust the calculation of `current_column` when encountering tab characters and ensure that the function correctly handles these characters for determining the end of indentation.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            current_line += char
            spaces_needed = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_line += " " * spaces_needed
            current_column += spaces_needed
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

This corrected version properly handles tab characters and adjusts the indentation logic for comments following a dedent. It should resolve the bug described in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
