### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming a prefix of text based on certain conditions including indentation levels. The function seems to have an issue with handling tab characters and adjusting the column count appropriately.

### Error Cause:
The error occurs because the function does not properly handle the tab character (`\t`) when calculating the column positions. This leads to incorrect indentation levels, especially when dealing with tabulated comments after a dedent.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the column count is correctly adjusted when encountering tab characters. The function should properly handle tabs to align with the expected behavior described in the failing test cases and the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version explicitly considers tab characters and adjusts the column count accordingly, ensuring the proper indentation handling. It should now correctly address the tabulation issue described in the failing test cases and the GitHub issue.
