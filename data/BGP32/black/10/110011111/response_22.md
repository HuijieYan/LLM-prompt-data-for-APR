### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to handling indentation levels correctly when encountering comments while consuming a prefix of text. The issue arises when the function encounters comment lines after an indentation change that should maintain the same indent level as the previous line. This misalignment results in incorrect behavior where comments are wrongly indented compared to the surrounding code.

The key problem lies in the logic that attempts to handle waiting for a new line after detecting an indentation change. This logic does not correctly handle the case where a comment follows an indent, leading to incorrect behavior in maintaining the proper indentation level for subsequent lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to handle comment lines correctly after detecting an indentation change. The logic for determining the correct indentation level needs to be revised to ensure that comments are correctly aligned with the surrounding code.

### Corrected Function Implementation
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res)-1:]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures that the indentation level is properly maintained for comments occurring after an indent, resolving the bug identified by the failing tests and the related GitHub issue.
