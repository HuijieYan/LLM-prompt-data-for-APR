### Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is that when a newline character `\n` is encountered, the `current_column` is not reset to 0 correctly. This leads to incorrect handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag and causes unexpected behavior in handling comments with different levels of indentation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Reset the `current_column` to 0 every time a newline character is encountered.
2. Update the logic to handle the `wait_for_nl` flag accurately.
3. Adjust the appending of lines to correctly form the result string.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False

        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

Now, with the corrected version of the function, the logic for handling indentation and comments should work correctly, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
