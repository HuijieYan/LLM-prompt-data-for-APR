### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to handle indentation, particularly in the context of comments, in Python code.
2. The function processes each character in the input `prefix` string, updating variables to track the current column, lines, and indicating if it is waiting for a new line.
3. The issue arises when encountering a newline character after a specific indent level.
4. The function fails to correctly handle the scenario where there are tabs and spaces mixed as indentation.
5. The buggy behavior results in incorrect handling of comments' indentation after dedent, leading to test failures and an undesirable output.
6. The GitHub issue describes a similar problem related to incorrect comment indentation after a dedent using tabs.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of mixed indentation (spaces and tabs) when processing the input prefix string. It fails to accurately track the current column position, leading to incorrect behavior when encountering newlines after a certain level of indentation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the function to properly track and handle mixed indentation (tabs and spaces).
2. Adjust the logic to accurately determine the column position after each character, especially when dealing with a combination of tabs and spaces.
3. Ensure that comments retain correct indentation alignment relative to the code lines.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Determine the appropriate number of spaces to add based on current position
            spaces_to_add = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_column += spaces_to_add
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By incorporating the suggested modifications to handle mixed indentation using spaces and tabs, the corrected version of the function should now correctly process the prefix string, maintaining the expected indentation for comments and resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
