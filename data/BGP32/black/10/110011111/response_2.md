### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to handle string prefixes by consuming characters until a certain column position is reached or an empty line is encountered. However, it fails to correctly handle tab characters, resulting in incorrect indentation.
2. The function has issues identifying tab characters and calculating the correct column position.
3. In the failing test case, the function fails to maintain the correct indentation for comments after a dedent with tabs, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual output.
4. To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle tab characters and adjust the column calculation accordingly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the function to properly handle tab characters by ensuring they are accounted for in the column calculation.
2. Adjust the logic to correctly handle indentation when encountering tab characters or changes in indentation levels.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Adjust for tab equivalent spaces
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the adjustments specified above, the corrected function should now correctly handle tab characters and maintain proper indentation levels, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
