### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` processes a given prefix string, trying to handle indentation correctly while processing comments and line breaks.
2. The function tracks the current line, column, and whether it's expecting a new line. It encounters issues with maintaining correct indentation for comments in specific scenarios.
3. The failing test highlights an error where the comment indentation is changed incorrectly after dedenting, resulting in a failed assertion due to incorrect formatting.
4. The bug arises when the function incorrectly handles processing the input prefix string, leading to incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent.
5. To fix the bug, the function should appropriately handle the scenario of encountering comments within the prefix string and ensure correct indentation levels are preserved.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the function's incorrect handling of comments and indentation, particularly after dedent operations, leading to incorrect comment indentation.

### Bug Fix:
To address the bug, the function needs to revise the logic for handling comments and indentation within the prefix string, ensuring that comments retain the correct indentation relative to the code.

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)  # Move this line here to handle comments correctly
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Updated Function Explanation:
The corrected function necessitates moving the line addition within the `elif char == '\n':` block to ensure that lines containing comments are correctly preserved with the intended indentation level. This adjustment should resolve the issue of incorrect comment indentation post dedent operations.
