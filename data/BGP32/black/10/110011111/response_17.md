### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a portion of the prefix string until a newline character is reached and meet certain conditions. The issue arises due to incorrect tracking of columns and line breaks when processing the prefix string.

In cases where the function encounters spaces, tabs, or newline characters, the column count is updated. However, the conditions for handling these characters are not aligned properly, leading to incorrect behavior. This results in incorrect consumption of the prefix string and incorrect handling of columns and line breaks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, the logic for updating the `current_column` and handling different characters (`' '`, `'\t'`, `'\n'`) needs to be adjusted to correctly determine the state of the current line and when to wait for a newline character.

One approach to fix this bug is to ensure that the conditions to update the `current_column`, check for newline characters, and handle the transition between lines are correctly set. This involves properly updating the `wait_for_nl` flag and handling the special cases of spaces, tabs, and newlines in the prefix string.

### Corrected Function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the conditions for updating `current_column`, handling newline characters, and managing the line transition, the corrected function should now correctly consume the prefix string and handle column and line tracking as expected.
