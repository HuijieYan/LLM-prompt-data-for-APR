### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function where the intended behavior is to handle the indentation of lines with tabs correctly. The issue arises when `wait_for_nl` is set to `True` indicating that the function is expecting a new line character, but it doesn't handle the case where a tab character is encountered. This leads to incorrect handling of indentation after a dedent when using tabs in the input.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when the function encounters a tab character while `wait_for_nl` is `True`, it correctly adjusts the column count and determines the next step by including the tab's impact on the column position.

### Corrected Code
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected code ensures that when encountering a tab character, it correctly aligns the column position based on the current column's value and the width of a tab. This adjustment allows for proper handling of indentation after dedents when using tabs in the input, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
