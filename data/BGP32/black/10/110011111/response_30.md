### Explanation of the Bug:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in how it handles the indentation tracking. When encountering a non-space character, it sets `wait_for_nl` to `True`, indicating that it is waiting for a new line to manage the indentation. However, when the function encounters a newline character, it sets `wait_for_nl` to `False` immediately, preventing the correct tracking of the indentation level.

This mishandling of the `wait_for_nl` flag leads to incorrect indentation management, causing the issue seen in the failing test cases where comments are not aligned correctly after a dedent operation.

### Proposed Fix:
To address this bug, the function should maintain the `wait_for_nl` state until the indentation has been correctly updated. By ensuring that the `wait_for_nl` flag remains `True` until the necessary indentation adjustments have been made, we can fix the bug and align the comments correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                elif char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By maintaining the `wait_for_nl` flag until the correct moment to reset it, the corrected function should now handle the indentation correctly and align comments properly after a dedent operation, resolving the reported GitHub issue and passing the failing test cases.
