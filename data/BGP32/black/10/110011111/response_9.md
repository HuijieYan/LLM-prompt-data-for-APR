### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function and Class Relationship**:
   - The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is a method of the `Driver` class.
   - It aims to process the prefix text, managing the indentation and line breaks based on the provided column value.

2. **Error Location**:
   - The error occurs in the condition related to `wait_for_nl` where the comment indentation might not align correctly with the next line's indentation.

3. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - In the failing tests provided, the bug arises when there is a comment after an indented block.
   - The function fails to correctly place the comments at the expected indentation level leading to a mismatch in the output.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**:
   - Adjust the logic inside the function to ensure proper handling of the comment indentation after dedents.
   - Update the function to correctly track and apply the required indentation for comments.

### Bug-fixed Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    current_line = " " * column + current_line.lstrip()
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    if current_line and wait_for_nl:
        if current_column < column:
            current_line = " " * column + current_line.lstrip()
    return "".join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic inside `_partially_consume_prefix`, specifically handling the comment indentation after dedents, the corrected version should now align comments as expected and resolve the bug.
