### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is used to consume up to a certain column in a prefix string, provided as input. It handles spaces, tabs, and newlines while tracking the current line and column.
2. The bug seems to be related to maintaining proper indentation before comments after a dedent operation, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.
3. Based on the runtime input/output values and expected input/output values, the bug occurs when the function incorrectly handles the indentation of comments after a dedent, leading to the assertion error in the failing test.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation of comments based on the provided column value and also maintains consistency with the input formatting.

### Bug Fix:
I will adjust the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent operation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                 if current_column < column and not current_line.isspace():
                     res = ''.join(lines)
                     return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By modifying the logic to consider the column value and the indentation before comments, the corrected function should now handle the indentation correctly and pass the failing test.
