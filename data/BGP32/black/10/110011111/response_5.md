### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is supposed to handle indentations and partially consume a prefix based on a given column value. The bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of whitespace characters, especially when dealing with comments.

1. The function incorrectly resets `current_column` to 0 if it encounters a newline character, which disrupts the proper calculation of the current column position.
2. The logic to handle waiting for a new line (`wait_for_nl`) seems faulty and might cause premature skips or concatenations of lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the column position is correctly updated for each character processed. Additionally, the handling of newlines and waiting for a new line needs to be adjusted to properly handle comments and preserve correct indentations.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    current_column += 1
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_column > 0:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version addresses the issues by properly updating the current column position for each character, correctly handling newlines to maintain proper line concatenation, and ensuring correct waiting logic for new lines. This version should fix the bug and address the test failures reported in the GitHub issue.
