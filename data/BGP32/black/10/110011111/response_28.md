## Correction:

The issue arises from the implementation of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function where the conditions for handling different characters like spaces, tabs, and newlines are causing incorrect behavior, especially for tabulated comments.

The function fails to correctly handle the column alignment of comments following an indented line. To fix this issue, we need to adjust how the function processes comments after dedents.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False

        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Assumed tab size is 4 spaces
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip().startswith('#'):
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
                    if current_column < column:
                        empty_space = ' ' * (column - current_column)
                        current_line += empty_space
                        current_column = column
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, we have added a check to properly adjust the column alignment when encountering a comment following an indented line. If the comment is identified, it appends it to the lines directly with proper indentation.

These adjustments should resolve the issue and align comments correctly following dedents.
