### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for incorrectly handling the indentation level after encountering a comment.
2. The function fails to maintain the correct indentation level for comments after a dedent, causing the tests to fail.
3. The issue is due to the improper tracking of the column position and handling of tabs and spaces in the input code.
4. The function needs to correctly update the column position while processing the prefix and preserve the correct indentation for comments.
5. The failing test case reveals the discrepancy in the expected and actual formatting of comments after a dedent, highlighting the bug in the function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Track the column position accurately while iterating over the prefix characters, considering spaces and tabs individually.
2. Update the logic to handle comments' indentation correctly, ensuring they align properly with the code at the same level.
3. Adjust the conditional checks to account for different scenarios, such as encountering spaces, tabs, newlines, or comments.
4. Refactor the function to maintain the correct state for column position and indentation tracking during prefix consumption.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False

        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By implementing these changes, the corrected function should now handle the indentation of comments properly after a dedent, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue and passing the failing test cases.
