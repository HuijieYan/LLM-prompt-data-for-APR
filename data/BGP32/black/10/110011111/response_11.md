### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a part of a given prefix up to a certain column limit. However, it fails to handle correct indentation for comments following a dedent. The issue is evident from the failing test related to comment indentation.

### Bug Identification
The bug arises due to the incorrect handling of the indentation level after dedent, especially for comments. The variable `current_column` fails to track the correct column number, leading to incorrect prefixes being returned.

### Bug Explanation
In the failing test case, when the prefix contains a comment that follows a dedent, the function misinterprets the indentation. It does not correctly update `current_column` after a dedent, leading to improper output. Since the function relies on proper column tracking, any deviation results in incorrect prefix consumption.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure correct tracking of the column number, especially after dedents. This involves updating the `current_column` when encountering dedents or newlines. Additionally, the logic for handling comments after dedents needs improvement to maintain the correct prefix.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = False  # Updated to handle correct indentation after dedents
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the code to track and handle column numbers correctly after dedents and adjust the logic for comments, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases related to comment indentation.
