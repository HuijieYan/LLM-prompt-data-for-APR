### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs when the function encounters a tab character `'\t'` in the input `prefix`. The logic to handle tabs is incorrect, leading to the incorrect handling of indentation levels, especially with regard to comments. This results in an incorrect prefix extraction process, causing the failing tests as described in the error message.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the logic for handling tab characters needs to be adjusted to correctly calculate the column indentation based on tabs in the input `prefix`. This adjustment ensures that the function correctly determines the column value for proper prefix extraction.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\t':
                tab_size = 4 - (current_column % 4)
                current_line += ' ' * tab_size
                current_column += tab_size
            else:
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1

            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version adjusts the tab handling logic to correctly calculate the column value and ensures that the function processes the input prefix accurately, addressing the bug reported in the failing tests.
