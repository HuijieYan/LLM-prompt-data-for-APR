### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is incorrectly handling the indentation of comments after dedents. The function is not correctly identifying the correct column to maintain the indentation of the comments while dedenting the code.

### Bug Location
The issue arises when the function encounters a comment that should maintain the same level of indentation as the following code line after a dedent operation.

### Bug Cause
The `wait_for_nl` variable is set to `True` when the function detects an indent in the code. However, it fails to consider the correct column position for comments after dedents, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic surrounding the detection of comment indentation after dedents. The function should properly identify the correct column position when handling comments.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should handle the indentation of comments correctly after dedents, fixing the bug and resolving the failing test case.
