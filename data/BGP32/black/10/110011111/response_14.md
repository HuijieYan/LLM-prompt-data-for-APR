Based on the analysis of the code, the issue seems to be related to the handling of comments and indentation. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to process a prefix string, preserving the indentation level until a newline is encountered. However, the conditional logic regarding the indentation level and waiting for newline characters seems to be incorrect, leading to incorrect output.

The cause of the bug appears to be related to how the function tracks and handles indentation levels and newline characters. In the provided function, the logic for handling indentation levels and waiting for newline characters is not properly distinguishing between cases where comments are involved. This results in incorrect behavior when processing prefix strings with indents and comments.

To fix the bug, the conditional logic inside the `for` loop needs to be adjusted to correctly handle indentation levels and newlines. Specifically, the function should not reset the `wait_for_nl` flag when encountering a non-space character, as that indicates the end of the indentation.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                elif char == '\n':
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the conditional logic as described, the function should now handle the indentation correctly when encountering comments after dedenting, resolving the issue and passing the failing test.
