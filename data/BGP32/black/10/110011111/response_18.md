### Bug Analysis:
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is intended to consume a prefix string until a certain column is reached, preserving the existing indentation.
2. The bug causes incorrect handling of tabs and spaces in the prefix string, leading to erroneous indentation.
3. The function fails to correctly maintain the current column position and handle tab characters during the prefix consumption.
4. This bug causes incorrect indentation of comments after a dedent operation, as described in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic to handle tab characters correctly by adjusting the column position accordingly.
2. Ensure that the function correctly tracks the indentation level and handles mixed tab and space indentation.
3. Adjust the condition for detecting the beginning of a new line to prevent incorrect handling of comments after dedent operations.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version of the function should now accurately handle tab characters and maintain the correct column position during prefix consumption. This should address the bug that causes incorrect comment indentation after dedent operations.
