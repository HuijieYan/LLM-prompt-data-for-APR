### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix input string until a certain column limit is reached. The problem arises when encountering comments while consuming the prefix. The function fails to handle comments correctly, leading to incorrect indentation and results. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` highlights one such scenario.

#### Bug location:
The bug seems to be related to how the function handles comments within the prefix string. The logic to handle the indentation and comments needs to be reviewed and fixed.

#### Error cause:
The function fails to correctly handle the special case when encountering comments and mistakenly consumes newlines as part of the prefix.

#### Strategy to fix the bug:
1. Implement a proper logic to skip comments while counting the column position.
2. Update the indentation calculation logic to accurately track the column position.
3. Ensure that comments are correctly treated without affecting the column count.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                continue
            
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
                current_line += char
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
                current_line += char
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
            elif char == '#':
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                current_line += char

            if current_column >= column:
                break
                
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version includes:
1. Skipping comments correctly without adding them to the current line.
2. Resetting the column count when encountering a newline.
3. Updating the logic to handle comments appropriately without breaking the indentation tracking.

The corrected version should now pass the failing test `test_comment_indentation` and satisfy all the expected input/output variable values.
