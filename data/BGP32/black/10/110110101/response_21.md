### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming a prefix string based on the `column` parameter.
2. The function iterates over the characters in the prefix string, tracking the current line, column, and whether to wait for a new line.
3. The bug likely occurs in the logic where the function waits for a new line to determine the indentation level. This logic could lead to incorrect output, as seen in the failing test.
4. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` compares the formatted strings for a given input. The error message indicates a mismatch in the indentation of a commented line.
5. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic handling new lines and indentation tracking within the function.

### Bug:
The bug occurs when the function encounters a comment line after reaching the designated column limit. If there are spaces before the comment, the function incorrectly consumes them as part of the comment rather than maintaining the correct indentation.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for correctly handling the indentation of lines containing comments. Specifically, ensuring the correct indentation level is maintained when encountering comment lines.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_column < column:
                        lines.append(current_line)
                        current_line = ""
                        current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making these adjustments to the logic, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output values for all the given scenarios.
