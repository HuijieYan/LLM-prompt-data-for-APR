### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to process a prefix string by partially consuming it based on the given column.
2. The function maintains `lines`, `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl` variables to keep track of the current state.
3. The bug occurs when the function encounters a newline character (`\n`) and does not handle the cases of not updating the `current_line` correctly, leading to issues in maintaining the correct column position.
4. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` expects the function to correctly consume the prefix string based on the column value.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic where the function handles newline characters to ensure the correct behavior in terms of column position and line separation.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because when encountering a newline character (`\n`), the function does not properly reset the `current_column` value to 0 and advances the `lines` list. As a result, the expected behavior regarding the column position and line separation is not achieved.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling newline characters to reset the `current_column` value to 0 and appropriately manage the `lines` list based on the column value. This adjustment should ensure the correct consumption of the prefix string.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By incorporating the handling of newline characters as described above, the corrected version of the function should now correctly consume the prefix string in alignment with the expected behavior outlined in the test cases.
