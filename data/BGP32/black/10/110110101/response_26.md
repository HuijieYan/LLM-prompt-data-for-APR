### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix string based on a specified column number. The bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of indentation characters such as spaces and tabs. This bug causes the function to fail in scenarios where comments are indented differently.

### Bug Explanation:
The failing test shows a scenario where the comments are indented differently using tabs and spaces. The buggy function does not handle this scenario correctly, leading to the assertion error. The function fails to account for mixed indentation styles, resulting in an incorrect output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly accounts for both spaces and tabs when calculating the column position. By properly handling mixed indentation styles, the function should be able to correctly consume the prefix up to the specified column number.

### Corrected Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should be able to handle mixed indentation styles correctly and pass the failing test case.
