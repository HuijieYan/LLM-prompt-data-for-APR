### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a portion of the prefix string based on the given column.
2. The function initializes variables to track the current line, column, and whether to wait for a new line to be encountered before finishing the indentation.
3. The bug occurs when encountering a newline character, as it resets the current column to 0 but fails to update the `current_line` and `lines` variables correctly.
4. The bug causes incorrect handling of the prefix, resulting in mismatched indentation levels when compared to the expected output.
5. To fix the bug, the function should correctly update `current_line` and `lines` when encountering a newline character to accurately reflect the consumed prefix.

### Correction:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0

        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                current_line += char
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the handling of newline characters to correctly update `current_line` and `lines`, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases.
