The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string up to a certain column value in a way that respects indentation levels. However, it has a bug that causes it to not consider the correct line endings while parsing the prefix. This results in incorrect output when consuming prefixes with comment lines.

The issue lies in the handling of `\n` characters and maintaining the correct column value relative to the indentation levels. When a newline character is encountered, the function fails to reset the `current_column` back to 0, leading to incorrect calculations and skipping of certain characters.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that whenever a newline character is found, we reset the `current_column` to 0. Additionally, the function should correctly handle cases where the current line is empty (when encountering multiple consecutive newlines).

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset column if a newline is encountered
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = current_column >= column

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should now properly handle indentation and newline character evaluations while consuming the prefix string, ensuring that the output matches the expected values and passes the failing test cases.
