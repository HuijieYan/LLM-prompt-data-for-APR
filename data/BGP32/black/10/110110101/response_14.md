### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix until a certain column value is reached. It keeps track of the lines in the prefix and the current column position.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles tab characters ('\t') in terms of column counting.
3. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` focuses on comparing the indentation of the comments in the input contents and the expected output after running the function.
4. The bug likely arises when dealing with the column count for tab characters. The current implementation does not handle tabs properly, causing discrepancies in the final output.
5. The strategy to fix the bug is to properly handle tab characters ('\t') for column counting. Tabs typically correspond to 4 spaces, so they should be treated as such in terms of column increments.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Increment column by 4 for tab characters
        elif char == '\n':
            # Unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # Indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

With this fix, the function should now properly handle tab characters and update the column count accordingly. This should address the bug and align the function's behavior with the expected values in the failing test cases.
