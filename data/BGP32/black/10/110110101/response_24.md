### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a part of a given prefix string until a certain column limit is reached.
2. The function iterates over each character in the prefix string, updating the `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl` flags accordingly.
3. The issue lies in the condition where the function checks if the character is a newline (`char == '\n'`). This condition does not handle the case where the newline character is followed by spaces or tabs. This leads to incorrect output in the failing test case.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of the '\n' character, resulting in unexpected behavior in the function.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic when encountering a newline character. We should reset `current_column` and continue consuming until encountering a non-whitespace character.

### Corrected Function:
```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    while current_column < column:
                        if prefix and prefix[0] == ' ' or prefix[0] == '\t':
                            current_column += 1 if prefix[0] == ' ' else 4
                            prefix = prefix[1:]
                        else:
                            break
                    if current_column >= column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

Now, the corrected function should handle cases where the newline character is followed by spaces or tabs correctly.
