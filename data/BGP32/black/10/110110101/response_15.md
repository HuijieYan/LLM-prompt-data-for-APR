### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume the prefix up to a certain column. It iterates through each character in the prefix, keeps track of the current line, column, and whether to wait for a new line. However, the current implementation has a flaw in handling spaces and tabs, which leads to incorrect results.

### Identified issue
The issue lies in the handling of indentation with spaces and tabs. The function incorrectly increments `current_column` by 1 for spaces and 4 for tabs, leading to incorrect column tracking.

### Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is incorrect handling of indentation using spaces and tabs. The function does not properly handle the correct column count based on the indentation type used in the prefix.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for incrementing the `current_column` based on the type of character in the prefix. Tabs should increment the column by 4, and spaces should increment by 1. Additionally, we need to ensure that the correct line and column information is maintained when processing each character.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the corrected logic for incrementing `current_column` based on spaces and tabs, the function should now correctly track the column position in the prefix and return the expected results.
