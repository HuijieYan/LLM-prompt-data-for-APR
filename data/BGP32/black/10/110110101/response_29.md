### Explanation:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has an issue in handling the waiting for a new line condition. When encountering a newline character (`\n`), it should handle cases where the current line is not empty properly. This causes the output to be incorrect when dealing with indentation.
2. The failing test's error message points out a specific case where the function fails to handle indentation of comments correctly. It shows a mismatch between the expected output and the actual output due to incorrect handling of indentation.
3. The function fails to properly handle the indentation after a comment when encountering a newline character. It causes the indentation of the comment to be incorrect.
4. To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the case where the function is waiting for a new line after encountering a comment. It should reset the current column count to the specified column value when starting a new line after a comment.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl and char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
                current_line += char
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
                current_line += char
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                current_line += char
                wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By changing the condition where the function waits for a new line and making sure to properly handle the indentation when starting a new line after a comment, this corrected version should now pass the failing test cases.
