### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix by moving through it character by character until a certain column limit is reached. The function incorrectly handles indentation levels with tabs and spaces, resulting in incorrect consumption of the prefix.

The failing test `test_comment_indentation` aims to test comment indentation handling in the text formatter. It sets different contents with varying levels of indentation and comments and expects the formatted output to be correct.

The provided error message indicates that the formatted output does not match the expected output due to incorrect handling of comment indentation.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of indentation levels when processing the prefix in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. Specifically, the function does not correctly increment the `current_column` variable when encountering tabs (`\t`) or spaces (` `). This leads to an incorrect calculation of the column position while consuming the prefix, resulting in incorrect output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `current_column` variable accurately reflects the indentation level by incrementing it correctly when encountering tabs or spaces. Additionally, we must correctly handle scenarios where a newline character is encountered within the prefix to maintain the intended column positions.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                if not current_line.strip():  # skip empty lines
                    current_line = ""
                else:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This correction includes properly updating the `current_column` variable for tabs and spaces and accounting for newlines within the prefix. It ensures that the prefix is consumed correctly up to the specified column limit.
