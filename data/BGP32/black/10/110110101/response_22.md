### Analysis
The buggy function is `_partially_consume_prefix` in the `Driver` class. The function is designed to consume a prefix string up to a certain column number while keeping track of the line structure. The bug in this function seems to be related to handling tab characters and newline characters in terms of updating the `current_column` correctly.

The failing test, `test_comment_indentation`, is testing the behavior of the function when dealing with different types of indentation and comments within the prefix string. The error message indicates that the function is not handling the comment indentation correctly. The expected output for the failing test is presented in detail.

### Bug Explanation
1. In case 1, the function fails to correctly identify the end of the line after consuming the prefix, resulting in an incorrect current_line. This is due to not handling the case where the comment line contains only spaces.
2. In case 3, the same issue as in case 1 occurs when the function encounters tabs within the prefix, leading to incorrect column calculations and current_line.
3. In case 5, the function does not correctly handle tab characters when calculating the current_column, leading to inaccurate results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should revise the logic related to tab characters and update the current_line and current_column correctly based on the encountered characters. Additionally, we need to ensure the function correctly processes newline characters and spaces within the prefix.

### Corrected Version

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Assuming each tab is equal to 4 spaces
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should now correctly handle tab characters, spaces, and newline characters within the prefix, ensuring the proper extraction of the prefix up to the specified column number.
