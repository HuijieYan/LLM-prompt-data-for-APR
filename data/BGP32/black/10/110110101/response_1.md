### Explanation:

The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to the handling of indentation levels when consuming the prefix string. The current implementation calculates the column position incorrectly when encountering newline characters and spaces. This leads to incorrect behavior when removing indentation or consuming the prefix.

1. The current implementation does not correctly update the `current_column` variable based on the encountered characters such as '\n', spaces, and tabs.

2. The logic for resetting `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` when encountering a newline character is incorrect.

3. The condition to determine when to stop consuming characters and return the remaining prefix is not correctly checking if the current column exceeds the target column.

### Fix Strategy:

To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to adjust the logic for updating the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables while iterating over the prefix string. Additionally, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies when to stop consuming characters based on the target column position.

### Corrected Version:

```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False

        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                elif char == '\n':
                    if current_column < column:  # Check the column before resetting
                        current_column = 0
                    else:
                        lines.append(current_line)
                        current_line = ""
                        current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True

            current_line += char

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making these adjustments, the corrected function should now correctly consume the prefix string based on the target column position.
