### Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is in handling the indentation levels and comments within the provided `prefix` string. The function is incorrectly checking for a newline character to determine the end of the current line, which leads to incorrect handling of comments.

### Bug:
The bug occurs when a comment is encountered right after the indentation level. The function incorrectly interprets the comment line as the end of the current line, resulting in a mismatch between the expected and actual output strings.

### Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to revise the logic in the function to correctly handle comments while preserving the indentation levels. We should not treat comments as the end of a line unless there is an actual newline character present.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

This corrected version of the function should now correctly handle comments and calculate the indentation levels, ensuring that the expected output matches the actual output for the failing test cases.
