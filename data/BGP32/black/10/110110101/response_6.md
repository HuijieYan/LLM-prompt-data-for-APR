### Analysis
- The `partially_consume_prefix` function is supposed to partially consume the prefix up to a specific column, handling spaces, tabs, newlines, and indentation properly.
- The buggy function does not correctly handle the scenario where a line contains only spaces or tabs and finishes with a newline character.
- The failing test case is expecting the function to correctly handle comment indentation, but it fails due to incorrect handling of newline characters and indentation counting.

### Bug Cause
- The bug occurs because when a newline character is encountered while processing a line with only spaces or tabs, the function does not reset the `current_column` to 0. This leads to incorrect counting of columns and incorrect splitting of the prefix.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
- Modify the logic for handling newline characters to properly reset the `current_column`.
- Ensure that the function resets the `current_column` when encountering a newline character in a line with only spaces or tabs.

### Corrected Function
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip():  # Check if the line is not empty
                    if current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]                       
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    current_row = ""  # Ignore empty lines
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making these modifications, the function should now correctly handle newlines in lines with only spaces or tabs, ensuring proper indentation handling, and passing the failing test case.
