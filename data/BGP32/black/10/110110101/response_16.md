### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for consuming a prefix string until a certain column position is reached.
- The function uses the `wait_for_nl` flag to handle cases where a newline character is encountered in the prefix.
- The function is not correctly handling the cases where the column position is reached before encountering a newline character.
- This is leading to incorrect behavior and causing the failing test `test_comment_indentation` to fail.
- The failing test specifically provides examples where the function does not correctly consume the prefix string until the specified column position.

### Bug:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is that it doesn't handle cases where the column limit is reached before encountering a newline character. This leads to incorrect prefix consumption and causes the failing test to produce incorrect output.

### Fix Strategy:
- Modify the function logic to ensure that the prefix string is correctly consumed until the specified column position is reached.
- Make sure to correctly handle cases where the column position is reached before encountering a newline character.

### Corrected Version:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if current_column >= column:
                break
                
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the above corrections to the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, the function should now correctly consume the prefix string until the specified column position is reached, resolving the bug and making the failing test pass.
