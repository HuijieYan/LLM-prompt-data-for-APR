### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the incorrect handling of the indentation when encountering a newline character. The function fails to properly adjust the current column count when encountering a newline, leading to incorrect line concatenation and indentation assumptions.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to correctly update the `current_column` count when encountering a newline character. This adjustment should consider the potential preceding whitespace characters (spaces and tabs) that belong to the current line. Additionally, the concatenation of lines and resetting of variables should occur at the appropriate points to ensure correct separation between lines.

### Corrected Version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                continue

        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        
        current_line += char
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the `current_column` count appropriately when encountering a newline character and adjusting the line concatenation logic, the corrected function should now handle the indentation and line separation correctly. This fixed version should pass the failing test cases provided.
