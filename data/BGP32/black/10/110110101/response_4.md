### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a part of the input `prefix` string based on the input `column` value. It appears to be designed to selectively extract lines from the `prefix` until the specified `column` is reached. However, the current implementation has a bug where it fails to correctly handle indentation levels and empty lines. This bug is reflected in the failing test `test_comment_indentation`. 

The test case provides different contents for `contents_tab` and `contents_spc` with varying indentation levels and comments. The function `fs` in the test case is expected to normalize the indentation to spaces and then compare it with the expected contents. The failing assertion in the test case indicates that the buggy function is not properly handling the indentation and comment lines.

### Bug Explanation
The specific bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to how it handles different indentation levels and different scenarios with spaces, tabs, new lines, and comments. The function doesn't correctly track the current column and skips some characters when waiting for a new line after indentation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly tracks the current column based on different characters in the `prefix`. It should handle indentation levels properly and correctly include lines with comments. Specifically, the handling of indentation using spaces and tabs should be adjusted to keep track of the correct column position.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the logic in the function to correctly track the current column and handle different characters for indentation, this corrected version should now properly consume the prefix string based on the specified column value. This should address the bug and allow the failing test `test_comment_indentation` to pass successfully.
