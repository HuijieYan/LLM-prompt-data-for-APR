### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a part of the given prefix string until it reaches a specific column. However, the function contains a bug where it fails to account for newlines within the prefix string, leading to incorrect results.

### Identified Bug
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of newlines within the prefix string. When encountering a newline character, the function should reset the current column count to 0 and continue processing the remaining characters. However, in the current implementation, when it encounters a newline character, it resets the current column count but does not reset the `current_line`, resulting in incorrect slicing of the prefix string.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when a newline character is encountered in the prefix string, the `current_line` is properly reset along with the `current_column` count.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    current_line = char  # Reset current_line upon encountering newline
                    current_column = 0
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                current_line = ""  # Reset current_line upon encountering newline
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures that the `current_line` is properly reset when encountering newline characters within the prefix string. This should resolve the bug and make the function correctly handle newlines.
