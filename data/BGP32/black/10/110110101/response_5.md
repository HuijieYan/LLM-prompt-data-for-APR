### Analysis
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming a prefix based on a given column value.
- The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is trying to compare two strings with different indentations but similar content, causing an assertion error.
- The function has multiple conditional statements to handle different characters in the prefix.
- The expected values of variables during the failing test must be adjusted to meet the correct indentation for comparison.

### Cause of the Bug
- The bug occurs because the function does not correctly handle the indentation based on spaces and tabs in the input prefix.
- The function fails to maintain the correct indentation in `current_line`, leading to discrepancies in the output compared to the expected values.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
- Adjust the logic in the function to correctly maintain the indentation.
- Update the conditionals to handle tabs and spaces appropriately.
- Ensure that `current_line` maintains the correct indentation level.
- Update the return statements to provide the correct partial consumption of the prefix.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            current_line += char
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the aforementioned adjustments, the corrected function should now handle the prefix appropriately and pass the failing test cases.
