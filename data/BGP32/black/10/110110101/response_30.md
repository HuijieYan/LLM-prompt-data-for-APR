### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is meant to consume a prefix string until a certain column limit is reached, then return the consumed prefix and the remaining text. The issue seems to be with the logic related to waiting for a new line to determine whether the column limit has been reached.

### Potential Error Location
1. The logic inside the loop that checks for `wait_for_nl` and resets `current_column` and `current_line`.
2. Conditional statements for different characters like space, tab, and newline.

### Bug Cause
The bug is causing incorrect behavior based on how the function processes the prefix text, leading to incorrect calculations of the `current_column` and the consumed lines.

For example, in the failing test case, when the function is provided with `'\t# comment\n\t'` and `2` as inputs, it doesn't handle the indentation properly, leading to an incorrect current_column value and consumed lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Adjust the logic inside the loop to correctly handle the newline condition.
2. Modify the indentation calculation based on space and tab characters.
3. Ensure correct updating of `current_line` and `current_column`.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if len(current_line) - current_line.count('\t') == column:
                        lines.append(current_line)
                        current_line = ""
                        current_column = 0
                        wait_for_nl = False
                    else:
                        return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0 if len(current_line) == 0 else current_column
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After making the above changes, the function should correctly consume the prefix text up to the specified column and return the consumed lines and the remaining text.
