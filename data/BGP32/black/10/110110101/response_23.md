### Explanation of the bug in the buggy function:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the incorrect handling of the indentation levels when encountering a comment without following it by a newline character. This leads to incorrect indentation offset calculations, resulting in a mismatch between the expected and actual output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle comment lines within the given prefix while ensuring that the indentation levels are accurately accounted for.

### Corrected Version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip():  # Check if the line is not empty before adding it to lines
                lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By incorporating the correction mentioned above, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now correctly handle the indentation levels and comment lines within the prefix, ensuring that the expected output matches the actual output for the given test cases.
