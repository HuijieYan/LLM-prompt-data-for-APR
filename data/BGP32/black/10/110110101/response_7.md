### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix until a certain column number is reached. It appends characters to `current_line` until a newline character is encountered. 
2. There is a logical error in the condition for appending `current_line` to `lines`. The condition should be based on the comparison of `current_column` with the desired `column` value.
3. The failing test case 'test_comment_indentation' is comparing formatted strings with different indentation levels due to the bug in `_partially_consume_prefix`.
4. To fix the bug, the condition for appending `current_line` to `lines` needs to be modified to ensure it captures the correct indentation until the desired column is reached.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
class Driver:
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False

        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                if current_column >= column:
                    wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the condition to handle the indentation level correctly, the function should now produce the expected output for the failing test cases and satisfy the defined input/output values.
