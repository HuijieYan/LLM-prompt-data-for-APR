### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume part of a given prefix string based on a specified column value. The function iterates through each character in the prefix string and builds lines until a certain column position is reached. However, the function fails to handle tab characters correctly when calculating the current column position. This leads to incorrect indentation handling and results in failing the test.

### Error:
The error occurs due to incorrect processing of tab characters in the `current_column` calculation, causing an incorrect determination of the current column position.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how tab characters are counted for the column position. Tabs should be expanded to the appropriate number of spaces to accurately calculate the current column position.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            spaces_to_add = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_column += spaces_to_add
            current_line += " " * spaces_to_add
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
        
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After making these changes, the function should now correctly handle tab characters and calculate the current column position accurately. This corrected version should pass the failing test case provided.
