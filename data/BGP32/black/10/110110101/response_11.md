### Analysis
1. The `Driver` class contains a buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` that is used to consume a prefix string partially based on a given `column` value.
2. The function tracks the current line, current column, and whether to wait for a new line character.
3. The bug seems to be related to the handling of indentation with spaces and tabs in the input prefix string.
4. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` aims to compare the indentation of comments with spaces and tabs.
5. The bug is causing the function to incorrectly return the consumed content leading to an assertion error.

### Bug Explanation
- In the failing test case mentioned, the function fails to correctly consume the prefix when encountering a comment line with different indentation styles (tabs vs. spaces).
- The bug causes the function to return different results when consuming the prefix based on the indentation type.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Review the logic in the function related to handling spaces, tabs, and new lines.
- Adjust the logic to correctly consume the prefix while considering different indentation styles.
- Ensure that the consumed content aligns with the given column value.

### Corrected Function
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the logic in the function to handle different types of indentation properly, the corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
