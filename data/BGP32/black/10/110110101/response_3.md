### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a portion of the input prefix based on the given column number. It iterates over the characters in the prefix, accumulating them into `current_line` until it reaches the specified column or encounters a new line character. At that point, it appends the accumulated lines to the `lines` list and resets the `current_line`. However, there seems to be an issue with handling the new line characters and indentations correctly, leading to incorrect output and a failing test case.

### Identified Issue
The primary issue seems to be caused by not handling newline characters and indentations correctly. The logic for incrementing `current_column` when encountering spaces or tabs is flawed, leading to discrepancies in the consumed prefix. This causes the test case for comment indentation to fail.

### Fix Strategy
To address the issue, we need to update how the function handles spaces, tabs, and new line characters to accurately determine the column position and accumulate lines properly. Additionally, we need to ensure that comments are correctly preserved in the consumed prefix.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
                current_line += ' ' * 3  # Adjusting the additional space count for tabs
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version includes modifications to handle tabs correctly by adjusting the count for spaces accordingly. Additionally, proper handling of new line characters is implemented to ensure the consumed prefix is generated accurately. This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
