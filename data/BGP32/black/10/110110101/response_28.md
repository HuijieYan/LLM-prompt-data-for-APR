### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column value and return the consumed part. However, the function fails to handle indentation properly, leading to the incorrect splitting of the prefix. The issue lies in the logic related to indentation handling and waiting for a new line.

### Bug Explanation
In the failing test case `test_comment_indentation`, the buggy function fails to correctly handle the indentation for lines containing comments. When there is an unexpected empty line (indentation issue), the function does not reset the `current_column` to `0` and does not set `wait_for_nl` to `True` to wait for the next non-empty line. This leads to incorrect splitting and mismatch in the expected and actual values.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation levels and waits for a new non-empty line when encountering an unexpected empty line. This involves resetting the `current_column` to `0` and setting `wait_for_nl` to `True` in such situations.

### Corrected Function
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip():  # Check for unexpected empty line
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line

```

By making the adjustments highlighted in the corrected function, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now be able to handle indentation correctly and pass the failing test cases.
