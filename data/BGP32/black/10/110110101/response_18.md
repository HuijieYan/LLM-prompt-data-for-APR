### Analysis
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is encountering issues with handling indentation levels and newlines within the `prefix` string.
- The function incorrectly identifies the end of an indentation level by looking for a newline character after a space or tab character.
- In the failing test, the function fails to correctly format the prefix string, resulting in a mismatch when compared with the expected formatted version.
- This issue leads to incorrect alignment of comments within the code.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises because the function does not correctly handle situations where comments are placed in the middle of an indentation level and followed by a newline. The function incorrectly assumes that the comment marks the end of the indentation level, leading to unexpected formatting issues.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies the end of an indentation level based on the actual number of spaces or tabs, rather than on the presence of a newline character after a space or tab.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic for identifying the end of an indentation level, the corrected function should now handle comments within the indentation levels appropriately and pass the failing test.
