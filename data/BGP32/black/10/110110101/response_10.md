### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string up to a given column value, maintaining line breaks and whitespace preservation accordingly.
2. The function initializes several variables to keep track of the state while iterating over the prefix string.
3. The bug likely occurs when handling the detection of the need for a newline character based on the column value.
4. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` aims to compare formatted strings with different indentation styles but equivalent content, causing an assertion error due to inconsistent handling of newline characters.
5. The expected input/output values for the function cases are provided.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when the function incorrectly sets `wait_for_nl` to `True` before encountering a newline character, causing the line content to mix up during prefix consumption.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for detecting the necessity of a newline character based on the specified column value, ensuring proper handling of newline characters and preserving the original line content.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the logic in the `elif char == '\n'` block, we ensure that newline characters are correctly handled based on the column value, preventing the mixing of line content during prefix consumption.
