The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` appears to have an issue with handling the indentation level for comments correctly. The function is supposed to partially consume a given prefix based on a specified column value and return the consumed part and the remaining part. However, in the case of comments, the function fails to maintain the correct indentation level after a dedent operation.

The root cause of this bug is the incorrect handling of the wait_for_nl variable. When encountering a comment line, the function incorrectly sets wait_for_nl to True, which leads to the indentation for the comment being adjusted based on the following newline character. This behavior results in incorrect indentation alignment for comments, especially after a dedent operation.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the wait_for_nl variable is set to True only after a non-comment character is encountered, indicating the end of the previous line's indentation. This change should prevent the incorrect adjustment of comment indentation.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False

        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char

            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                if current_line.lstrip().startswith('#'):
                    if wait_for_nl:
                        if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                            res = ''.join(lines)
                            return res, prefix[len(res):]
                else:
                    lines.append(current_line)

                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the adjustment described above, the function should now correctly handle the indentation of comments after dedents. This correction aligns with the expected behavior and should address the issue reported on GitHub regarding incorrect comment indentation.
