### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for handling indentation levels within a code snippet. The error occurs when a comment is encountered after an indent but before a dedent. The function incorrectly handles the indentation level of the comment in this scenario.

The failing test `test_comment_indentation` provides two code snippets, one with tabs and the other with spaces. The test fails because the function `_partially_consume_prefix` does not correctly handle comment indentation after a dedent in the case of tabs.

The expected input/output values for the failing test are provided for various scenarios to guide the correction of the bug. The GitHub issue highlights this bug affecting code with tabs and comments.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs when encountering a comment after an indent and before a dedent with tab characters. The function doesn't properly handle the adjustment of the comment's indentation level. This leads to incorrect formatting of the comment's indentation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, specifically handling the case when a comment appears between an indent and a dedent with tab characters:
1. Identify the situation when a comment is encountered after an indent and update the comment's indentation level accurately.
2. Ensure that the comment's indentation matches the next line's indentation level.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        count_tab = 0
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    count_tab = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
                count_tab += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                if count_tab > 0:
                    current_column -= count_tab
                count_tab = 0
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

        if count_tab > 0:
            current_column -= count_tab
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected function introduces a new variable `count_tab` to keep track of the number of tab characters encountered. Upon encountering a newline character after a tab character, the function adjusts the `current_column` based on the `count_tab` before moving to the next line.

This correction should resolve the bug and ensure that comments after an indent and before a dedent with tab characters are correctly formatted.
