### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is supposed to partially consume a prefix text based on a given column value.
- The function keeps track of the lines, current line, current column position, and a flag to wait for a new line.
- The issue arises when dealing with indentation changes after a dedent.
- The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is checking the behavior of the function with different indentation scenarios and comments.

### Error Locations:
1. The handling of the `wait_for_nl` condition seems to be the main cause of the bug.
2. The logic to determine when to start waiting for a new line does not account for comment indentation correctly.

### Bug Explanation:
- In the failing test, the comment indentation is not correctly handled after dedent operations.
- The incorrect condition for `wait_for_nl` leads to incorrect handling of new lines and indentation after detenting.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Adjust the logic related to `wait_for_nl` to correctly handle comment indentation after dedent operations.
- Ensure that the function properly tracks the changes in indentation levels.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            if wait_for_nl:
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char != '\n':
                wait_for_nl = True
                
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should now handle the comment indentation correctly after dedent operations.
