### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string until a specified column is reached by counting spaces, tabs, and new lines.
2. The issue lies in how the function handles the logic for determining the indentation level of comments after a dedent.
3. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` focuses on comparing the alignment of comments after dedent in the input strings with spaces and tabs. The error message shows a misalignment in a case with tabs in the input.
4. The bug causes incorrect handling of comments indentation after a dedent operation when tabs are involved.
5. To resolve the bug, we need to modify how the function processes the tabs and new lines when waiting for the next line's indentation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic inside the `if` condition checking for `'\t'` to correctly calculate the column position after encountering a tab.
2. Adjust the logic related to waiting for the next line to handle tabs and new lines appropriately in context.
3. Ensure that the function correctly processes tabs and considers them as advance in column position.
4. Maintain the integrity of comments alignment after dedent operations with tabs involved.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 8 - (current_column % 8)  # Increase column due to tab
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By incorporating the changes as shown in the corrected version above, the bug related to incorrect comment indentation after a dedent with tabs will be resolved, and the failing test case `test_comment_indentation` should pass successfully.
