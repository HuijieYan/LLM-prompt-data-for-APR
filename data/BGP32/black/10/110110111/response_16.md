The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has an issue where the function incorrectly handles indentation when encountering a comment after a dedent. The issue described in the GitHub problem indicates that when a comment is encountered after a dedent, the comment's indentation should align with the next line of code rather than the previous one.

The problem can be identified within the `if char == '\n':` block where the current_column is not updated correctly. The condition `elif char == ' ':` is incorrectly used to increment the `current_column` counter. Instead, the logic should ensure that after encountering a newline char, if there is a non-empty line, the comment's indentation aligns with the next line, not the previous one.

To address this bug and satisfy the failing test case, we need to adjust the logic for handling newlines with comments after a dedent and ensure that the comment indentation properly aligns with the next line of code. 

Here is a corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # Adjust the indentation for comments after dedent
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases related to correctly aligning comment indentation after a dedent.
