### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a given prefix of characters based on indentation.
2. The function iterates through the characters of the prefix, tracking the current line, column, and waiting for a newline character to finalize the current line.
3. The issue arises when handling tab characters ('\t') for indentation.
4. The failed test `test_comment_indentation` checks if the function correctly handles the given prefix and indentation for different scenarios.
5. The error message indicates a mismatch between the expected and actual output values of the function.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because when encountering a tab character, the function increments the current column by 4, but it should only increment by 1. This incorrect handling of tab characters leads to differences in indentation levels in the output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, adjust the handling of tab characters so that the current column is incremented by 1 instead of 4. This change ensures that the indentation is consistent with the number of tabs.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 1  # Corrected tab handling
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying this correction, the function should handle tab characters correctly and pass the failing test cases for different scenarios involving indentation.
