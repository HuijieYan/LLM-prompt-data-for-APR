### Analysis:
1. The function "_partially_consume_prefix" in the Driver class is designed to consume a prefix string based on indentation levels up to a certain column value.
2. The buggy function fails to correctly handle cases where comments are indented after dedentation.
3. The failing test "test_comment_indentation" showcases the issue when comparing the expected and actual formatted strings.
4. The expected input/output values for different cases provide specific scenarios to consider for fixing the function.
5. The GitHub issue details a similar problem related to inaccurate handling of tabulated comments after dedentation.

### Bug Cause:
1. The bug occurs when the function encounters a '\n' character, which resets the current column count but doesn't re-adjust the column based on the existing indentation.
2. As a result, when a comment is encountered after dedentation, the current column is not properly updated, leading to incorrect indentation.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the logic related to handling '\n' characters to accurately track the current column based on indentation levels.
2. Ensure that the current column is updated correctly after encountering a newline character to maintain the correct indentation level when processing comments.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Update current column based on existing indentation
            current_column = 0
            for ch in current_line:
                if ch == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif ch == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By incorporating the suggested fixes, the updated function should now correctly handle the indentation of comments after dedentation, addressing the bug reported in the failing test and the corresponding GitHub issue.
