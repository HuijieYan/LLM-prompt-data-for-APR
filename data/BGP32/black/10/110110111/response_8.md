### Analysis:
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is responsible for consuming a part of the prefix input based on certain conditions related to column and indentation.
2. The function initializes variables such as `lines`, `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl`.
3. The issue seems to be with handling the indentation for comments after a dedent when the input uses tabs instead of spaces.
4. The failing test case is related to comparing the indented comment in the original content with the incorrectly reformatted comment in the modified content.
5. The expected values for different test cases involve correct handling of indentation, line splitting, and other conditions based on the characters in the input prefix string.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of indentation when encountering comments after a dedent in the input content. The function does not properly track the column and handle the indentation in such scenarios, leading to incorrect output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the column and indentation, especially when dealing with comments after a dedent. Adjust the logic to properly track the column position and handle the indentation characters ('\t' and ' '), ensuring the comments are formatted correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the indentation tracking and column management logic in the function, the corrected version should now properly handle comments after a dedent and satisfy the expected input/output values for the failing test cases.
