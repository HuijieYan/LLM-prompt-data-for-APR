Based on the provided information, it seems that the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is incorrectly handling the case where comments are present after an indent and then a dedent. The function fails in several scenarios where the indentation of comments is not maintained correctly after dedents.

The root cause of the bug lies in how the function is processing the characters in the prefix string and handling the indentation logic. When reaching a comment, the function incorrectly updates the `current_column` without considering the subsequent lines' indentation level.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the cases where comments are present after an indent and a dedent, preserving the correct indentation levels.

Here is a corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            if char in [' ', '\t']:
                current_line += char
                current_column += 4 if char == '\t' else 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                lines.append(current_line + char)
                current_line = ""
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                current_line += char
        if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
            res = ''.join(lines)
            return res, prefix[len(res):]
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should address the issue with incorrect comment indentation after dedents. It should now correctly maintain the correct indentation levels for comments according to the input strings.
