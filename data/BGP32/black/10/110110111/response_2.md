Based on the provided information, the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is mainly related to the incorrect handling of tab characters in comments causing indentation to be altered incorrectly. The function fails to maintain the correct indentation while processing comments with tabs.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The calculation of `current_column` for tab characters is incorrect.
2. Handling of wait_for_nl condition for tab characters and comments.

### Cause of the Bug:
When the function encounters a tab character in the prefix, it incorrectly increments `current_column` by 4 instead of 1, causing the incorrect indentation. This bug leads to the failing test case where the comment indentation is not preserved as expected.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the calculation of `current_column` for tab characters to increment by 1 instead of 4.
2. Correctly handle the wait_for_nl condition for tab characters.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 1  # Fix: Correct the increment for tab character
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By applying the above corrections to the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, the provided failing test should now pass, preserving the expected comment indentation as required.
