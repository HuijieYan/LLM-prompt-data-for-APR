The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has a logical error that causes incorrect handling of indentation when processing prefixes. The issue arises when dealing with comments that should be aligned at the same level as the code but get incorrectly indented.

The main source of the issue is the condition `if char == '\n':` inside the loop. Once the function encounters a newline character, it resets the `current_column` to 0, but it should handle the case where the comment immediately follows the code on the same level.

To fix this issue, we need to adjust the logic to ensure that comments are aligned correctly with the code according to their level of indentation.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By modifying the condition for handling newline characters and adjusting the logic accordingly, the corrected version should now align comments correctly with the surrounding code while respecting the indentation levels. With this fix, the function should pass the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub regarding incorrect indentation handling for tabulated comments after a dedent.
