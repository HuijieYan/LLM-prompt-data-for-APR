### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for handling indentation in a given input prefix string. It tracks the columns and lines based on the indentation rules in the input. The reported issue is related to incorrect handling of comments indentation after a dedent, especially when tabs are used.

### Identified Potential Errors
1. The condition for waiting for a newline (`wait_for_nl`) may lead to incorrect behavior when encountering different characters.
2. Incorrect update of `current_line` and `current_column` variables.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs when the function encounters a comment line after a dedent operation, especially when tabs are used for indentation. The function does not handle this scenario correctly, leading to a difference in the expected and actual indentation levels of comments.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Adjust the logic related to waiting for a newline character to accommodate correct behavior.
2. Ensure that the `current_line` and `current_column` variables are updated appropriately.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        for char in prefix:
            if char == ' ':
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_line += char
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
        lines.append(current_line)
        return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
```

By adjusting the behavior of the function to correctly handle comments after dedents, the corrected version above should resolve the issue reported on GitHub. This fix aims to maintain consistent indentation levels for comments, especially after dedent operations, regardless of using tabs or spaces for indentation.
