The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has logic related to consuming the prefix of a line based on indentation levels. However, it fails to correctly handle the cases where comments are present after dedents. This leads to incorrect behavior for tabulated comments.

### Issues with the buggy function:
1. The conditional check for `wait_for_nl` is not properly handling the case when a non-empty line with insufficient columns is encountered.
2. The logic to handle characters like tabs and spaces to calculate the current column is incorrect.

### Bug cause:
The bug occurs because the function fails to keep track of the correct column positions when encountering tabulated comments after a dedent. This leads to incorrect indentation levels for comments.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Improve the logic for handling column calculations to correctly account for tabs.
2. Modify the condition checks to ensure correct handling of non-empty lines with insufficient columns.

### Corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)  # Adjust for tabs
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the function as shown above, it should now correctly handle tabulated comments after dedents and solve the indentation issue reported in the GitHub issue.
