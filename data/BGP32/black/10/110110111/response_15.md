### Bug Explanation:
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is responsible for handling indentation in the code, specifically for comments. The bug arises when there is a dedent operation followed by a comment with a specific indent. The function incorrectly processes the newline character in such cases, leading to an incorrect output.

The failing test `test_comment_indentation` provides specific scenarios where comments with specific indentation are not handled correctly by the function.

Upon analyzing the failing test case and the expected values, we can see that the function fails to maintain the correct indentation levels for comments after a dedent operation. It either fails to maintain the existing indent level or introduces an incorrect indent. This discrepancy causes the `assertFormatEqual` assertion to fail during the test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address this bug, we need to modify the logic within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent operation. Specifically, we need to ensure that the comment indentation matches the expected indentation level based on the surrounding code.

We need to adjust the handling of newline characters and the indentation calculation while processing each character in the input prefix. By tracking the current indentation level and correctly identifying the start of a new line or a comment, we can ensure that comments are correctly aligned relative to the surrounding code.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By incorporating the logic to correctly handle comments after a dedent and ensuring that the indentation levels are maintained as expected, this corrected version of the function should address the bug and pass the failing test cases.
