### Analysis
The `Driver` class contains a buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` which is responsible for partially consuming a prefix based on indentation in the input code. The issue seems to be related to incorrect handling of indentation when encountering comments after a dedent.

### Error Locations
1. The incorrect handling of indentation logic when encountering a comment after a dedent.
2. The way the current line is appended to the `lines` list, which is insufficient to handle comments correctly.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises due to the `_partially_consume_prefix` function not correctly processing the indentation when a comment occurs after a dedent. This leads to incorrect handling of the comment indentation during code formatting.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the logic in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` needs to be adjusted to correctly handle comments following a dedent. Additionally, the logic for appending the current line to the `lines` list needs to account for comments as well.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                elif char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                elif char == '\n':
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                if char == '\n' or char == '#':
                    wait_for_nl = True
        res = ''.join(lines)
        return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

### Justifications for the Changes Made
1. Added a condition to set `wait_for_nl` to `True` when encountering a comment character in the input. This ensures correct handling of comments following a dedent.
2. Adjusted the logic to append the current line to the `lines` list when encountering a new line character or a comment character. This ensures comments are included in the processed prefix.

With these changes, the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now handle indentation correctly, especially when dealing with comments after dedents.
