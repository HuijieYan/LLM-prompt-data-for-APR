### Analysis:
1. **Class and Function Relationship:**
   - The class `Driver` contains the function `_partially_consume_prefix`.
   
2. **Test Code:**
   - The failing test `test_comment_indentation` in the `tests/test_black.py` file compares the output of the function `fs` with expected contents.
   
3. **Error Message:**
   - The test fails due to an assertion error where the expected indentation of a comment is incorrect.

4. **Expected Input/Output Values:**
   - The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is expected to handle indentation and newline characters correctly to partially consume the prefix based on the provided column value.
   - The function should return the remaining prefix after consuming based on column value.

5. **GitHub Issue:**
   - The issue is related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent. The sample input provided in the issue description matches the failing test scenario.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function leads to incorrect handling of indentation, specifically with tabs and comments. Incorrect logic for tracking the current column position during prefix consumption results in wrong indentation comparisons.

### Potential Bug Location:
- The issue seems to occur when handling tab characters, spaces, and newlines while determining the current column position within the prefix string.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Adjust the logic to correctly track the current column position using tabs and spaces.
- Ensure that the function considers the position correctly for indentation scenarios involving both tabs and spaces.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Adjust tab indentation
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the logic for tracking the current column position based on tabs and spaces, the corrected version of the function should now handle the indentation correctly and pass the failing test scenario.
