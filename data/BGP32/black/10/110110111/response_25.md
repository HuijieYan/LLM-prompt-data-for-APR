The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to correctly handling the indentation of comments after a dedent operation. The function does not properly consider the column offset when processing comments. This results in incorrect output when handling comments that are indented further than the previous line.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comment indentation is maintained correctly based on the column offset provided. Additionally, we should handle the case where the comment starts at the very beginning of the input prefix.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
# The fixed version of the buggy function
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # reset current_column for a new line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            if current_column < column:
                indent = ' ' * (column - current_column)
                current_line += indent
                current_column = column
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adding the correct handling for comment indentation based on the column offset, this corrected function should now pass the failing test and produce the expected output for all the test cases provided.

Ensure to run the tests after applying this corrected function to verify that the bug has been fixed successfully.
