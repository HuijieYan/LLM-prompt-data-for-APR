### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming a given prefix string based on a specified column position.
- The error occurs when the function incorrectly adjusts indentation for comments after a dedent in the input code when the code uses tabs.
- The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is specifically designed to identify and test this bug related to comment indentation.
- The error message shows a specific mismatch in indentation for comments between the expected string and the actual output string.
- The expected input/output values for different cases have been provided to guide the correction process.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug causes incorrect handling of comments after a dedent when tabs are used in the input code.
- The function does not correctly adjust the indentation of comments based on the specified column position.
- This leads to inconsistencies in the indentation of comments compared to the rest of the code.

### Fix Strategy:
- Update the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle indentation adjustments for comments, especially after a dedent when tabs are used.
- Ensure that comments are aligned properly based on the specified column position.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function as shown above, the bug related to incorrect comment indentation should be resolved, and the corrected version should pass the failing test cases with the expected input/output values.
