### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming the prefix string based on the given column parameter while handling indentation.
2. The failing test case `test_comment_indentation` involves checking the correct indentation of comments after dedent operations, specifically for tabs and spaces.
3. The error message indicates an assertion failure in comparing the actual formatted result to the expected result, particularly for comment indentation.
4. The expected input/output values are provided for various test cases to guide in fixing the bug.
5. The GitHub issue highlights the specific problem with indentation after dedents for tabulated comments in the provided sample input.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to incorrect handling of indentation calculation based on spaces and tabs when consuming the prefix string.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the calculation of indentation is accurate, especially when dealing with different types of whitespace characters (spaces and tabs).

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl and char != '\n':
                # Check if the current line is non-empty and the current column is less than the target
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Update to handle tab as 4 spaces
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                wait_for_nl = False
            current_line += char
        lines.append(current_line)  # Add the remaining line
        res = ''.join(lines).rstrip()  # Join lines and remove trailing whitespaces
        return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

By making adjustments to the handling of whitespace characters and line continuation logic, the corrected function should now properly consume the prefix string based on the specified column parameter.
