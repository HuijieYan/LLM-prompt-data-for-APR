The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to the incorrect handling of indentation, specifically tabs, while parsing the input `prefix`. This issue is causing incorrect changes in indentation for comments after a dedent operation.

The main cause of the bug is the improper calculation of the current column when encountering tabs (`\t`) in the input prefix. The function incorrectly increments `current_column` by 4 for each tab encountered, assuming that each tab represents 4 spaces in terms of indentation. This assumption is incorrect and leads to incorrect indentation alignment.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic for handling tabs. Tabs are typically considered equivalent to a certain number of spaces, which can vary depending on the context. In Python, tabs are considered equivalent to 8 spaces. So, we should update the logic to appropriately handle tabs by incrementing `current_column` by 8 for each tab encountered in the input prefix.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Update tab handling to increment by 8
            current_column += 8
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic to handle tabs properly by incrementing `current_column` by 8 for each tab, the function now correctly processes the input prefix and preserves the correct indentation alignment, as described in the GitHub issue.
