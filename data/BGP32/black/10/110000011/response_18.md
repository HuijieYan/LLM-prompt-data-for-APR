Based on the provided information, the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to handling different types of indentation characters, specifically tabs, spaces, and newline characters. This leads to incorrect behavior when dealing with comments after a dedent in the input code.

The cause of the bug:
- The function fails to properly handle tabulated comments after a dedent because it doesn't take into account the column differences between tabs and spaces when calculating the current column position.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the function to correctly handle tab characters and calculate the column position accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        else:
            current_column += 1
        current_line += char
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug. It correctly handles tab characters for indentation and adjusts the column position accordingly.
