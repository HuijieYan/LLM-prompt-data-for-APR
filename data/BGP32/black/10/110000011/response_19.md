### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` in the `Driver` class is responsible for handling the indentation logic when processing a prefix string.
- The issue reported on GitHub suggests that the indentation for comments after a dedent is changed incorrectly when tabs are used in the input file.

### Error Locations:
1. The logic for handling tabs (\t) in the input is adding 4 to the `current_column`, which is incorrect as tabs usually represent one level of indentation.
2. The condition to check for the end of an indent is not correctly considering the case where a character is neither a space nor a tab.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of tab characters in the input string. Adding 4 to the `current_column` for each tab character is distorting the actual indentation level, leading to incorrect formatting of comments after a dedent.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic to correctly handle tab characters by incrementing `current_column` by 1 when encountering a tab (\t).
2. Adjust the condition to check for the end of an indent to ensure it covers all cases where the character is not a space, tab, or newline.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 1  # Increment only by 1 for tab
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version adjusts the handling of tab characters by incrementing `current_column` by 1 for each tab encountered. The conditions are also modified to appropriately handle the end of an indent. This modification should help in resolving the issue reported on GitHub related to incorrect indentation handling for comments after a dedent when tabs are used in the input file.
