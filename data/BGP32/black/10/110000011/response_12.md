### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is used to handle indentation and tabulation within a given prefix. The issue reported on GitHub related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent seems to be pointing towards a problem in this function where tabs are not handled properly.

### Potential Error Location:
The issue might lie in how the function calculates the column position `current_column` when encountering tabs.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from incorrect handling of tabs in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. Tabs are counted as a single character, but their visual representation as whitespace is usually more than one space. This inconsistency causes the misalignment in the indentation when tabs are present in the input.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that tabs are correctly handled in calculating the column position. When encountering a tab character, the function should increment the `current_column` by the equivalent number of spaces to maintain proper alignment.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            num_spaces = 4 - (current_column % 4)  # Calculate spaces to next 4-column position
            current_column += num_spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, when encountering a tab character `\t`, the function calculates the number of spaces needed to reach the next 4-column position and increments the `current_column` accordingly. This adjustment ensures that the tabs are handled consistently, avoiding the indentation issue highlighted in the GitHub report.
