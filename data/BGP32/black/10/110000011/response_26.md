### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for processing a given prefix string character by character and adjusting the indentation level. The issue reported on GitHub highlights a problem with incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent operation, which suggests that the indentation logic within the function is flawed.

### Error Locations:
1. The logic for handling tab characters (`\t`) in the function does not account for the correct column adjustment when encountering tabs.
2. The condition for identifying the end of an indentation block (`wait_for_nl`) might not be triggered accurately in all cases, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the function's inability to properly manage indentation changes when encountering tab characters and accurately detecting the end of an indentation block. This results in incorrect indentation adjustments when dedenting, as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the column count correctly when encountering a tab character.
2. Ensure that the `wait_for_nl` condition is set appropriately to detect the end of an indentation block accurately.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = ((current_column // 4) + 1) * 4  # Adjust column count for tabs
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Bug Fix Explanation:
In the corrected version:
1. When encountering a tab character (`\t`), the column count is adjusted to the next multiple of 4 to match tab expansions.
2. The logic for setting `wait_for_nl` is modified to capture the end of an indentation block accurately, ensuring correct handling of comments and dedents.

By applying these fixes, the function should now correctly process the prefix string and adjust the indentation level as expected, resolving the reported issue on GitHub.
