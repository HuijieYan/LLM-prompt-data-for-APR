### Analysis:
1. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` in the `Driver` class is responsible for processing the input prefix character by character and handling indentation based on spaces, tabs, and newlines.
2. The GitHub issue highlights a problem where the indentation for comments after a dedent is incorrectly changed when tabs are used in the input code.
3. The bug seems to occur when waiting for a newline after encountering spaces or tabs. If a new line is found, the function expects the current line to be processed correctly, which leads to incorrect indentation handling.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in `_partially_consume_prefix` to correctly handle the indentation in all scenarios, especially after a dedent.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Introduce a flag to track whether we are in the middle of processing a line waiting for a new line.
2. When encountering a new line or reaching the end of the prefix, check and adjust the current line's indentation based on the provided column value.
3. Ensure that the correct amount of whitespace (spaces or tabs) is added for the next line or comment based on the current indentation level.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                # Adjust indentation when encountering newline
                if not current_column:
                    current_column = column
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should address the issue described in the GitHub report by ensuring correct indentation handling after a dedent, especially when dealing with tabulated comments.
