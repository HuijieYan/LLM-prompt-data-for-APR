### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` in the `Driver` class is supposed to handle partial consumption of a prefix string while maintaining indentation levels. The bug reported on GitHub is related to incorrect indentation changes for tabulated comments after a dedent. This bug is likely due to how indentation levels are handled in the function.

### Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of tab characters leading to incorrect indentation levels for comments.
2. Incorrect condition checks that determine when to adjust the indentation level.
3. Lack of proper handling for tab characters causing unexpected behavior.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not handle tab characters properly during indentation calculation. When encountering tabs, the function increments the current column by a fixed value of 4, which results in incorrect calculations for indentation levels, especially when dealing with tabulated comments after a dedent.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to accurately handle tab characters in the input prefix string and adjust the indentation level accordingly. This involves correctly interpreting tabs to ensure that the indentation is consistent with the original input.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\t':
                char = ' ' * (4 - (current_column % 4))  # Handle tab characters
            
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version:
- Tab characters are correctly handled by converting each tab to the appropriate number of spaces based on the current indentation level.
- Indentation calculations are adjusted accordingly to handle tabs and spaces appropriately.
- The function now maintains the correct indentation levels, ensuring consistent behavior for comments after dedents.

This corrected version should address the bug reported on GitHub regarding incorrect indentation changes for tabulated comments after a dedent.
