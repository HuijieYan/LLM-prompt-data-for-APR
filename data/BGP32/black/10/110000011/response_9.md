### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is related to handling indentation in the context of text parsing. The function is meant to consume part of a prefix string based on certain indentation rules.

### Identified potential error locations:
1. The logic for handling tabs (`'\t'`) in the function might be causing the issue of incorrect indentation.
2. The logic for updating the `current_column` value based on different characters might be inconsistent.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug described in the GitHub issue seems to be related to the incorrect handling of tabulated comments after a dedent. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is involved in processing text based on indentation levels, and the logic for handling tabs and updating the `current_column` value might be causing the indentation issue when using tabs.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic related to tab handling and the update of the `current_column` value. Specifically, we need to ensure that tabulated comments after a dedent maintain the correct indentation level.

### Corrected Version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            next_tab_stop = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
            current_column = next_tab_stop
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Changes made in the corrected version:
- Updated the logic for handling tabs (`'\t'`) to calculate the next tab stop based on the current column value.
- Adjusted the update of the `current_column` value to maintain correct indentation levels even after a dedent, specifically for tabulated comments.
- The corrected version aims to address the issue of incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
