### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for tracking the indentation level of code lines and handling comments. The issue described in the GitHub report indicates that when the input file uses tabs, the indentation for comments past depth 0 is incorrectly changed after a dedent. This problem arises due to the handling of tab characters in the function.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of tab characters in the function.
2. Incorrect calculation of the current indentation level.
3. Incorrect handling of comments that break the expected indentation level.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not properly interpret tab characters in the input prefix, leading to incorrect indentation calculation. This results in the incorrect adjustment of the comments' indentation level after a dedent operation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that tab characters are correctly handled in the function. We should accurately calculate the indentation level based on spaces and tabs, adjusting it appropriately for comments.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            char = ' ' * 4  # Convert tabs to 4 spaces for consistent indentation
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Changes Made:
1. Added a conversion of tab characters to 4 spaces to ensure consistent indentation.
2. Modified the handling of tab characters in the function to maintain correct indentation levels.
3. Removed unnecessary conditions and adjusted the logic for handling comments.

By applying these modifications, the corrected version of the function should resolve the issue described in the GitHub report related to incorrect comment indentation.
