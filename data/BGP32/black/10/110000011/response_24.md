### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for handling indentation of comments in a Python file.
- The GitHub issue indicates that there is a problem with maintaining the correct indentation for comments after a dedent when the input file uses tabs.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The logic for handling indentation levels and waiting for a new line in the function could lead to incorrect behavior.
2. Keeping track of the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` flags might not work correctly in all scenarios.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug causing incorrect indentation changes for tabulated comments after a dedent is likely due to the way the function `_partially_consume_prefix` handles the processing of prefix characters in the input file. The logic for determining the correct indentation level and managing the transition from one line to the next may not account for the presence of tab characters appropriately.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the function correctly interprets tab characters and calculates the correct indentation level based on tabs.
2. Verify that the logic for detecting the end of a line and waiting for a new line to handle comments is working as expected.
3. Consider refactoring the function to simplify the logic and make it more robust against different scenarios.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    current_line += char
            else:
                current_line += char
        elif char == ' ':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char

    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
        lines.append(current_line)
        current_line = ""

    return '\n'.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version of the function has been adjusted to handle tabs correctly and maintain the correct indentation level for comments after a dedent. It improves the logic for processing each character in the prefix and ensures that comments are handled appropriately.
