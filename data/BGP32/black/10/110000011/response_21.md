### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for handling prefix indentation but has a flaw causing issues with tabulation handling.
- The function is part of the `Driver` class in the `blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py` file.

### Error Locations:
1. The function is incorrectly handling the tab character (`\t`) in the prefix.
2. The incorrect handling of the tab character leads to inconsistent column tracking.
3. The improper logic results in incorrect prefix consumption and subsequent return values.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises due to the mishandling of tab characters (`\t`) in the prefix. The function counts each tab character as 4 spaces when calculating the column position. This inconsistency causes discrepancies in the prefix parsing and results in incorrect indentation levels for comments after a dedent, as described in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the tab character column calculation to accurately reflect the size of a tab.
2. Update the logic to handle tab characters appropriately to ensure correct column tracking.
3. Modify the function to consume prefixes correctly, accounting for tab characters in the input.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    # Correctly handle tab character for column tracking
                    num_tabs = current_column // 4
                    current_column = num_tabs * 4
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                # Adjust column based on tab size
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the tab character calculation issue, providing more accurate column tracking and ensuring proper prefix consumption. With these adjustments, the function should handle indentation correctly and resolve the problem described in the GitHub issue.
