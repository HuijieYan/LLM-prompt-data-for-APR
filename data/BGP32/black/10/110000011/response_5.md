### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` in the `Driver` class is responsible for processing a given prefix based on certain rules, such as handling indentation and new lines. However, as per the GitHub issue, there is an incorrect behavior related to handling tabulated comments after a dedent. This can lead to incorrect line indentation in the output.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of tabs in the input prefix.
2. Calculation of column offset and handling of different types of characters.
3. Incorrect logic for waiting to reset the current line for comments.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect calculation of column offset when encountering tabs in the prefix. The function does not properly consider the impact of tabs on the column count, leading to misaligned comments after a dedent.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for calculating the column offset when encountering tabs in the input prefix. By correctly handling tabs, we can ensure that the column count accurately reflects the indentation levels, preventing misalignment of comments.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            tab_width = 4
            num_spaces = tab_width - (current_column % tab_width)
            current_line += ' ' * num_spaces
            current_column += num_spaces
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version:
1. We added a section to handle tabs properly by calculating the number of spaces needed to align the text correctly.
2. Adjusted the logic to increment the `current_column` correctly based on tabs and spaces.
3. Addressed the incorrect indentation issue after a dedent by ensuring that tabulated comments are correctly aligned. 

By making these adjustments, the corrected function should now handle tabulated comments after a dedent accurately, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
