### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` in the `Driver` class is responsible for handling the indentation of code lines and comments. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the code indentation is being incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent operation.

### Potential Error Locations:
- The condition under which `wait_for_nl` is set to True might not be working correctly.
- Handling of tabs and spaces for indentation might be causing the issue.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be related to how the function handles different types of indentation characters (spaces, tabs) and the logic for detecting when to wait for a new line. This is affecting the correct identification of the next comment line's indentation level.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the function correctly tracks the indentation level after a dedent operation.
2. Verify the logic for detecting new line characters and waiting for the next line's indentation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    line_length = len(current_line.expandtabs())
                    if line_length < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Changes Made:
1. Used `expandtabs()` to calculate the actual length of the line considering tab characters.
2. Updated the logic for checking the indentation level to ensure correct handling after dedent operations.
3. Adjusted the `if` condition to check if the line length is less than the expected column instead of checking if it is greater.
