### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for the incorrect handling of indentation in the given GitHub issue. The function tries to detect the indentation level of each line in the input `prefix` string but has issues when encountering tabs.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The logic for handling tabs in the `prefix` string seems to be incorrect, leading to the misinterpretation of indentation levels.
2. The condition for `wait_for_nl` might not be properly toggled, causing the function to skip lines incorrectly.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is that the function fails to correctly handle tabs as indentation characters when calculating the correct column position. Due to this, the function incorrectly identifies the indentation level of lines in the prefix string, leading to incorrect output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function accurately tracks the indentation levels, especially when tabs are present in the input string. The function should correctly interpret tabs as equivalent to 4 spaces for indentation purposes.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # Ensure tabs increment by 4 spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version of the function, the handling of tabs has been modified to align with the standard behavior of considering a tab as equivalent to 4 spaces for indentation. This adjustment ensures that the function correctly calculates the column positions and handles the indentation in the input string as expected.

By updating the function logic to account for tabs properly, the bug related to incorrect indentation changes should be resolved, addressing the GitHub issue.
