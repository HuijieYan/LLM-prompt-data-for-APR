### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for consuming a prefix string and correctly handling the indentation of the lines. The function tracks the column position of the prefix string as it processes each character. The bug appears to be related to incorrect handling of indentation levels, particularly with tabs.

### Error Location:
The error likely occurs when the function encounters tab characters (`\t`) in the prefix. This is where the incorrect calculation of the `current_column` may lead to issues.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the function to misinterpret the indentation level when encountering tab characters, leading to incorrect alignment of comments after dedent operations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the calculation of the `current_column` accurately reflects the actual column position when tabs are encountered. This involves correctly handling tab characters in terms of column adjustments.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl :
                if char != ' ' and char != '\t':
                    wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # Adjust column for tab
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True

            if current_column > column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Explanation:
In the corrected version, I adjusted the handling of tab characters by aligning the column calculation correctly. When encountering a tab character, the column position is now adjusted according to the tab size. This modification ensures that the function accurately tracks the column position for correct indentation handling.

By incorporating these changes, the corrected function should now properly consume the prefix string and maintain the correct indentation level, addressing the issue reported on GitHub related to incorrect change in indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
