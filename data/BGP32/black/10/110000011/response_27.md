### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming a prefix based on given columns.
2. The bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of columns and newline characters, which leads to incorrect indentation for the comments in the GitHub issue.
3. The issue arises due to the mishandling of tabs and indentation levels in the function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that tabs are treated correctly and the function maintains the correct column count when encountering indentations and newline characters.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Correctly handle tabs and increment the `current_column` by 4 for each tab character encountered.
2. Ensure that when a newline character is encountered, the `current_column` is reset to 0.
3. Update the logic for handling characters to correctly identify the position of the comment and maintain the correct columns.
4. Avoid trimming whitespaces in lines and properly align the comments with the code indentation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                indent = len(lines[-1]) if lines else 0
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line + ' ' * (indent - 1))  # Adjust comment indentation
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue related to incorrect comment indentation after dedent operations.
