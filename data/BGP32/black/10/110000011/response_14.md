### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for processing a prefix text string and partially consuming it based on certain conditions. The function deals with indentation levels and special characters like spaces, tabs, and new lines.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of indentation levels after a deduction.
2. Incorrect calculation of columns when encountering tabs.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug reported on GitHub indicates that the indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent. The issue arises when processing a text file that includes tabs for indentation. The current implementation of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function does not handle tab characters correctly, leading to indentation errors.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Adjust the logic related to tab characters to ensure that proper column calculation is done.
2. Ensure that the function correctly maintains the indentation levels, especially after dedent operations.
3. The function should handle tabs in a way that aligns with the intended indentation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Adjust column calculation for tab
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version of the function adjusts the column calculation logic when encountering tab characters. By appropriately handling tabs, the function should now process the prefix text string accurately and maintain the correct indentation levels, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
