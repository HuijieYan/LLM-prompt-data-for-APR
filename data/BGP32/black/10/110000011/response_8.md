## Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` in the `Driver` class is designed to partially consume a prefix string until a certain column is reached. However, the logic inside the function seems to be incorrectly handling indentation levels represented by spaces and tabs. This issue directly relates to the GitHub problem titled "Indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent."

## Identified error locations:
1. Incorrect handling of the tab character `\t` causing the calculation of `current_column` to be off when encountering tabs.
2. The logic for waiting for a new line should trigger after a proper indent has been consumed, not at the first white space encountered.

## Bug explanation:
When the function encounters a tab character in the prefix string, it increments `current_column` by 4, assuming a tab equals four spaces. This assumption leads to incorrect column calculation, causing misalignment and incorrect handling of indentation levels for tabulated comments.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Use the `expandtabs` function to replace tab characters with spaces based on Python's default tab spacing, to correctly calculate the number of spaces for each tab.
2. Refactor the logic related to `wait_for_nl` to trigger the new line check after a proper indent has been consumed, ensuring correct handling of indentation levels.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix.replace('\t', ' ' * 4):  # Replace tabs with spaces
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should address the issues causing incorrect handling of tabulated comments after a dedent and ensure proper indentation alignment.
