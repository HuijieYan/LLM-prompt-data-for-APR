Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The logic for handling tabs ('\t') may not be correctly updating the current column when encountering a tab character.
2. The condition for resetting the current line and column after encountering a new line character ('\n') may not be working as intended.
3. The logic for appending to the 'lines' list and creating the final result may need adjustments.

Explanation of the bug:
Based on the GitHub issue, the problem seems to be related to incorrect handling of tabulated comments after a dedent. This suggests that the buggy function is not correctly preserving the original formatting when encountering tab characters.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the current column updates correctly when encountering a tab character ('\t').
2. Update the logic for handling new line characters ('\n') to reset the current line and column appropriately.
3. Adjust the logic for appending to the 'lines' list to correctly capture the original formatting of tabulated comments.

## Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Update the column count when encountering a tab character
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip():  # Check if the line is not empty before resetting
                lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    if current_line.strip():  # Append any remaining non-empty line
        lines.append(current_line)
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making these adjustments, the corrected function should now handle the preservation of the original indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent correctly.
