## Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` in the `Driver` class seems to have issues with handling tabs and newlines correctly when calculating the indentation level for comments. This is causing the indentation to be incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent. This bug has been reported in the GitHub issue mentioned.

## Identified issues:
1. The function does not handle tabs ('\t') correctly when calculating the column position.
2. The logic for detecting when to wait for a newline ('\n') is not working as expected, leading to incorrect behavior.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused due to incorrect handling of tabs and newlines in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. The function is not correctly adjusting the current column position when encountering tabs, leading to errors in calculating the correct indentation level.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Adjust the logic for handling tabs ('\t') to increment the current column by 4 instead of 1.
2. Revise the logic for waiting for a newline ('\n') to correctly identify the end of the indentation block.

## Corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            current_column += 1
            
        current_line += char
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:  # Corrected condition
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            pass
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the changes as suggested above, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now correctly handle tabs and newlines, ensuring that the indentation for tabulated comments is not incorrectly changed after a dedent.
