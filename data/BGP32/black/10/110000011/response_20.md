## Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming a prefix until a specific column.
- The function is designed to handle indentation and check for specific characters like tabs, spaces, and new lines.
- The bug reported in the GitHub issue indicates that the indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent.
- The function is likely causing the indentation issue when processing tabs due to how it handles the different characters.
- The issue mentioned in the GitHub report is related to how the function handles tab characters and indentations.


## Bug Cause:
- The bug in the function is likely caused by the way the function handles tabs (`'\t'`) in the input prefix.
- The function increases the `current_column` by 4 for each tab character encountered, which may lead to incorrect column counts for subsequent characters.
- This incorrect handling of tabs can result in incorrect indentation after a dedent operation, leading to the reported issue.


## Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles tabs and maintains the correct column count for indentation purposes.
- Instead of directly incrementing `current_column` by 4 for each tab, we should calculate the appropriate indentation based on the current column and tab position.

## Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                # Calculate the remaining spaces to reach the next tab stop
                tab_stop = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
                spaces_to_add = tab_stop - current_column
                current_column = tab_stop
                current_line += ' ' * spaces_to_add
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

In the corrected version:
- When encountering a tab character, we correctly calculate the remaining spaces needed to reach the next tab stop.
- We add the appropriate number of spaces to the `current_line` to maintain correct indentation.
- This adjustment ensures that the function handles tab characters properly and maintains the correct column count, resolving the reported issue.
