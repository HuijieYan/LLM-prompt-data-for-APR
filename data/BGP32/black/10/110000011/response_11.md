### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for handling the indentation of lines based on a given prefix and a specified column. The function is used in the `blib2to3` library for some specific purpose related to parsing. The error mentioned in the GitHub issue is related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The handling of tab characters (`\t`) regarding indentation calculation.
2. Checking when to wait for a new line (`wait_for_nl`) might not be properly triggered.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of tabs for indentation levels in the `prefix`. The function does not handle tabs properly in the calculation of the indentation level, leading to the incorrect behavior described in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Adjust the calculation of the indentation level based on the tab characters in the `prefix`.
2. Ensure that the function correctly detects when to wait for a new line based on the indentation level.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            num_spaces = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_column += num_spaces
            current_line += ' ' * num_spaces
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
        
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, I have added a check for tab characters that correctly adjusts the indentation level based on the number of spaces needed. This should address the issue related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
