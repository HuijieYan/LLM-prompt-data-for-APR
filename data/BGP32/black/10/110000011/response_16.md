## Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for handling the indentation and line continuation while processing the input text. The GitHub issue suggests that there is an incorrect handling of indentation for comments after dedent when tabs are used.

## Error location:
The bug seems to be related to how the function handles tab characters '\t' and potentially the logic for keeping track of the current column indentation level.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because when encountering a tab character '\t', the function currently adds 4 to the current column, assuming a tab equals 4 spaces. However, this assumption may not hold true for all cases, especially when dealing with code that uses tabs for indentation.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the function should accurately account for the correct number of spaces equivalent to a tab character '\t'. It should also ensure that the indentation level for comments after a dedent is preserved correctly.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
class Driver(object):
    
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))  # Adjust column based on current position
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version of the function, the tab handling logic has been updated to adjust the column based on the current position within the line. This adjustment helps maintain the correct indentation level when tabs are used.
