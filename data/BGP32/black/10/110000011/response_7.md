## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to process the `prefix` string character by character, keeping track of the current line being constructed, current column, and handling tabulation and indentation.
2. The GitHub issue indicates a problem with indentation of comments when tabs are used in the input file.
3. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of tabulation characters ('\t') in the function, leading to incorrect indentation changes after dedents.
4. A strategy to fix the bug would involve correctly adjusting the tabulation-related logic to ensure proper handling of tabs and indentations in the code.

## Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                indent_spaces = len(lines[-1]) - len(lines[-1].lstrip())
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column + indent_spaces:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Update the tabulation to match 4 spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version improves the handling of tab characters ('\t') by adjusting the tabulation logic to increase the column count by 4 spaces to match Python's standard tab width. This adjustment should help maintain correct indentation levels, especially when dealing with comments after dedents.
