### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is supposed to partially consume a prefix of a string based on a specified column. 
- The function is intended to handle indentation, tabs, spaces, and newline characters.
- The bug is identified in the incorrect handling of indentation before comments after a dedent.
- The function is failing to correctly adjust the column position while handling comments after dedents.

### Error Cause:
- The function fails to properly handle the case where a comment is present after a dedent, resulting in incorrect indentation for the comment.
- The issue arises from the implementation not accounting for the indentation level when a comment appears after a dedent, and it incorrectly sets the wait_for_nl flag.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Adjust the logic for handling comments after dedents.
- Specifically check for comments while evaluating the indentation level to ensure proper alignment.
- Update the condition for setting the wait_for_nl flag to address the specific case of comments after dedents.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':  # Adjust for comments after dedent
            wait_for_nl = False  # Skip waiting for newline
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Justification:
- Added a condition to skip waiting for a newline when encountering a comment character '#', ensuring correct behavior after dedents with comments.
- The corrected function addresses the specific case mentioned in the GitHub issue where the comment is not correctly aligned after a dedent.
- The updated logic ensures that comments are handled appropriately without disrupting the indentation level.
