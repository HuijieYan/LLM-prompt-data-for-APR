### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string until a certain column limit is reached. However, the current implementation has a bug related to handling indentation and comments. The bug is causing incorrect handling of comments after a dedent. This issue was also reported in the GitHub issue mentioned, stating that the indentation for comments is changing incorrectly after a dedent, especially when using tabs.

### Bug Explanation:
The primary issue stems from the way the function handles tab characters during indentation calculation. Due to the mix of tab characters and spaces in the prefix string, the current implementation fails to correctly calculate the column position. This leads to misalignment when processing comments after a dedent, resulting in incorrect reformatting.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, the function needs to properly handle tab characters during indentation calculation. It must account for the equivalent column positions represented by tabs. By adjusting the logic for tab characters and properly calculating indentation levels, the function can accurately consume the prefix string and maintain the correct column alignment.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))  # Adjust for tab equivalent spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function properly handles tab characters, adjusts the column position for tabs, and ensures correct indentation calculation for comments after a dedent.
