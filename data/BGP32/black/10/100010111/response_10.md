### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string up to a certain column and return the consumed part along with the remaining part of the prefix. The issue in the function seems to be related to handling indentation and newline characters.

#### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect tracking of the `current_column` after encountering a newline character.
2. Incorrectly resetting the `current_column` to `0` when encountering a newline character.
3. Failure to consider and preserve indentation before a comment.
4. Incorrectly handling the condition for waiting for a newline character.

### Bug Explanation
The bug causes incorrect handling of indentation when encountering comment lines. It doesn't properly track the current column position after a newline and fails to maintain the correct indentation for the comment lines as expected.

In the failing test case, the function incorrectly adjusts the comment indentation, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual values.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Ensure correct tracking of `current_column` after encountering a newline character.
2. Update the logic for handling indentation before a comment line.
3. Improve the logic for waiting for a newline character.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0  # Reset to zero after encountering a newline
            wait_for_nl = True  # Set to True to wait for the next newline
        else:
            if current_column < column:
                return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines))]
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making these adjustments, the corrected function should now properly handle the indentation before comment lines and maintain the expected behavior for the given input cases.
