### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string up to a certain column, taking into account spaces, tabs, and new lines.
- The issue arises when handling indentation for comments following dedents. The bug occurs when the comment indentation is modified after a dedent, resulting in incorrect formatting.
- The failing test in the error message indicates a mismatch due to improper handling of comment indentation.
- The expected input/output values for the failing test cases have been provided.
- The GitHub issue highlights a scenario where tabulated comments' indentation is altered after a dedent operation, which aligns with the failing test cases.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug arises when `wait_for_nl` is set to `True`, indicating an expectation for a new line following an indent, and this logic incorrectly alters the comment indentation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Adjust the indentation handling logic to preserve comment alignment after dedents, ensuring that comments are correctly formatted in relation to the surrounding code.
- Ensure that comments are not affected by changes in indentation levels.
- Refine the logic surrounding new lines and comment handling to maintain the appropriate structure.
- Update the function to accurately parse and handle prefixes with comments and different levels of indentation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if '#' in current_line:
                wait_for_nl = True
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = False

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic within the function to handle the parsing of prefixes with comments and diverse indentation levels more accurately, the corrected version should resolve the bug identified in the failing test cases and the GitHub issue mentioned.
