### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming a prefix string based on the given column value.
2. The function processes the prefix character by character and determines the current line based on spaces, tabs, and newlines.
3. The bug appears when handling tab characters followed by comments ('#'). It fails to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent.
4. The expected output is the remaining prefix string after consuming the indentation for the comment.
5. The failing test indicates a mismatch between the expected and actual output, showing the incorrect handling of comments after dedent.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function fails to adjust the indentation for comments (`'#'`) when there is a dedent (decrease in indentation level). This leads to comments being incorrectly aligned after a dedent in specific cases, as seen in the failing test.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function accurately handles the indentation changes for comments, especially after a dedent operation. Adjusting the logic related to computing the indentation level after a dedent should resolve the issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            if current_line.strip().startswith('#'):
                wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By modifying the tab character handling and specifically ensuring the correct adjustment of the current indentation level after a dedent, the corrected version of the function should now accurately handle comments alignment after dedent operations.
