### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix string until a certain column limit is reached. The issue arises when the function encounters a comment line after dedentations. The function incorrectly assumes an unexpected empty line when it encounters a '\n' character within a comment. This bug leads to incorrect handling of comment indentation.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the function to mishandle the indentation of comments after dedentation. The function wrongly resets the `current_column` to 0 when encountering a '\n' within a comment line, leading to incorrect comment indentation.

### Fix Strategy:
- Ensure that when the function encounters a comment within the loop, it should only affect the indentation of the comment, not reset the `current_column`.
- Update the logic to handle comment lines correctly without interfering with the column count.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            current_line += char
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected function adjusts the logic to properly handle comment lines without resetting `current_column`. It ensures that the comment indentation is handled correctly after dedentations.
