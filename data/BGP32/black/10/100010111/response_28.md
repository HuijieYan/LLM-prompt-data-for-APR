### Analysis:
The issue is related to incorrect handling of comments indentation after dedent. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for processing the prefix string character by character, keeping track of indentation level and lines. The bug occurs when a comment is encountered after dedenting, leading to incorrect indentation for the comment.

### Identified Bug:
The bug arises from the logic where the function sets `wait_for_nl = True` after encountering a non-space character, assuming that it indicates the end of an indentation block. However, this logic fails when a comment is encountered after dedenting, resulting in incorrect indentation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for identifying the end of an indentation block. Instead of setting `wait_for_nl = True` immediately, we should only set it to true if a non-space or non-tab character is encountered while not waiting for newline. This will prevent premature termination of the current indentation block.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = not (char == '#' or char.isspace())
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the condition for setting `wait_for_nl`, we ensure that comments after dedent are handled correctly, leading to proper indentation of comments as expected.
