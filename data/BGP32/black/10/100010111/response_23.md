### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix until a certain column is reached.
- The function incorrectly handles updating the `current_column` when encountering a newline character. This causes the issue with incorrect line indentation for comments after a dedent.
- The `wait_for_nl` flag is used to determine whether to wait for a newline character or not. However, it is not reset after appending a line to `lines`.
- The current implementation doesn't handle the case where the prefix ends with a newline character.
- The function doesn't consider the specified column for handling the indentation.
- Overall, the incorrect handling of newline characters and indentation results in misaligned comments after dedent in the code.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Reset the `wait_for_nl` flag after appending a line to `lines`.
2. Update the `current_column` considering the specified column for proper indentation.
3. Handle the case where the prefix ends with a newline character.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After correcting the function, it should now handle the indentation of comments correctly after a dedent. This fix should address the reported issue on GitHub.
