### Analysis:
- The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to handle indentation levels in code snippets.
- The function maintains a list `lines` to store partially consumed lines.
- The current line being processed is stored in `current_line`.
- `current_column` tracks the current column for indentation.
- The flag `wait_for_nl` is used to handle waiting for a new line character after an indentation level.
- The function checks for spaces, tabs, and new line characters to adjust the indentation level.
- The bug seems to occur when processing and consuming prefix text with comments.
- The expected output is not being correctly generated due to incorrect indentation handling for comments.

### Potential Error:
- The bug seems to occur in cases where there is a comment right after a dedent operation.
- The function might be incorrectly resetting the `current_column` value after a new line character check, leading to incorrect indentation levels.

### Bug Explanation:
- The bug occurs when the function encounters a new line character (`\n`) followed by a comment.
- The function wrongly resets the `current_column` value to 0 for the new line, impacting the correct handling of comment indentation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Adjust the logic for handling new line characters followed by comments.
- Preserve the previous `current_column` value when encountering a new line before a comment.
- Ensure that comment indentation matches the actual code block.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if prefix[prefix.index(char) + 1:].lstrip().startswith('#'):
                wait_for_nl = True
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Summary:
- The corrected function modifies the behavior of handling new line characters followed by comments.
- It ensures that the comment indentation is correctly aligned with the code structure.
- The corrected function should now generate the expected output for the failing test case and resolve the GitHub issue related to incorrect comment indentation.
