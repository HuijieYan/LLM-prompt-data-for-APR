### Analysis and bug explanation
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` aims to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column value. The bug arises due to mishandling of indentation levels when a comment occurs after a dedent in the input string. The function incorrectly sets the `wait_for_nl` flag before handling the indent change, causing the comment indentation to be incorrectly calculated.

The error message indicates an AssertionError in the test `test_comment_indentation`. The test compares the expected formatted string `contents_spc` with the output of the function applied to `contents_tab`. The discrepancy occurs due to the incorrect handling of comments with leading spaces in the input string.

### Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly manage the `wait_for_nl` flag and handle the calculation of indentation level changes, especially for comments. Adjust the logic to properly handle cases where comments follow an indent change in the input string.

### The corrected version of the function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The correction involves moving the `wait_for_nl` check after updating the `current_line` to ensure proper handling of indentation changes before considering comments. This adjustment should address the incorrect handling of comments' indentation following a dedent in the input string.
