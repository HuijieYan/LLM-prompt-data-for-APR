### Analysis
- The `wait_for_nl` variable is not being reset to False after finding a new line character.
- When encountering a new line character, it is resetting `current_column` to 0, which causes the incorrect calculation of indentation for comments.
- The implementation does not handle cases where the `column` value matches the indentation level properly.

### Bug Cause
The bug causes incorrect handling of comment indentation in a code string. The current implementation resets the `current_column` to 0 every time a new line character is encountered. It incorrectly identifies the indentation level when there are comments exactly at the specified `column` position. The logic to handle the indentation and comments is flawed.

### Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that `wait_for_nl` is set to False after encountering a new line character.
2. Adjust the handling of `current_column` for comments to correctly calculate the indentation level.
3. Properly handle cases where the `column` value matches the indentation level.

### Corrected Implementation
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected function ensures that the comments are correctly indented based on the specified `column` value without resetting the `current_column` improperly. It addresses the bug by resetting `wait_for_nl` and adjusting the logic for handling comments and indentation.
