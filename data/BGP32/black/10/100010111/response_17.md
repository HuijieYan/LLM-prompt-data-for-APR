### Analysis and Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function when handling tab characters (`\t`) and spaces. The issue arises when the current column is not correctly updated to reflect tabs and spaces, resulting in incorrect line indentation.

The function fails to correctly handle tab characters while calculating the current column position. When encountering a tab character, it should increment the `current_column` by 4, but it is only incrementing it by 1. This leads to incorrect column tracking, causing the issue discussed in the GitHub problem description.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to accurately update the `current_column` based on the characters encountered in the `prefix` string. Specifically, when encountering a tab character (`\t`), we need to increment `current_column` by 4 to align with the expected behavior indicated in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Updated to increment by 4 for tabs
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After making this correction, the function should now accurately track the current column position accounting for tab characters, resolving the issue of incorrect comment indentation after a dedent.
