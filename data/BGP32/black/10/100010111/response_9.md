### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to process a given prefix string based on indentation and return the consumed portion and the remaining portion.
2. The function encounters an issue where the indentation for comments is not handled correctly after a dedent operation when using tabs.
3. The expected cases provided highlight the incorrect behavior of the function in cases involving tab characters and comments.
4. The bug seems to occur due to the mishandling of tab characters and resetting the indentation level after encountering a newline character.
5. To fix the bug, the logic for handling tabs and maintaining correct indentation levels for comments needs to be revised.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the handling of tab characters to properly update the current_column based on the number of tab spaces.
2. Ensure that the correct indentation level is maintained for comments, especially after dedent operations.
3. Update the logic to correctly handle the scenario when a comment follows an indent level lower than the specified column.

### Bug-fixed Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assume each tab is equivalent to 4 spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying the above fixes, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should behave correctly and pass the failing test cases, including those related to tab indentation and comments.
