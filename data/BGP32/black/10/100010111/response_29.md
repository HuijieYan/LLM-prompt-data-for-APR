### Analysis:
The provided buggy function, `_partially_consume_prefix`, is intended to consume a given prefix string up to a certain column, considering spaces and tab characters for column calculations. The function seems to have issues when encountering a '\n' character, leading to incorrect behavior regarding indentation levels. This issue is reflected in the failing test, which compares formatted outputs using spaces and tabs.

### Identified potential error locations:
1. The handling of newline characters seems to be causing the incorrect behavior in the function.
2. The tracking of `wait_for_nl` flag might not be correctly transitioning back to the normal state.
3. Incorrect logic for updating `current_column` under specific conditions.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug appears to be related to how the function handles newline characters and maintains the correct indentation level. When encountering a newline character, the function should reset the `current_column` count to accurately consider the start of new lines and maintain proper indentation levels.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Reset `current_column` whenever a newline character is encountered.
2. Adjust the logic related to `wait_for_nl` flag to handle indentation properly after newline characters.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:  
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying the corrections, the function should now properly handle newline characters and maintain accurate indentation levels. This should allow the function to pass the failing test case provided.
