### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is meant to partially consume a prefix string until a specific column while handling indentation, tabs, and new lines.
- The error message indicates that the function is not correctly handling comments indentation after a dedent.
- The function tracks lines, current line, current column, and a flag `wait_for_nl` to detect new lines.
- Potential issues:
  1. The condition to check if `char == '\n'` is resetting the `current_column` to 0 even for comments lines, causing incorrect formatting.
  2. The condition to check if `char == '\n'` should only reset `current_column` when it's not within a comment.
- The expected output indicates the correct behavior after a dedent, especially for comments, to align with the provided test cases.
- The GitHub issue relates to a specific case of incorrect comment indentation after a dedent, which is connected to how comments and indentations are handled.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs due to the unconditional resetting of `current_column` to 0 whenever encountering a new line (`char == '\n'`). This leads to incorrect comment indentation.

### Fix Strategy:
- Update the condition for resetting `current_column` to handle comments separately, ensuring that comment lines maintain their indentation.
- Adjust the logic to correctly track column positions, especially after dedents and new lines to preserve indentation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    in_comment = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                in_comment = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '#':
            in_comment = True
        elif char == '\n':
            if not in_comment:  # Skip resetting column if in comment
                current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version adjusts the logic to skip resetting `current_column` when encountering a new line character within a comment, ensuring correct comment indentation after dedents.
