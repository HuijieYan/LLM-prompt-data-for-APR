### Correction and Explanation:

The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is mainly related to the handling of indentation levels and newlines when processing the prefix string. The function incorrectly handles the situation where there is a comment following an indented block.

The issue originates from the incorrect logic in the `wait_for_nl` section of the code. The buggy code incorrectly assumes that when encountering a non-space character after an indent, it should wait for a newline to check the column level. However, this leads to incorrect handling when there is a comment that is not directly preceded by a newline.

To fix this bug, the logic should be adjusted to correctly handle the indentation level calculation when encountering different characters in the prefix string.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == '#':
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now properly handle the indentation levels and terminate correctly at the expected points, resolving the incorrect behavior that leads to wrongly formatted comments. The corrected function aligns with the expected input/output values and addresses the reported issue on GitHub.
