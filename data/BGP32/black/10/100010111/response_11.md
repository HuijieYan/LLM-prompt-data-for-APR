### Analysis:
1. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to handle indentation in a given prefix string based on the specified column number. It iterates through the prefix string character by character to determine the correct indentation based on spaces, tabs, and newlines.
2. The error message indicates a mismatch between the expected and actual output. It specifically points out the incorrect indentation for the comment after the `pass` statement in the given test case.
3. The root cause of the bug seems to be the incorrect handling of tabs for comments after dedents in the prefix string. The function does not properly handle the indentation levels for tabs, resulting in misaligned comments.
4. To fix the bug, the function needs modification to correctly handle tab characters and adjust the indentation levels accordingly.
5. We need to update the logic in the function to accurately calculate the indentation levels, especially when encountering tabs.

### Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic related to tab characters in the prefix. We should be mindful of the tab width (typically considered as 4 spaces) and ensure proper alignment when processing the prefix string.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    tab_width = 4  # Define tab width for consistent indentation
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += tab_width - (current_column % tab_width)
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

        current_line += char
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the logic related to tab characters and using a consistent tab width, the corrected function should now handle the indentation correctly for tabulated comments after a dedent. This updated version aims to pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output values.
