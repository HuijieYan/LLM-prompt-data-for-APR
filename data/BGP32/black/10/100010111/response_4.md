### Analysis:
The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is meant to process and consume a part of the prefix text until certain column indentation is reached. However, the function has a bug where it incorrectly handles the case of an inline comment following a dedent. This leads to incorrect spacing issues.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug triggers when the function encounters a tab character ('\t') inside the prefix. It incorrectly calculates the `current_column` value, leading to incorrect behavior when an inline comment is encountered after a dedent.

### Bug Location:
The bug is likely located in the section where the function handles tabs ('\t') and increases the `current_column` by 4. The calculation of the column position is not considering the actual number of characters used by the tab ('\t') in Python.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the `current_column` is calculated, ensuring that the tab character ('\t') is correctly accounted for. We can replace each tab character ('\t') with four spaces to calculate the correct `current_column` value.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix.replace('\t', '    '):  # Replace tab with 4 spaces for correct indent calculation
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Increase column position considering tab ('\t') as 4 spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By replacing each tab character with four spaces before calculating the `current_column` value, we can ensure correct handling of indentation during prefix consumption. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and resolve the spacing issue mentioned in the GitHub issue.
