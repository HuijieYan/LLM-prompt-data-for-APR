### Analysis:
- The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix up to a certain column.
- The bug appears to be related to handling tabs and spaces as part of indentation in the input prefix.
- The incorrect handling of tabs and spaces is causing the issue with indentation for comments after a dedent.
- The function seems to have issues with tracking the correct column position while consuming the prefix.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is due to the incorrect calculation of columns and handling of tabs and spaces during the prefix consumption. This leads to incorrect indentation when a dedent occurs, specifically with tabulated comments.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to properly handle tabs and spaces within the prefix based on the given column requirements. Adjust the column calculation mechanism to accurately track the indentation level for all scenarios, including both tabs and spaces.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should now accurately handle tabs and spaces in the prefix, ensuring correct tracking of the column position and indentation level. The function should now pass the failing test case and resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to incorrect indentation changes for tabulated comments after a dedent.
