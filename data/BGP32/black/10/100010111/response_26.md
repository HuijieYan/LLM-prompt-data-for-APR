### Analyze the buggy function

- The function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to process the prefix string character by character, adjusting the current line and column as necessary as it encounters different characters.
- The function aims to consume part of the prefix string up to a certain column, excluding any whitespace characters found after reaching the column.
- The current implementation seems to have a logical error in handling the newline character, resulting in incorrect output.
- The test case failure indicates a discrepancy in the output compared to the expected value.
- The error message shows that the formatting of comments is not correct after a dedent operation, specifically related to tabs.

### Identify potential error locations

1. The condition for handling `'\n'` character might be incorrect.
2. The way the function tracks the current column might not be accurate.
3. The logic when `wait_for_nl` is set to True could be problematic.

### Explain the cause of the bug

The bug causes the function to incorrectly handle the newline character when processing the prefix string. This incorrect handling leads to the misalignment of comments after a dedent operation, as evidenced by the failing test case.

The function should correctly identify when to continue parsing a line and when to terminate. The issue is likely related to the `wait_for_nl` flag not being managed correctly in conjunction with handling newline characters and tracking the current column.

### Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the newline characters are processed correctly while taking care of indentation levels. The function should correctly handle the transition from one line to the next, especially after dedent operations. Properly updating the current line, column, and the flags involved should resolve the issue.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = False
            current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version ensures that the function handles newline characters correctly, adjusts the current column based on the detected characters, and correctly tracks the progress through the prefix string. This corrected version should address the indentation issues observed in the failing test case.
