### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a given prefix string while checking and maintaining the correct column indentation. The function processes each character in the prefix string and keeps track of the current line, current column, and whether it needs to wait for a new line character before continuing.

The bug occurs when a comment line is encountered with leading spaces or tabs. The function incorrectly handles the indentation level for the comment lines after a dedent operation, causing the output to differ from the expected results provided in the failing test.

### Bug Cause:
- The `wait_for_nl` flag is not properly handled after encountering a new line character in the input prefix. This leads to incorrect behavior where the comment lines' indentation is altered after a dedent operation.
- When a new line is encountered, the function should reset the current column and handle subsequent characters as part of a new line. It fails to do so in the existing implementation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that after encountering a new line character, the function correctly handles resetting the current column and processes the next characters as part of a new line. This adjustment should maintain the correct indentation level for comment lines even after dedent operations.

### Code Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                if current_line.strip():  # Only append if line is not empty
                    lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the above correction, the function should now correctly handle the indentation for comment lines after dedent operations, resolving the bug highlighted in the failing test case and the GitHub issue.
