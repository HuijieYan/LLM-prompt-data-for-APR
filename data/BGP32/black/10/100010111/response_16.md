### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix string based on indentation. The bug seems to be related to handling comments and indentation changes. The function appears to incorrectly handle tabs and spaces for comments after dedent operations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of tab characters ('\t') and spaces (' ') in the prefix string when dealing with comments. This leads to wrong indentation calculations and affects the final output of the function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how tab characters and spaces are treated when encountering comments. Specifically, proper handling of indentation levels and updating the current column count correctly when encountering different characters ('\n', ' ', '\t').

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ' or char == '\t':
            if wait_for_nl:
                current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else 4
            else:
                current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Correction Rationale:
- Modified the handling of ' ' and '\t' characters to include them only when not waiting for a new line (wait_for_nl is False).
- Adjusted the condition for '\n' to include the check for column count before appending the line.
- Updated the handling of current_line, current_column, and wait_for_nl based on character types encountered in the loop.

By making these modifications, the function should now correctly handle comments and indentation changes, producing the expected output in various cases.
