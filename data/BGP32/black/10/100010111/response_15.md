### Analysis:
- The function `_partially_consume_prefix` aims to consume a prefix string until a certain column value is reached and return the consumed portion.
- The bug seems to be related to incorrectly handling the indentation level for comments after dedent in the prefix.
- It fails to maintain the correct column count for comments after dedent, leading to the misalignment of comments.
- The function has logic to track the column value but fails to handle comments correctly after dedent due to improper handling of tabs and spaces.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the improper calculation of the `current_column` value when encountering comments after dedent. The function incorrectly increments `current_column` without considering the appropriate indentation level of comments following a dedent operation. This leads to misaligned comments in the output.

### Fix Strategy:
- Calculate the correct indentation level when encountering comments after dedent.
- Adjust the `current_column` value based on the preceding indentation level to ensure proper alignment of comments.
- Update the logic to handle tabs and spaces consistently for calculating the column count.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    indent_level = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                indent_level = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming tab width of 4 spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            indent_level = 0
        else:
            # Adjust column count for comments following dedent
            if indent_level > 0:
                current_column = current_column - indent_level
                indent_level = 0
            wait_for_nl = True

            # Update indent level for comments
            if char == '#':
                indent_level = current_column

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected function adjusts the `current_column` value when encountering comments after dedent based on the preceding indentation level. It considers both tabs and spaces for consistent handling of indentation.
