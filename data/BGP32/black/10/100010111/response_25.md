### Analysis:
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is intended to partially consume the prefix string until a certain column limit is reached.
2. The bug occurs when the function encounters a comment line with spaces or tabs after the indentation is finished. It incorrectly consumes the remaining characters leading to indentation issues in the output.
3. The expected behavior is to preserve the comment indentation similar to the regular code indentation.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the condition for handling comments and correctly maintain the indentation levels.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when encountering a comment line after the indentation is finished. The current implementation incorrectly consumes the characters of the comment line, leading to indentation issues in the output. This causes the comment to be aligned differently compared to the regular code indentation.

### Proposed Fix:
Adjust the condition for handling comments so that the function correctly maintains the comment indentation level relative to the code. To achieve this, we need to modify the logic when encountering comment lines within the prefix string.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            if char == '#' and current_column < column:
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                wait_for_nl = False
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying this correction, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now correctly handle comment lines with appropriate indentation relative to the code. This fix should address the indentation issues related to comment lines after the indentation is finished.
