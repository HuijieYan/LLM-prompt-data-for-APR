### Bug Analysis
- The buggy function is `_partially_consume_prefix`.
- The error message indicates a failing test for comment indentation.
- The function is intended to process a prefix string up to a certain column number, handling spaces, tabs, and newlines to correctly determine the indentation levels.
- The function fails to correctly handle the case of a comment after dedent.
- The function fails to adjust the comment indentation leading to the failing test assertion.

### Bug Cause
- The function should correctly handle the case when the comment is after dedent, ensuring it retains the correct indentation level.
- The issue mentioned on GitHub indicates a specific scenario where the comment should maintain the same indentation as the following line after dedent.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Introduce a check to ensure correct handling of comments after dedent.
- Modify the logic to maintain the intended indentation levels.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    record_comment_indent = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and ('#' in current_line or current_column < column):
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                record_comment_indent = False
            elif record_comment_indent:
                if char not in [' ', '\t']:
                    record_comment_indent = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                if '#' in current_line:
                    idx = current_line.index('#')
                    record_comment_indent = idx >= column

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Conclusion
- The corrected function now incorporates logic to correctly handle comments after dedent and maintain the appropriate indentation levels.
- The function should now pass the failing test mentioned in the error message and satisfy the expected input/output values.
- The bug related to comment indentation after dedent should be resolved based on the GitHub issue description.
