### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string up to a certain column, handling whitespace characters like spaces, tabs, and newlines. The issue arises when encountering comments that are supposed to be aligned with the current indentation level.

The error message shows an incorrect indentation for a comment line after a dedent operation. The function fails to maintain the correct column position for comments in certain cases, which leads to alignment issues.

### Error Cause:
The cause of the bug is the mishandling of tabs and spaces while calculating the current indentation level. When encountering a comment line following an indentation change, the function fails to adjust the column correctly, leading to incorrect alignment.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the transition between different levels of indentation when encountering whitespace characters or newlines. Specifically, we need to adjust the `current_column` value when processing comment lines to maintain the correct alignment.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            if current_column < column:
                wait_for_nl = True
            current_column += 1
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrections include:
- Adjusting the tab calculation to correctly increment `current_column`.
- Handling cases where `current_column` should be incremented based on the input prefix.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and handle the alignment issues described in the GitHub issue.
