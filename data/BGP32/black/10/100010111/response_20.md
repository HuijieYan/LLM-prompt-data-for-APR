### Analysis:
1. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to parse a prefix string character by character, keeping track of the indentation level of the prefix until a new line is encountered. The intention is to return the consumed lines up to a specified column and the remaining unparsed part of the string.
2. The bug likely lies in the logic related to handling tabs and whitespace characters, leading to incorrect behavior, especially with tabulated comments after a dedent.
3. The function does not correctly handle cases where tabs are used for indentation, causing inconsistencies in formatting for tabulated comments.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of tabs and spaces for indentation levels.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the logic for handling tabs and spaces in the input prefix.
2. Coordinate the handling of tabs to match the expected column values accurately.
3. Revise the conditions for checking and maintaining the correct indentation level.
4. Update the function to correctly manage tabulated comments after a dedent operation.

### Code Fix:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = ((current_column // 4) + 1) * 4  # Adjust for tab width
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The revised function includes adjustments to handle tabs correctly based on a tab width of 4 spaces and maintain the indentation levels consistently. This fix should address the formatting issue related to tabulated comments after a dedent operation as reported in the GitHub issue.
