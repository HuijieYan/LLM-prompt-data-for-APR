### Analysis:
1. The `partially_consume_prefix` function is supposed to handle the consumption of a prefix string up to a specified column number, while considering indentation levels and line breaks.
2. The error message indicates a failure in the indentation handling of comment lines, leading to an incorrect comparison result.
3. The function has issues with handling indentation and line breaks for comments in the prefix string, especially after dedents.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that comments are properly aligned with the expected column number after dedents and correctly handle indentation increases and decreases.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from incorrect handling of comments in relation to indentation levels and line breaks. When reaching a comment line after a dedent, the function fails to correctly align the comment with the expected column number.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure correct handling of comment lines after dedents.
2. Adjust comment line indentation based on the expected column number.
3. Update the logic of handling indentation levels for different characters.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By incorporating the correction to handle comments after dedents properly and adjusting the indentation, the function should now correctly align comments and handle them based on the column number.
