### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to the handling of indentation levels for comments in the input prefix. When a comment appears after an indent level, it should maintain the same level of indentation as the subsequent line of code. However, the function incorrectly changes the indentation for comments following a dedent.

The issue arises due to `wait_for_nl` being activated when encountering a non-space character, immediately expecting a newline character without correctly handling the indentation. This leads to incorrect handling of the current line and results in changing the comment's indentation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic for setting `wait_for_nl` to activate only when encountering a space or tab character, indicating the end of an indentation.
2. Adjust the way the current line is handled when `wait_for_nl` is active to include the correct indentation level for comments following a dedent.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if wait_for_nl:
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the logic as described above, the corrected function should correctly handle the indentation levels for comments following dedents, resolving the issue reported on GitHub and passing the failing test case.
