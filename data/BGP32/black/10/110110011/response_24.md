### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` in the `Driver` class is used to partially consume a prefix string until a certain column is reached while handling special cases for indentation. 
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` checks if comments are properly indented after dedent in a specific code snippet.
3. The error message indicates a mismatch in the expected and actual formatted strings for the test case involving tab indents and comments.
4. The GitHub issue describes a similar problem where the indentation for comments is incorrect after a dedent when using tabs in the input code.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` could be causing incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent operation, resulting in failing test cases and the reported GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Review the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function and ensure proper handling of different cases related to indentation.
2. Pay special attention to how tab and space characters are processed in the function.
3. Make sure that comments are correctly handled in relation to the dedent logic.
4. Update the function to address the specific issue of incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent operation when tabs are used.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Adjust for tab spacing
            elif char == '\n':
                # Handle newline and indentation for comments specifically
                if not current_line.strip():
                    lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # Handle cases where indent is not spaces or tabs
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the handling of tab characters and newline special cases, the corrected version of the function should address the bug related to incorrect comment indentation after a dedent operation when tabs are used in the input code.
