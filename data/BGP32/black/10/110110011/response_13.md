### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming a prefix string based on column requirements.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` specifically tests for comment indentation with different types of indentation (spaces and tabs).
3. The error message indicates a failure in formatting the contents which leads to an incorrect assertion.
4. The GitHub issue highlights a similar indentation problem related to comments after dedent using tabs.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of white spaces and tabs.
2. Incorrect updating of `wait_for_nl`.
3. Insufficient handling of indentation levels.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not correctly maintain the expected column count while handling white spaces, tabs, and new line characters, leading to incorrect prefix consumption.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Improve the logic to correctly track the column count.
2. Ensure that the function handles various forms of indentation properly (tabs and spaces).
3. Adjust the logic to consume the prefix string according to the specified column requirement.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char

        # Check if waiting for a new line
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # Indentation is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By correcting the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function as shown above, the function should now correctly consume the prefix string based on the column requirements. This should resolve the indentation issue observed in the failing test and address the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
