### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for incorrectly consuming the prefix in the input string.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` checks the behavior of comment indentation in different scenarios, where the input can have tabs or spaces.
3. The error message shows a specific assertion failure due to the incorrect behavior of the function.
4. The GitHub issue highlights a similar problem related to incorrect comment indentation after dedent.
5. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the indentation levels and newline characters.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `_partially_consume_prefix` function incorrectly consuming the prefix string without preserving the correct indentation level of comments. This results in misaligned comments after dedenting.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly identify and preserve the original indentation level of comments after dedenting. This can be achieved by adjusting the logic for tracking the current column and handling indentation characters.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # Reset current_column to correct for newline
                current_column = 0
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
            if char == '#':  # Adjust the column if a comment is encountered
                current_column = column
            
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, the issue related to incorrect comment indentation after dedent should be resolved.
