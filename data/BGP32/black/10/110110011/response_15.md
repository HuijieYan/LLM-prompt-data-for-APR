### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` in the `Driver` class is responsible for incorrect handling of indentation levels in the input prefix.
- The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is checking for correct behavior of comments indentation after dedent.
- The failing test is failing with an `AssertionError` due to incorrect comment indentation in the output.
- The GitHub issue highlights the problem of incorrect comment indentation after a dedent operation in code containing tabs.

### Potential Error Locations:
- Incorrect handling of indentation levels in the loop.
- Incorrect checking of conditions for the wait_for_nl variable.
- Improper return statement affecting the output.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug causes incorrect comment indentation after a dedent. This behavior is observed when the input prefix contains tabs.
- The issue stems from mishandling of indentation levels within the function, resulting in incorrect output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Ensure that the indentation levels and conditions are correctly maintained during prefix processing.
- Adjust the logic to properly handle dedent situations after indentations.
- Update the return statement to include the correct prefix and column.
- Test the updated function with the failing test case.

### Corrected Version:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                    continue
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # Reset current_column for the new line
                current_column = 0
                if not current_line.strip():
                    wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the logic for indentations, conditions, and handling of new lines, the corrected version should now properly process the prefix and return the expected output. This corrected function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue raised on GitHub.
