### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for handling the consumption of prefixes with specific indentations.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` expects correct handling of indentation for comments after a dedent in the input code.
3. The error message shows that the indentation for comments is not correctly handled after a dedent in the buggy function, leading to an assertion error in the failing test.
4. The GitHub issue provides context about the incorrect indentation behavior, specifically when using tabs in the input file.

### Error Location:
The bug is likely in the section where the `wait_for_nl` flag is being set and unset based on character conditions.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag. When a tab character is encountered, the current column is being added by 4, which doesn't align with the assertion test's expectation. This discrepancy in column increments leads to incorrect output and assertion failure.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the current column increment is consistent with the expected behavior after encountering tab characters. Additionally, the indent level should be correctly tracked to handle the comments' indentations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # Adjust for correct tab spacing
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the `current_column` calculation when encountering tab characters in the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we align it with the expected behavior to handle the indentation correctly. This change should resolve the indentation issue reported in the GitHub issue and ensure that the failing test passes successfully.
