### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function**: The `_partially_consume_prefix` function in the `Driver` class attempts to handle indentation levels before and after a comment in the given prefix.
   
2. **Bug Location**:
   - The bug is likely related to the handling of tabs and spaces for indentation levels before and after a comment in the prefix.
   - The condition where `wait_for_nl` is set to `True` is where the bug possibly lies.
   - The incorrect calculation of `current_column` might be causing the incorrect behavior.
   
3. **Cause of Bug**:
   - The bug is likely causing incorrect indentation after a dedent for tabulated comments.
   - The failing test specifically points out the issue with comment indentation.
   - The comparison in the failing test shows that the comment is not indented correctly after a dedent.
   - The error message points out the specific lines where the indentation mismatch occurs.
   
4. **Strategy for Fixing Bug**:
   - Ensure that the indentation logic for comments after a dedent is correctly implemented.
   - Properly handle the calculation of `current_column` and resetting it when necessary.
   
5. **Corrected Version**:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False

        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version simplifies the logic within the function to correctly handle the indentation, especially before and after comments, ensuring that the comment indentation is maintained after a dedent.
