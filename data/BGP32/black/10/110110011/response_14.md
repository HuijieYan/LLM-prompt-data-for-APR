### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is a method defined inside the `Driver` class. It is responsible for partially consuming a given prefix based on specific conditions.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` in the test file `tests/test_black.py` is trying to assert the formatting of code containing tab-based indentation and comment lines.
3. The error message indicates that the actual output from `fs(contents_tab)` does not match the expected output `contents_spc`.
4. The GitHub issue reports a specific scenario where the indentation for comments is incorrectly changed after a dedent, especially when tabs are used in the input.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to handling the indentation levels for comments and correctly identifying the column position when encountering tab characters. This results in incorrect processing of the prefix, leading to formatting discrepancies mentioned in the failing test and GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug, modifications are needed in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to ensure consistent handling of indentation levels, including tabs, spaces, and newline characters. Specifically, the logic for calculating the column positions and handling tab characters needs to be adjusted to align with the expected behavior.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Adjust for tabs by incrementing the column by a fixed width (4)
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip():  # Ensure processing only if line is not empty
                    lines.append(current_line)  # Collect processed line
                    current_line = ""  # Reset
                    current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False  # Reset flag
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By applying these corrections to the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, the bug related to incorrect indentation handling for comments after a dedent should be fixed. This corrected version addresses the issues mentioned in the failing test and the GitHub issue, ensuring consistent behavior across different types of code indentation.
