### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for handling the partial consumption of a prefix by checking for indentation and line breaks in the input prefix string.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is focused on checking the correct handling of indentation in comments after dedenting.
3. The error message indicates an assertion error due to incorrect handling of comments in the input string by the function.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the specific scenario where indentation for comments is changed incorrectly after dedenting when the input file uses tabs.

### Identified Error:
The cause of the bug is related to the logic inside the `_partially_consume_prefix` function that incorrectly processes the input prefix string containing tabs.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the logic for processing tabs in the input prefix string needs to be adjusted to handle comment indentation correctly after dedenting.

### Corrected Version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
        
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle tabs and comments after dedenting, the corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
