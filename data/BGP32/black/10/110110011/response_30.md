### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming the prefix text according to certain rules related to the column of text.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` compares the expected output with the actual output after using the function `fs` on different contents with different levels of indentation and comments.
3. The error message states that the indentation of the comment is not handled correctly after dedent operation.
4. The GitHub issue mentions that the library incorrectly changes the indentation for comments after a dedent operation when the input uses tabs.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of the indentation for comments after dedent operations when the input uses tabs. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` does not consider the scenario where a comment is separated by tabs and needs to maintain its original indentation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic that determines the indentation level of the comments while consuming the prefix text. This adjustment should ensure that comments are correctly indented relative to the existing code structure after dedent operations, especially when tabs are used.

### Corrected Version:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):].replace('\t', ' '*4)  # Replace tabs with spaces
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line.replace('\t', ' '*4)  # Replace tabs with spaces
```

By replacing tabs with spaces when returning the consumed prefix text, the function will maintain the correct indentation level for comments separated by tabs. This correction should resolve the indentation issue highlighted in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
