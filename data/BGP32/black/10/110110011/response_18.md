### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function:** The `_partially_consume_prefix` function in the `Driver` class is responsible for partially consuming a prefix based on specified column positions.
2. **Test Code:** The `test_comment_indentation` test function checks the correct behavior of commenting indentation in different scenarios.
3. **Error Message:** The failing test asserts that the formatted content using tabs does not match the expected content. The issue is related to incorrect comment indentation.
4. **GitHub Issue:** The GitHub issue describes the incorrect indentation behavior for tabulated comments after a dedent operation with the Black formatter.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of tabulated comments after a dedent operation. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function does not correctly track the column position when encountering comments, leading to erroneous indentation changes when reformatted by Black.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to properly handle tabulated comments while considering the indentation level.
2. Adjust the logic to account for comments when determining the correct column position.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        preceding_tabs = 0
        
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Adjust column position for tabulation
                preceding_tabs += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                preceding_tabs = 0  # Reset preceding tabs on newline
            else:
                # Check if there are preceding tabs
                if preceding_tabs > 0:
                    # Adjust column position based on preceding tabs
                    current_column += 4 * preceding_tabs 
                wait_for_nl = True
                
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function includes adjustments to handle tabulated comments correctly during the partial prefix consumption process. The added logic considers the number of preceding tabs to calculate the correct column position for comments.
