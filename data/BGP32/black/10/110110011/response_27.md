### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` in the `Driver` class incorrectly processes and consumes the prefix character by character. This leads to incorrect line indentation handling, especially when encountering tabs and spaces.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` specifically tests the behavior of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function for indentation with tabs and spaces.
3. The failing output presents an `AssertionError` due to the incorrect handling of indentation for comments following a dedent in the case of tabs.
4. The GitHub issue highlights an indentation problem that occurs after a dedent with tabulated code.
   
### Bug Cause:
The buggy function fails to correctly handle the consumption of prefix characters, causing issues with line indentation in the presence of tabs and spaces. This results in incorrect alignment of comments after a dedent operation, as observed in the failing test and mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function needs to be modified to accurately track line indentation and handle tabulation and spacing correctly. Proper handling of newline characters, tabs, spaces, and line breaks is essential to ensure correct prefix consumption and indentation alignment.
   
### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Adjust based on tab width
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
            res = ''.join(lines)
            return res, prefix[len(res):]
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the tab width increment in the case of encountering a tab character, the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function ensures proper line indentation handling. This modification should resolve the bug and allow the function to pass the failing test and address the GitHub issue related to incorrect indentation changes.
