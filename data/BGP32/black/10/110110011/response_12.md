### Analysis:
- **Buggy Function**:
    - The `_partially_consume_prefix` function in the `Driver` class is responsible for partially consuming the prefix of a string `prefix` based on a given `column`.
    - It breaks down the prefix into lines while considering indentation levels and waiting for new lines to continue.
- **Failing Test**:
    - The failing test `test_comment_indentation` in `tests/test_black.py` compares formatted strings with different levels of indentation and comments.
- **Error Message**:
    - The error message indicates an `AssertionError` where the expected and actual formatted strings are not matching due to incorrect indentation handling.
- **GitHub Issue**:
    - The GitHub issue reports incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent, specifically affecting comments after a dedent when using tabs.

### Identified Bug:
- **Cause**:
    - The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function causes incorrect handling of indentation when encountering comments after dedent when using tabs, as reported in the GitHub issue.
    - The issue arises from the incorrect logic in handling tabs and new lines while waiting for a new line before processing the next prefix.
- **Bug Fix Strategy**:
    - Adjust the logic for handling tabs and new lines to correctly maintain the expected indentation levels, especially after dedents.
    - Ensure that the function accounts for proper tab width and treats comments consistently within the same indentation level.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                        
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Adjust tab width to 4 spaces
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip():  # Skip unnecessary lines
                    lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
            
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
- The corrected version adjusts the tab width to 4 spaces for proper consistency with Python's default indentation.
- It also simplifies the newline processing by directly appending lines and resetting the current line and indentation when encountering a newline.
- These changes aim to address the specific issue related to incorrect indentation with tabulated comments after a dedent, as highlighted in the GitHub issue.
