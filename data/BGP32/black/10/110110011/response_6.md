### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` in the `Driver` class is responsible for partially consuming a prefix string while maintaining track of the columns and lines.
2. The failing test case `test_comment_indentation` checks the indentation of comments in the presence of tabs and spaces.
3. The error message indicates that the comment indentation is not being handled correctly when tabs are present in the input.
4. The GitHub issue highlights a specific scenario where comment indentation is incorrectly changing after a dedent when tabs are used.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is likely due to improper handling of tab characters in calculating the column position for indentation. When encountering a tab character, the function incorrectly increments the `current_column` variable by 4 instead of aligning it with the next tab stop in the input.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` needs to correctly handle tab characters for calculating columns. It should increment the `current_column` based on the next tab stop position. By adjusting the column calculation logic for tabs, the function can accurately track the indentation levels and resolve the comment indentation issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        tab_space = 4  # Define the number of spaces per tab
        
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                # Calculate the next tab stop position
                current_column += tab_space - (current_column % tab_space)
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the adjustment in calculating the column for tab characters, the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now properly handle the indentation, resolving the bug reported in the failing test and GitHub issue.
