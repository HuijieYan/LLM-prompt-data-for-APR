### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is used to consume a prefix of text based on certain indentation rules. The issue arises when dealing with tab characters and newline characters in the prefix. This function is being called by the Black code formatter, which is used to format Python code. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is focusing on ensuring that comments are correctly indented after dedentations, but due to the issue in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, the comments are not being handled properly.

The main problem in the buggy function is the handling of tab characters. The function increments the `current_column` by 4 for each tab character encountered, which is incorrect because a tab character should represent a single level of indentation. This incorrect handling causes the function to misinterpret the indentation level and leads to incorrect behavior when dealing with comments.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect increment of `current_column` for tab characters and the logic related to handling newlines and waiting for the next newline before processing the lines.

The failing test specifically highlights a scenario where comments are not being indented correctly after a dedent. The error message from the failing test shows that the expected and actual output do not match due to incorrect handling of indentation in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the increment value for tab characters should be changed from 4 to 1 to correctly represent a single level of indentation. Additionally, the logic related to newline characters should be adjusted to ensure that comments are correctly indented after a dedent.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 1  # Change from 4 to 1 for single level indentation
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By correcting the increment value for tab characters and adjusting the logic, the function should now correctly handle the indentation and address the issue raised in the failing test.
