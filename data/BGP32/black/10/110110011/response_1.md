### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is used to partially consume a given prefix string up to a certain column number. It processes each character in the prefix to determine the current line and column.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is trying to check if the prefix string is formatted correctly, specifically handling comments and indentation.
3. The error message shows that the expected and actual output do not match due to incorrect indentation for a comment line after a dedent.
4. The GitHub issue describes a similar problem where indentation for tabulated comments is changed incorrectly after a dedent.
5. The bug lies within the logic of handling indents, tabs, spaces, and newlines in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by a logic error in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function that fails to correctly handle the scenario where a comment should be aligned with the correct indentation level after a dedent. This leads to incorrect formatting when processing prefix strings that involve comments and indentation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the logic within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the indent levels and newline characters when encountering comments after a dedent. Ensuring that the correct indentation is maintained for comments at different levels of nesting is crucial to passing the failing test and addressing the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Function:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if wait_for_nl:
                    current_column = 0
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                if not current_line.isspace():
                    wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic to correctly handle indents, newlines, and comments, the corrected function above should pass the failing test and address the GitHub issue related to incorrect comment indentation in the prefix string processing.
