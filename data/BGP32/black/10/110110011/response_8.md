### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for incorrect handling of indentation in the code that uses tabulation for indentation.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is verifying proper formatting of code snippets with comments and indentations.
3. The corresponding error message indicates a misalignment between the expected and actual output due to incorrect handling of comments after dedent.
4. The GitHub issue describes a similar problem where the indentation for comments after a dedent is incorrectly changed.
5. The bug occurs when the function encounters tab characters in the code, leading to an incorrect indentation level for comments.

### Bug Description:
The bug occurs because the function fails to properly consider the tab characters (`\t`) while calculating the column levels. This causes an incorrect indentation level for comments after dedent, as observed in the failing test.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that tab characters are accounted for correctly when calculating column levels and handling the indentation of comments. We should adjust the logic in the function to handle tab characters as equivalent to multiple spaces based on the standard tab width.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Considering tab width as 4 spaces
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic to consider tab characters appropriately and adjusting the column levels accordingly, the corrected version of the function should now handle the indentation correctly for code with tab characters.
