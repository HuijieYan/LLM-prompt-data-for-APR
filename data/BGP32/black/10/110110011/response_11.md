### Analysis:
The `Driver` class contains a buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` that is causing indentation issues for tabulated comments after a dedent. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` in the `test_black.py` file highlights the incorrect behavior of the function with respect to handling tabulated comments.

The failing test compares the expected output with the actual output after formatting the given contents using the `fs` function. The error message shows that the actual output does not match the expected output.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when a tabulated comment is encountered after a dedent operation. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` incorrectly handles the indentation for such comments, leading to incorrect formatting of the input content.

The issue reported on GitHub further confirms the bug in the `black` library, detailing the specific scenario where the bug occurs.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that tabulated comments are correctly indented based on the current column position after a dedent operation. This can be achieved by adjusting the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to handle tabulated comments appropriately.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = ((current_column // 4) + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now handle tabulated comments correctly, resolving the bug identified in the failing test and the GitHub issue. This fix ensures that indentation is maintained properly for tabulated comments after a dedent operation.
