### Analysis:
- Buggy Function: `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming the prefix of the input text based on the provided column.
- Test Code: The failing test case `test_comment_indentation` checks if comments are properly formatted after dedent operations.
- Error Message: The error message shows that the actual formatted text does not match the expected text due to incorrect comment indentation.
- GitHub Issue: The reported issue highlights incorrect comment indentation after dedent operations when tabs are used in the input file.

### Bug Explanation:
- The bug occurs in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function while handling indentation for comments after a dedent operation.
- When a dedent operation is encountered after a comment with space indentation, the function fails to maintain the correct comment indentation.
- This leads to a misalignment between the comments and other code lines, causing the test to fail with an assertion error.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the logic inside the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle comment indentation after dedent operations.
- Ensure that comments are aligned with the correct column positions based on the existing code indentation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    indent_size = 4               # Define the size of an indent for consistent handling
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += indent_size
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            if char != '#':        # Skip processing comments for correct indentation
                wait_for_nl = True
                
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, the test `test_comment_indentation` should pass without any assertion errors. Ensure to test the fix against various scenarios to validate its correctness and robustness.
