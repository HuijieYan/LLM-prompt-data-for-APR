### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is within the `Driver` class in the file `blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py`.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is located in the file `tests/test_black.py`.
3. The failing test is checking for correct formatting of code with comments. The error message indicates a misalignment of comments after indentation changes.
4. The GitHub issue highlights a specific scenario where comments after dedent are incorrectly indented. The bug seems to be related to how comments are handled after indentation changes.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect handling of comments after indentation changes in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. When encountering comments in the input prefix, the function incorrectly handles their indentation, leading to misaligned comments in the output.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to properly handle the indentation of comments. Specifically, comments should align with the correct indentation level based on the surrounding code.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the adjustments in the corrected version above, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now handle the indentation of comments correctly, resolving the bug and allowing the specific test case to pass successfully.
