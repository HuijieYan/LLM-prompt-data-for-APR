### Analysis:
- **Buggy function**: `_partially_consume_prefix`
- **Bug Location**: The bug seems to be related to handling the indentation of comments in the given prefix string.
- **Error Cause**: The function is not correctly handling the indentation of comments after a dedent operation, leading to incorrect formatting.
- **GitHub Issue**: The issue description highlights that for codebase using tabs, the indentation for comments past depth 0 is changed incorrectly after a dedent operation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
The bug needs to be resolved by correctly handling the indentation levels and positions of comments in the prefix string.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 8 - (current_column % 8)  # Adjust column for tab
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Summary:
The corrected function includes the fix to adjust the column correctly in case of a tab (`\t`) character. The column is adjusted based on the remaining spaces to the next tab position. This adjustment ensures that the correct indentation is maintained for comments after a dedent operation. This fix should resolve the bug and make the function compatible with the test case provided.
