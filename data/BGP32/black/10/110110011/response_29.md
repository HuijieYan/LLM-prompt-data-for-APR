### Potential Error Locations:
1. The logic for handling different types of characters (spaces, tabs, new lines) may not be correctly updating the current_column value.
2. The condition for checking when to add a line to the list of lines may not be correctly evaluating.
3. The logic for handling the end of an indent block may not be properly triggering. 

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug causes incorrect indentation for comments after dedenting when using tabs in the input file. The failing test demonstrates the issue by showing a mismatch in expected and actual output due to incorrect handling of new lines and spaces/tabs processes.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to carefully evaluate the logic used for tracking the current column, checking for new lines, and correctly handling the end of an indent block. Additionally, we need to ensure that the function is preserving the original formatting when dealing with comments after dedenting.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# Updated corrected version of the function
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Check for preserving comment indentation
            if prefix[:current_column].strip().endswith('#') and current_column < column:
                # Adjust the indentation of the comment
                lines.append(current_line.lstrip())
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the logic within the function to specifically handle cases where comments are involved and ensuring proper column tracking, the corrected version should now preserve the original indentation for comments after a dedent when using tabs.
