### Analysis:
- **Buggy Function**: The `_partially_consume_prefix` function within the `Driver` class is responsible for partially consuming a given prefix of text while keeping track of line breaks and indentation markers.
- **Test Code**: The failing test `test_comment_indentation` in `tests/test_black.py` compares the expected and actual formatted content after applying the `fs` function.
- **Error Message**: The error message indicates a failure in the `assertFormatEqual` method due to incorrect comment indentation.
- **GitHub Issue**: The GitHub issue mentions that indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent, which aligns with the failing test.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs when the function encounters a tab (`'\t'`) character after dedentation. It fails to adjust the column count correctly, leading to incorrect comment indentation in the test case.
- The bug is reproducible for files using tabs instead of spaces for indentation, as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Adjust the logic related to tab characters (`'\t'`) within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly track the column count after dedentation.
- Ensure that the function handles tab characters consistently for proper indentation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Update to match tab indentation
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By modifying the `current_column += 4` line within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to account for tab indentation correctly, the bug should be resolved. This correction ensures consistent handling of tab characters for indentation, addressing the reported issue and passing the failing test.
