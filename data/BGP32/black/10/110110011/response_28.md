### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` within the `Driver` class in `driver.py` file is responsible for incorrect indentation handling while consuming a prefix text.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` in the `test_black.py` file highlights the issue with comments' indentation.
3. The GitHub issue describes the problem where comments indentation is changing incorrectly after a dedent.
4. The error message indicates that the expected and actual output are not matching due to incorrect comment indentation.
   
### Bug Explanation:
The bug is caused by the `_partially_consume_prefix` function incorrectly handling the indentation for comments when transitioning between lines with different indentation levels. This leads to the incorrect formatting of comments after a dedent, resulting in failed test cases.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly tracks and handles the indentation changes, especially in cases involving comments. By adjusting the logic for handling comments, we can ensure that the correct indentation is maintained during prefix consumption.

### Corrected Version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        previous_indent = ""
        
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = previous_indent
                    current_column = len(previous_indent)
                    previous_indent = ""
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
                previous_indent += char
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
                previous_indent += char
            elif char == '\n':
                previous_indent = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Changes Made:
1. Added `previous_indent` variable to store the correct indent from the previous line.
2. Update the logic to correctly handle comments' indentation by using `previous_indent` when necessary.
3. Ensure that the function maintains correct indentation levels while consuming the prefix text.

By incorporating these changes, the corrected function should now handle comments' indentation correctly and resolve the issue.
