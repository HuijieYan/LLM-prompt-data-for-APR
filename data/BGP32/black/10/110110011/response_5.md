## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for incorrectly changing the indentation of comments after a dedent. This leads to failing tests where the expected and actual output do not match.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is checking if the indentation of comments is correct after dedents, but due to the bug in the function, the test fails.
3. The corresponding error message indicates that the actual output is not matching the expected output because the comment indentation is incorrect after a dedent.
4. The GitHub issue describes a similar problem where indentation for comments after a dedent is changed incorrectly when using tabs. This aligns with the behavior observed in the failing test.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that comments maintain the correct indentation after dedents when using tabs.
6. The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of tab indentation in the function, leading to the incorrect placement of comments.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic of how tab indentation is handled within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly preserve comment indentation after dedents when using tabs.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
                current_line += char
            elif char == '\t':
                tabs = 4 - (current_column % 4)
                current_column += tabs
                current_line += ' ' * tabs
            elif char == '\n':
                if wait_for_nl:
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    current_line += char
                    current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                current_line += char
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line

``` 

By adjusting how tab indentation is handled and ensuring correct column calculations, this corrected version should address the bug and allow the function to correctly deal with comment indentation after dedents.
