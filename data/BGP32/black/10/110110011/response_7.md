### Analysis:
- **Buggy Function**: The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is intended to partially consume and process the given prefix string based on indentation rules.
- **Test Function**: The `test_comment_indentation` test is checking the behavior of comment indentation using the `fs` function.
- **Error Message**: The failing test asserts that the formatting output is not as expected, highlighting a mismatch in comment indentation.
- **GitHub Issue**: The GitHub issue reports a problem where indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent operation when using the Black library.
  
### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the `_partially_consume_prefix` function not handling the indentations of comments correctly, leading to incorrect behavior in cases where comments follow dedent operations. This causes incorrect comment indentation, as observed in the failing test and reported in the GitHub issue.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation of comments and ensure that comment lines are indented based on the corresponding code block's level.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        space_adjust = 0  # Track adjustment for space/tab indentation

        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column - space_adjust < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                space_adjust += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                space_adjust += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                space_adjust = 0  # Reset space adjustment for new line
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Justification:
The corrected version ensures that the `space_adjust` variable adjusts the indentation level correctly for spaces and tabs. This adjustment is crucial for maintaining the correct indentation alignment of comments with the code, resolving the bug that causes comment misalignment. After making these adjustments, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
