### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume the prefix up until a specified column value. The bug seems to be related to the indentation logic within the function. It fails to correctly handle spaces and tabs in the prefix, leading to differences in the expected and actual outputs.

- In case 1, the function fails to remove the comment (shown by the discrepancy in expected and actual outputs).
- In case 3, the function incorrectly handles tabs in the prefix, causing the discrepancy.
- In general, the function's handling of different indentation types (spaces, tabs) seems flawed, affecting its ability to correctly consume the prefix.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to improve how it handles indentation (spaces and tabs) in the prefix. Adjustments need to be made to correctly track column positions and remove unwanted indentation. This can be achieved by carefully following each character in the prefix and updating the line and column variables accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        
        for char in prefix:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                if current_column < column:
                    current_line += char
                else:
                    if current_line.strip():
                        lines.append(current_line + '\n')
                    current_line = char
                    current_column = 0
        
        if current_line.strip():
            lines.append(current_line + '\n')
        
        res = ''.join(lines)
        return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

By modifying the function to consider both spaces and tabs correctly for indentation tracking, the corrected version should now be able to properly consume the prefix up to the specified column limit, resolving the issues observed in the failing tests.
