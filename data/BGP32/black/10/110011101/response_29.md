### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` fails to correctly handle the scenario when encountering a new line character after waiting for a newline. The function incorrectly updates the column count without considering the existing indentation level. This issue leads to incorrect indentation when joining the lines back.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the column count takes into account the correct indentation level. This can be achieved by updating the column count correctly when encountering a new line character after waiting for a newline.

### Corrected Code
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                # Handle tab indentation correctly
                current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
            elif char == '\n':
                # Handle new line indentation correctly
                current_column = 0
            
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
