### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the incorrect handling of the indentation level in the input `prefix`. The function does not correctly adjust the `column` value when encountering new lines or variations in indentation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `current_column` variable accurately represents the current indentation level, taking into account spaces, tabs, and new lines. Additionally, the function should correctly handle leading spaces or tabs in the `prefix` string.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res.strip(), prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines).strip(), current_line
```

By ensuring that the `current_column` variable accurately tracks the indentation level by adjusting for both spaces and tabs, the function should now correctly consume the prefix up to the specified column index.
