### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises when the comment starts after an indentation and does not have any characters before it. This situation causes the function to not account for the indentation level in the comment.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when a comment starts after an indentation level, the function correctly keeps track of the column based on the existing indentation.

### Corrected Code:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                if char.strip():  # Account for extra indentation spaces in comments
                    wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adding the condition `if char.strip():` before setting `wait_for_nl = True`, we ensure that the function correctly handles comments that start after an indentation level. This modification should fix the bug and align the function with the expected behavior, passing the failing test cases.
