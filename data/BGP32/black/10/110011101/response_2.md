### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the incorrect handling of column counting when encountering whitespace characters, especially tabs. The function fails to correctly update the `current_column` value for tab characters leading to incorrect alignment tracking.

In Case 3, for example, when encountering the tab character '\t', the function incorrectly increments `current_column` by 4 instead of our expected behavior of updating it by 1. This inconsistency results in the function incorrectly calculating the indentation level when compared with the expected output.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the tab character increments the `current_column` by 1 as we would expect for a single indentation level. This adjustment should align the tracking of indentation correctly and resolve the failing tests.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 1  # Corrected the tab handling to increment by 1
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By making this adjustment to increment the `current_column` by 1 for tab characters, the function should now correctly track indentation levels and pass the failing tests.
