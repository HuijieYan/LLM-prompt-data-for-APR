### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is due to the incorrect handling of the indentation level that is supposed to be consumed from the input prefix. When encountering a newline character (`\n`), the logic to reset the `current_column` and move to the next line is flawed, leading to inconsistencies in the indentation level.

### Bug Explanation:
In the failing test cases, the function is not correctly consuming the indentation before the comment in some scenarios. This results in an incorrect output where the consumed prefix does not match the expected output. The logic to handle the indentation level and newline characters is flawed, causing the bug.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly consumes the indentation before deciding where a new line starts. Proper handling of tab characters, spaces, and newline characters is crucial for consistent behavior. We need to revise the logic related to handling indentation levels and newline characters to align with the expected behavior.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip():  # Check if line is not empty before moving to the next line
                lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            current_line += char
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying these corrections to the function, the test cases should now pass as the function will correctly consume the indentation level before the comment in the input prefix.
