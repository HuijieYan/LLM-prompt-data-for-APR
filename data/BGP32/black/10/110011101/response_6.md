### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to the way the function handles spacing and indentation. The function incorrectly calculates the column count when encountering tab characters (`\t`), leading to incorrect indentation handling.

The issue arises when the function encounters a tab character (`\t`). It incorrectly increments `current_column` by 4, assuming each tab represents 4 spaces. However, this assumption is incorrect, as tabs should be counted as a single character.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to accurately handle tab characters when calculating the current column position. Tabs are equivalent to a single character, not 4 spaces. By adjusting the increment for tabs to 1, the function should correctly handle indentation.

### Updated and Corrected Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Handle tabs accurately
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the increment for tabs to 1 when calculating the current column position, the corrected function should now handle indentation correctly and pass the failing test cases.
