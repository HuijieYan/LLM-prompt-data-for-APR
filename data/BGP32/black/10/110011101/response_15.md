### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string up to a certain column limit based on different whitespace characters. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles newlines and calculates the current column position. It fails to maintain the correct column position when encountering newlines or whitespace characters.

### Bug Explanation
Looking at the runtime values in the failing test cases, we can see that the function fails to correctly handle newlines. It does not reset the `current_column` to 0 when encountering a newline character, leading to incorrect column calculations. This results in incorrect output where comments don't align properly with the expected output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when the function encounters a newline character (`'\n'`), the `current_column` is updated to 0 to restart column counting for the next line. Additionally, we should reset the `current_line` when a newline is encountered and trim any extra whitespace at the end of the line before adding it to the `lines` list.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False

        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\n':
                current_column = 0  # Reset column count on newline
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line.strip())  # Trim extra whitespace before adding line to lines
                current_line = ""
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif wait_for_nl:
                current_line += char
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
                current_line += char

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected function ensures that the column count is correctly handled on newlines and trims extra whitespace. It should now produce the expected output alignment for comments as specified in the failing test cases.
