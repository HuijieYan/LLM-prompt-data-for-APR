### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs when the function `_partially_consume_prefix` fails to correctly handle the line endings (\n) and indentation levels, resulting in incorrect prefix consumption and line continuation. This leads to a mismatch between the expected and actual output, causing the failing test cases.

1. The function fails to properly update the `current_column` when encountering newlines `\n`.
2. The logic for tracking indentation and handling wait conditions (`wait_for_nl`) is flawed.
3. Inconsistent handling of different indentation characters such as spaces and tabs.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, we need to ensure that:
1. The `current_column` is correctly updated for each character processed.
2. The logic for detecting line endings and handling indentation levels is accurate.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column + 4) // 8 * 8  # Adjust for tab width
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By correcting the logic related to tab width adjustment and line ending handling, the function should now consume the prefix correctly to match the expected output, passing the failing test cases.
