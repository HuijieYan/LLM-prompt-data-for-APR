### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to process a given prefix string until a specific column is reached, separating lines appropriately. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the case when a new line character is encountered.

#### Observations:
1. The `wait_for_nl` flag is supposed to signify that the function is waiting for a new line character to end the current line. However, this logic seems to cause issues when handling the indentation level exactly at the specified column.
2. The function seems to miss updating the current line list when encountering a new line character, leading to incorrect line separation.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the premature flushing of the current line before adding it to the lines list. When `wait_for_nl` is set, a new line character should trigger line separation, but the current line content is not saved correctly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the logic to correctly handle the case when a new line character is encountered.
2. Make sure to add the current line to the lines list after line separation.
3. Check if the current line should be appended after handling the new line character.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version now correctly handles line separation when encountering a new line character, ensuring the current line is stored appropriately before moving to the next line.
