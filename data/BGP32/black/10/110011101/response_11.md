### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string until a certain column count is reached, preserving newlines and indentations.
- The bug appears to be in handling the case when the indentation ends abruptly due to a newline or the prefix reaching its end. This causes incorrect formatting.
- The function should correctly handle newlines, spaces, and tabs while counting columns.
- The function fails to properly maintain the newlines and columns when formatting comments, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug arises when the function encounters a newline character and does not correctly reset the column count.
- This leads to incorrect formatting where comments are not aligned properly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that whenever the function encounters a newline, the column count is correctly reset to 0.
- Additionally, the function should handle cases where the current line is empty or whitespace after the newline, ensuring that the output maintains correct formatting.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    current_column = 0  # Reset column count if a newline is not followed by whitespace
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By reseting the column count when encountering a newline and properly handling cases where a newline is not followed by whitespace, this corrected version should now maintain the correct column formatting and pass the failing tests.
