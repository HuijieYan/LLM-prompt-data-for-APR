### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle cases where the `column` parameter is greater than the actual indentation level in the `prefix`. Specifically, when `wait_for_nl` is set to True, the function checks if the current character is a newline character to determine if the current line's indentation level meets the specified column. However, in cases where the line ends without a newline character, the function fails to correctly update the `current_column` variable, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `current_column` variable is correctly updated in all scenarios, even when a newline character is not encountered. This can be achieved by updating the `current_column` variable when processing characters other than whitespace or newline.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                current_column += 1
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By updating `current_column` for all character types instead of just whitespace or newline characters, the corrected function should now handle all cases correctly and pass the failing test cases.
