### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to how it handles indentation levels when encountering comments in the prefix string. The function fails to correctly handle the case where a comment is preceded by indentation spaces or tabs. It mistakenly counts these spaces or tabs as "empty lines" and does not properly adjust the current column position.

This leads to incorrect behavior where the function doesn't consume the full prefix, resulting in incorrect output when the consumed prefix is compared to the expected prefix. The function fails to handle comment lines and their indentation levels correctly, leading to the assertion error in the failing test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to properly handle the indentation levels when comments are encountered. Comments should not be considered as part of the indentation and should not affect the column position. We need to ensure that the function correctly consumes all relevant parts of the prefix while maintaining proper indentation levels.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0

    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char

    res = ''.join(lines)
    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making these adjustments to the function, we ensure that comments do not interfere with the indentation tracking, allowing the function to correctly consume the prefix string. The corrected version should pass the failing test cases as it handles comments and indentation levels properly.
