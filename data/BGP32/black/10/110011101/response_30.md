### Bug Explanation
The bug is caused by the condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` inside the function `_partially_consume_prefix()`. The code is trying to check if the current_line has content and if the current_column is less than the specified column length before appending the line to `lines`. However, the condition should look at the length of the current_line after stripping whitespaces instead of the original length.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the condition to check the length of the stripped `current_line` to ensure accurate processing of lines based on the desired indentation level.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and len(current_line.strip()) <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By correcting the condition to check the length of the stripped `current_line`, the function should now correctly handle the indentation and line processing issues.
