### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the condition where it checks for an empty line (`char == '\n'`) but does not handle the case where this empty line might have leading spaces or tabs. This condition causes the function to incorrectly reset the `current_column` to 0, leading to incorrect indentation handling.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the handling of the `'\n'` character to also consider cases where there might be leading spaces or tabs before the newline character. By adjusting the logic in this condition, we can ensure that the function correctly maintains the current indentation level.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    indent = len(current_line) - len(current_line.lstrip())
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = indent
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # handle indentation with leading spaces or tabs
                indent = len(current_line) - len(current_line.lstrip())
                current_column = indent
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should now properly handle indentation with leading spaces or tabs before newline characters, thereby resolving the bug and passing the failing tests.
