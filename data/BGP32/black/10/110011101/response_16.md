### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has an issue where it fails to properly handle the indentation checking when encountering a newline character. This leads to incorrect behavior in determining the `current_line` and `current_column` values, affecting the overall correctness of the function.

When a newline character is encountered, the function should reset the `current_column` to `0` since it starts a new line. However, the current implementation does not reset the `current_column` when a newline is found, leading to incorrect calculations of the indentation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when a newline character is encountered, the `current_column` is correctly reset to `0`. This adjustment will correctly handle the indentation logic and ensure that the prefix is consumed accurately.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset the current_column to 0 when encountering a newline
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures that when a newline character is encountered, the `current_column` is reset to `0` as expected. This adjustment should resolve the bug and make the function correctly consume the prefix with the specified column indentation.
