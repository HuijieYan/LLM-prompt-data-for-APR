### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is causing the function to incorrectly handle the indentation when encountering a comment. This results in certain characters being consumed when they should not be, leading to incorrect formatting.

In the failing test case, the function fails to correctly handle the indentation before the comment. Specifically, the function consumes the spaces before the comment when it should not. This leads to the misalignment of the comment in the formatted output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation and alignment of the comment. Specifically, the function should only consume characters if they are within the specified column range. Additionally, we need to ensure that the function maintains the correct indentation level for the comment.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                if current_column < column:  # Only increment column when within limit
                    current_column += 1
                else:
                    current_line += char  # Add characters to current line after column limit
            elif char == '\t':
                if current_column + 4 <= column:  # Only increment column when within limit
                    current_column += 4
                else:
                    current_line += char  # Add characters to current line after column limit
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By modifying the conditionals for handling spaces and tabs, the corrected version ensures that characters are only consumed when they are within the specified column limits. This adjustment should fix the bug and correctly handle the indentation and alignment of comments.
