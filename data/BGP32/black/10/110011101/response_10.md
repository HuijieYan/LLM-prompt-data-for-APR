### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume part of a prefix string based on indentation level. However, there is a bug in the logic that results in incorrect behavior. The specific issue arises when a comment line starts at the same column level as the expected column but with spaces before it.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle spaces before comments properly. When it encounters a space before a comment, it increments the `current_column` counter but does not reset it when it encounters `\n`. This causes the function to fail to recognize the correct level of indentation for comments preceded by spaces.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the function to properly handle spaces before comments. Specifically, we should reset the `current_column` counter when encountering a newline `\n` after encountering spaces.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False  # Reset wait_for_nl if encountering \n
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should now correctly handle comments preceded by spaces and produce the expected output across all test cases.
