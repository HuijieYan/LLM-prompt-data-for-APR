### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs when processing a newline character (`\n`) after encountering spaces or tabs. The current implementation incorrectly handles the case where the prefix string ends in a newline character. 
The issue is that when `wait_for_nl` is `True`, and a newline character is encountered, the program does not append the current line to `lines`. This leads to the missing line that should be included in the resulting lines. 

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when the function is in the `wait_for_nl` state and encounters a newline character, the current line is added to `lines` before resetting the variables for the next line.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip():
                lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By including the handling of the newline character in the `wait_for_nl` if block, the corrected function ensures that lines are correctly added to the `lines` list when necessary. This updated version should pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output.
