### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the provided function `_partially_consume_prefix` stems from the incorrect handling of the tab character and calculating the column position. When the function encounters a tab character (`\t`), it should increment the `current_column` variable by 8 instead of 4, which is the standard tab width. This leads to incorrect column calculation, especially when tabs are present in the input prefix.

### Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the function to correctly handle tab characters and update the `current_column` variable accordingly. Specifically, we should increase the `current_column` by 8 when encountering a tab character. 

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 8  # Adjusted for tab width
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making these changes, the function should now properly handle the tab character and calculate the column position accurately, fixing the bug identified in the failing test cases.
