### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs when the code encounters a newline character (`\n`) while processing the input `prefix`. If the code encounters a newline while the `wait_for_nl` flag is set to `True`, indicating that an indent section is finished and it's looking for a newline, it should reset `current_column` to 0 and reset `current_line` to empty. However, the current implementation does not reset `current_line` when encountering a newline character, leading to incorrect line formation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the code should reset `current_line` to an empty string when encountering a newline character while waiting for a newline. This adjustment will ensure that the lines are properly formed with the correct indentation level.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_line = ""  # Reset current_line when encountering '\n'
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

This corrected version of the function includes the fix by resetting `current_line` to an empty string when encountering a newline character. This change ensures that the lines are formatted correctly with the appropriate indentation levels.
