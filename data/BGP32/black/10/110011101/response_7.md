### Bug Explanation
The bug arises from how the function handles the case when encountering a '\n' character. When an '\n' is found, the current_column is immediately set to 0, causing incorrect indentation tracking. This results in the error seen in the failing test where comment indentation is not preserved correctly after a '\n'.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the current_column is correctly updated when encountering an '\n' character. This involves handling the behavior differently when a newline is encountered to maintain proper indentation tracking.

### Corrected Function
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By adjusting the handling of the '\n' character, the corrected function should now track the indentation properly and pass the failing test.
