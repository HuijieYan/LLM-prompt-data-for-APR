### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume part of a prefix string based on a given column position. The bug seems to be related to the handling of indentation levels and newline characters. The function fails to correctly align the consumed prefix with the specified column position, resulting in incorrect output.

### Bug Explanation
1. In Case 1, the function fails to correctly adjust the indentation level of the consumed prefix when encountering a newline character. The current logic does not account for the additional spaces before the comment in the given prefix.
2. In Case 3 and Case 5, the function incorrectly handles tabs as they are not counted towards the current column position. This leads to incorrect indentation alignment when consuming the prefix.
3. In Case 2 and Case 4, the function fails to handle empty prefixes correctly, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Adjust the calculation of the `current_column` when encountering tabs to consider the equivalent number of spaces.
2. Ensure that the function correctly handles indentation levels, especially when consuming prefixes that include different types of whitespace characters.
3. Improve the logic to handle empty prefixes gracefully.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Assume each tab is 4 spaces
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line += char
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly consume prefixes based on the specified column position.
