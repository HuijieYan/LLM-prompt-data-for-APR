### Bug Explanation

The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume part of a prefix string based on a given column value. However, the bug lies in the condition where a new line character is encountered. The function is incorrectly resetting the `current_column` to 0 when a new line is encountered. This behavior disrupts the expected behavior of maintaining the correct column count.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the column count `current_column` is properly updated when encountering a new line character. We should only reset `current_column` to 0 when the indentation is finished (`wait_for_nl` is True).

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py

# The declaration of the class containing the fixed function
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    current_column += 1
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # Do not reset current_column here
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the proposed changes, the function should now correctly maintain and update the column count when encountering new line characters, resolving the bug and passing the failing test cases.
