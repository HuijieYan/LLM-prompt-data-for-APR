### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string until a certain column limit is reached, while preserving newline characters. However, the function fails to correctly handle newline characters and indentation levels, leading to incorrect results.

#### Issues:
1. The function fails to correctly handle the case where a newline character is encountered before reaching the specified column limit.
2. The function does not properly handle the calculation of the current column when encountering different types of characters.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when the function encounters a newline character ('\n') while waiting for a newline after an indent. When a newline character is found, the function incorrectly resets the current column to 0, leading to the incorrect calculation of the remaining prefix.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the logic to correctly handle newline characters and indentation levels.
2. Update the current column calculation based on the specific characters encountered.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line = char + current_line
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
        else:
            current_line += char
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                wait_for_nl = True
    
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, current_line
```

By making these adjustments to the function, it should now correctly consume the prefix string while preserving newline characters and maintaining the correct indentation levels.
