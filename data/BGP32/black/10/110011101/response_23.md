### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is supposed to partially consume a prefix string based on a specified column value. The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of the indentation level and the logic related to waiting for a new line character while consuming the prefix.

### Issues:
1. The `wait_for_nl` condition is not properly resetting after consuming a new line character, causing incorrect behavior.
2. The logic to properly maintain the current indentation level is flawed, leading to errors in processing the input prefix.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Reset the `wait_for_nl` flag after consuming a new line character to correctly identify the start of a new indent.
2. Update the logic for handling indentation characters like spaces and tabs to maintain the correct column value.

### Updated Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            wait_for_nl = True
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By fixing the logic related to indent tracking and resetting the `wait_for_nl` condition properly, the updated function should now correctly handle the partially consuming of the input prefix string.
