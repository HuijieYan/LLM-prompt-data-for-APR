### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` aims to partially consume a prefix based on a specified column value. The bug seems to occur when trying to skip the indentation and find the next new line when the column does not match.

1. The function initializes variables like `lines`, `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl`.
2. It iterates over each character in the `prefix`.
3. It appends characters to `current_line` until it reaches a newline character.
4. When reaching a newline character, it checks if it needs to wait for the next newline, looks for indentation errors, and handles cases where the column condition is not met.
5. Finally, it returns the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix based on the column condition.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function `wait_for_nl` is set to `True` prematurely when encountering spaces or tabs, expecting a new line shortly after. This leads to incorrect handling of the indentation check, especially when a newline character is not encountered immediately.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of setting `wait_for_nl` and how the newline characters are handled. Specifically, we need to ensure that `wait_for_nl` is only set when an indent is complete and a new line is expected.

### Corrected Code:
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying this correction, the function should handle the indentation and new line checks correctly, resolving the bug and passing the failing test cases.
