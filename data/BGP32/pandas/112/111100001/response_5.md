### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `get_indexer` within the `IntervalIndex` class in the file `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py`.
2. The function checks for overlapping indices and then performs various operations based on the type of `target` input.
3. The bug likely lies in the logic related to checking for overlapping indices and generating the indexer based on the type of `target`.
4. The failing test case `test_round_interval_category_columns` provides an input of an IntervalIndex as columns for a DataFrame and expects the DataFrame values to be rounded, leading to a comparison failure.
5. To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the overlapping indices case and ensure that the indexer is generated correctly for the given `target`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is in the conditional check `if self.is_overlapping:` which is missing parentheses to actually call the method `is_overlapping`. This results in the condition always being considered True, leading to an InvalidIndexError being raised for cases that do not actually have overlapping indices.

### Fix:
I will fix the bug by correcting the condition `if self.is_overlapping:` to `if self.is_overlapping():` to properly call the method `is_overlapping`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # rest of the code remains the same
``` 

After making this correction, the function should now handle the overlapping indices properly and pass the failing test case.
