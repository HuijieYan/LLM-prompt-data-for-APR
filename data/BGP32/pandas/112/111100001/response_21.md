### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_indexer` is defined within the `IntervalIndex` class in the `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py` file.
2. The function takes several arguments (`target`, `method`, `limit`, `tolerance`) and returns a NumPy array.
3. The function first checks the method argument using the `_check_method` function and then performs several conditional checks and calculations based on the type of `target` passed to it.
4. The bug seems to be related to the check for overlapping indices and the calculation of `indexer` within the function.
5. The failing test `test_round_interval_category_columns` tries to round the values in a DataFrame with columns as `CategoricalIndex` created using `pd.interval_range` and expects specific rounded values.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `get_indexer` function relates to the condition check for overlapping indices. The condition `if self.is_overlapping` should actually call the method `is_overlapping()` using `self.is_overlapping()` to correctly check for overlapping indices. As a result, the function incorrectly raises an `InvalidIndexError` even if the indices are not overlapping.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to change the condition from `if self.is_overlapping:` to `if self.is_overlapping():` to correctly check for overlapping indices.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # rest of the code remains unchanged
```

After making this change, the corrected function should now correctly check for overlapping indices and pass the failing test.
