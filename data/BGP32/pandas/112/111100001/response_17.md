### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class is failing due to an issue with identifying overlapping indices and handling non-overlapping indices correctly.

### Identified potential errors:
1. The function is not correctly handling overlapping indices.
2. In the case of non-overlapping indices being provided, the function is not matching left and right indices correctly.
3. There is a need to check for common subtype compatibility and closed status before proceeding with the indexing.
4. The function is not correctly handling non-overlapping heterogeneous scalar indices.

### Cause of the bug:
The buggy function is failing to handle overlapping indices correctly, leading to an error being raised. Additionally, the logic for matching left and right indices in the case of non-overlapping indices is flawed, causing incorrect indexing behavior and erroneous results.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure proper handling of overlapping indices.
2. Check for and handle non-overlapping indices correctly by matching left and right indices.
3. Verify common subtype compatibility and closed status before proceeding with indexing.
4. Enhance the handling of non-overlapping heterogeneous scalar indices for accurate indexing.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        raise NotImplementedError("Overlapping indices not yet implemented.")

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

        common_subtype = find_common_type(
            [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
        )
        if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

        left_indexer = self.left().get_indexer(target_as_index.left())
        right_indexer = self.right().get_indexer(target_as_index.right())
        indexer = np.where(np.logical_and(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer != -1), left_indexer, -1)
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        indexer = [self.get_loc(key) if key in self else -1 for key in target_as_index]

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

This corrected version of the `get_indexer` function addresses the issues related to handling overlapping and non-overlapping indices correctly, improving the accuracy of indexing operations within the `IntervalIndex` class.
