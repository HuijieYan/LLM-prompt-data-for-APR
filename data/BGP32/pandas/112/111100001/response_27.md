### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `get_indexer()` within the `IntervalIndex` class.
2. The buggy function is trying to handle overlapping indices and find the corresponding indexer values in the target index. 
3. The bug in the function is related to checking for overlapping indices and the logic to determine the correct indexer values.
4. The bug causing the failure in the test is due to overlapping indices not being correctly handled.
5. To fix the bug, adjustments need to be made in the logic to handle overlapping indices correctly.

### Bug Fix:
```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
        self._check_method(method)
        
        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
        
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
        
        # Rest of the function remains the same
```

### Explanation:
- The bug fix involves calling the `is_overlapping` function correctly with `self.is_overlapping()` to determine overlapping indices.
- With this fix, the function will correctly raise an error in case of overlapping indices, ensuring the correct behavior.

By applying this fix, the `get_indexer()` function in the `IntervalIndex` class should now handle overlapping indices correctly and pass the failing test.
