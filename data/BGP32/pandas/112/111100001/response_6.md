### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class is attempting to handle overlapping indices but is encountering an issue with checking if the indices are overlapping. The buggy function checks if `self.is_overlapping` is `True` to determine if the indices are overlapping, but it fails to call the `is_overlapping` method correctly.

### Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the buggy function is the way the `is_overlapping` method is checked. It should be invoked as a method, i.e., `self.is_overlapping()`, but it is just accessed as an attribute `self.is_overlapping`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by attempting to access the `is_overlapping` method as an attribute, which fails and does not properly determine if the indices are overlapping. This results in an incorrect control flow leading to the wrong behavior in the function for handling overlapping indices.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the `is_overlapping` method should be called correctly as `self.is_overlapping()`. This will correctly evaluate if the indices are overlapping and enable the function to handle overlapping indices as intended.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
            if self.equals(target_as_index):
                return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
    
            # different closed or incompatible subtype -> no matches
            common_subtype = find_common_type(
                [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
            )
            if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
                return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    
            # non-overlapping -> at most one match per interval in target_as_index
            # want exact matches -> need both left/right to match, so defer to
            # left/right get_indexer, compare elementwise, equality -> match
            left_indexer = self.left().get_indexer(target_as_index.left())
            right_indexer = self.right().get_indexer(target_as_index.right())
            indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
        else:
            # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
            # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
            indexer = []
            for key in target_as_index:
                try:
                    loc = self.get_loc(key)
                except KeyError:
                    loc = -1
                indexer.append(loc)
    
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

By making the suggested correction in the `get_indexer` function, the bug related to handling overlapping indices should be resolved, and the corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
