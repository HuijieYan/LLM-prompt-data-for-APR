### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is named `get_indexer` and it belongs to the `IntervalIndex` class.
2. The buggy function checks if the `self.is_overlapping` attribute is true and raises a `InvalidIndexError` if so.
3. The failing test `test_round_interval_category_columns` creates a DataFrame with columns as a `CategoricalIndex` of intervals, then rounds the DataFrame values. The expected result after rounding is compared against the actual result using `assert_frame_equal`.
4. The bug seems to be related to the logic that handles the case when `self.is_overlapping` is True and as a result, it raises an error even in cases where it should not.
5. The strategy to fix the bug would involve properly handling the case when `self.is_overlapping` is True and making sure that the error is only raised in the relevant situations.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function to fix the bug:

```python
    @Substitution(
        **dict(
            _index_doc_kwargs,
            **{
                "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                    """
        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError
            If any method argument other than the default of
            None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
        """
                )
            },
        )
    )
    @Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = "cannot handle overlapping indices; use IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            raise NotImplementedError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # The rest of the logic remains the same...
```

In the corrected code, the key change is in the condition `if self.is_overlapping():` to properly call the `is_overlapping` method with parentheses to get the correct boolean value. Additionally, I changed the error to raise `NotImplementedError` instead of `InvalidIndexError` based on the given issue context. The remaining logic of the function remains unchanged as it is pertinent to the functionality.
