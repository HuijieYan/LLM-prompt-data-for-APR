## Analysis:
The buggy function `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class is supposed to return the index of the target array within the IntervalIndex object. The bug seems to be related to the comparison logic when handling overlapping indices.

## Bug:
The bug occurs when checking for overlapping indices in the `get_indexer` function. The condition `if self.is_overlapping:` does not actually call the method `is_overlapping()` to determine if the indices are overlapping. Instead, it treats `self.is_overlapping` as a boolean attribute and always executes the block of code that raises an `InvalidIndexError`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Ensure to actually call the `is_overlapping()` method to check if the indices are overlapping.
- Modify the logic to handle overlapping indices correctly.
- Update the return statements as needed to handle different scenarios based on the results of the comparisons.
- Verify that the corrected function passes the failing test case.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping():
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
            if self.equals(target_as_index):
                return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
    
            # different closed or incompatible subtype -> no matches
            common_subtype = find_common_type(
                [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
            )
            if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
                return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    
            # non-overlapping -> at most one match per interval in target_as_index
            # want exact matches -> need both left/right to match, so defer to
            # left/right get_indexer, compare elementwise, equality -> match
            left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
            right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
            indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
        else:
            # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
            # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
            indexer = []
            for key in target_as_index:
                try:
                    loc = self.get_loc(key)
                except KeyError:
                    loc = -1
                indexer.append(loc)
    
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

After making the above correction, re-run the failing test case provided to ensure that the bug has been fixed.
