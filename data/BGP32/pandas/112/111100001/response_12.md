### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class seems to have an issue where it is not correctly handling the `is_overlapping` condition. This condition should be called as a method `is_overlapping()` to check if the Index is overlapping or not.

### Identified Issue:
The issue lies in the `if self.is_overlapping:` check where `is_overlapping` is being checked without calling it as a method. This might lead to unintended behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by directly checking `self.is_overlapping` instead of calling the method `is_overlapping()` to check if the Index is overlapping. This can lead to incorrect comparisons and raise errors even in cases where the indexes are not overlapping.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should modify the problematic line to call the method `is_overlapping()`. This will correctly check if the Index is overlapping and prevent any unintended errors.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

By making this change, we ensure that the `is_overlapping()` method is correctly called to check for overlapping indices, fixing the bug in the function.
