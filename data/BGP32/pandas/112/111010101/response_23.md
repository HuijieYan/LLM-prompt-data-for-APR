### Analysis
The buggy function `get_indexer` is defined twice in the `IntervalIndex` class, causing a conflict. The function is declared with different arguments in each definition, leading to a type error during execution.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by defining the `get_indexer` function twice with different arguments:
```python
def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:
```
and
```python
def get_indexer(self, scalar_t[:] target):
```
The function call in the failing test expects the first definition with multiple arguments but encounters the second definition with a different signature, leading to a type error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove or correct one of the `get_indexer` function definitions based on the expected usage. Since the failing test depends on the first definition, we should correct the second definition to match the first one.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:
```python
# Remove the second definition of get_indexer function
def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:
    
    self._check_method(method)
    
    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = "cannot handle overlapping indices; use IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # remaining implementation...
```

By correcting the second definition of the `get_indexer` function to match the first one, the bug causing the type error in the failing test should be fixed.
