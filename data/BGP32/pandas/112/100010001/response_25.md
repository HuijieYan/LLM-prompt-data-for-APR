### Explanation:
The error message `TypeError: No matching signature found` indicates that there is a type mismatch issue when calling the `get_indexer` method. The method signature in the buggy function is incorrect, leading to this TypeError.

In the buggy function:
```python
def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike):
```
The `target` parameter is annotated as `AnyArrayLike`, but in the error message, it provides a more specific type hint `scalar_t[:]`. This difference in type hints causes the TypeError.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the type hint for the `target` parameter in the `get_indexer` method needs to be updated to match the expected type in the test case, which is `scalar_t[:]`. By using the correct type hint, we ensure that the method signature matches the expected input.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def get_indexer(self, target: scalar_t[:]):
```

After making this change, the corrected version of the function should match the expected type and pass the failing test.
