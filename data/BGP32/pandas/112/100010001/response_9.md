### Analysis:
The error message indicates a `TypeError: No matching signature found` when the `get_indexer` method is called with the argument `target_as_index.values`. This error implies that there is an issue with the signature or definition of the `get_indexer` method in the buggy function.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The `get_indexer` method itself where the error occurs.
2. The definition of the `get_indexer` method signature.
3. The type conversion or handling of `target_as_index.values`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by a mismatch in the signature of the `get_indexer` method where the `target_as_index.values` argument cannot be properly processed or matched. This results in a `TypeError` being raised during function execution.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the signature of the `get_indexer` method is aligned with the type of argument being passed (`target_as_index.values`). This may involve modifying the method signature or converting the argument to a compatible type before processing.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # Remaining code remains same as in the buggy function.
        ...
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(np.asarray(target_as_index))  # Convert to numpy array before passing to get_indexer.
    else:
        # Remaining code remains same as in the buggy function.
        ...
        
    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, the key fix is converting the `target_as_index.values` to a numpy array before passing it to the `get_indexer` method to resolve the `TypeError`. This modification ensures that the signature of the method matches the type of the argument being passed, fixing the bug.
