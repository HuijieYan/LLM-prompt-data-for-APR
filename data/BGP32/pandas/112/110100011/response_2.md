### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_indexer` inside the `IntervalIndex` class is responsible for generating the index values based on the target array-like input.
2. The failing test `test_round_interval_category_columns` is related to handling `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex` in a DataFrame when performing the `round()` operation.
3. The provided GitHub issue describes the problem when using `round()` on a DataFrame with columns as `CategoricalIndex` created from `IntervalIndex`.
4. The bug seems to be related to the handling of `CategoricalIndex` from `IntervalIndex` in the `get_indexer` function.
5. The issue seems to be causing a `TypeError: No matching signature found`, indicating a problem with type conversion or handling during rounding.

### Bug Cause:
The bug may be caused due to incorrect handling or conversion of `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex` in the `get_indexer` function, leading to a `TypeError` during the `round()` operation.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the `get_indexer` function appropriately handles `CategoricalIndex` from `IntervalIndex` when generating the index values. Additionally, we need to ensure that the types are compatible during the rounding operation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target_as_index.categories, IntervalIndex):
        target_as_index = target_as_index.categories
    
    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # remaining code remains the same
    
```

By adjusting the handling of `CategoricalIndex` created from `IntervalIndex`, we ensure that the correct types are considered during the rounding operation. This should address the bug and make the test case `test_round_interval_category_columns` pass successfully.
