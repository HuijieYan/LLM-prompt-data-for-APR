## Analysis
The buggy function `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class has multiple issues that lead to a `TypeError` during the test execution. The error message indicates that there is no matching signature found when calling the `_engine.get_indexer` method. This occurs because the buggy function is overriding the `get_indexer` method without properly implementing it.

### Issues in the buggy function:
1. The buggy function `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class overrides the existing `get_indexer` method provided in the same class, but the implementation is incomplete and incorrect.
2. The buggy function does not properly handle the case for an `IntervalIndex` target.
3. The buggy function is missing essential logic for indexing calculations based on different index types.
4. The `_engine.get_indexer` method is being called without proper handling of the `target_as_index` parameter.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug in the `get_indexer` method arises due to an incomplete and incorrect implementation of the method. When the method is called with an `IntervalIndex` target, the buggy function fails to handle it correctly, leading to a `TypeError` during the test execution.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Properly implement the `get_indexer` method in the `IntervalIndex` class to handle different index types gracefully.
2. Ensure that the `target_as_index` parameter is processed correctly based on its type.
3. Integrate the necessary logic for indexing calculations within the method to match the expected behavior.

### Correction of the buggy function:

```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
        
        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
        
        # Ensure target is converted to appropriate Index type
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
        
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # Handle IntervalIndex targets
            if self.equals(target_as_index):
                return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
            else:
                return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
        else:
            # Handle other target types (scalar, etc.)
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index)
            return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

By correcting the `get_indexer` method with the provided code, the function should now properly handle different index types and avoid the `TypeError` that occurred during the failing test execution.
