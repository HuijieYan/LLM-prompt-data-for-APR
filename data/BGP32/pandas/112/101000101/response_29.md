## Bug Explanation
The buggy function `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class is attempting to retrieve the indexer for the target index based on certain conditions. However, there is a logical error in the code where the function is checking `if self.is_overlapping` without actually calling the `is_overlapping` method. This leads to a static check `if self.is_overlapping:` which is always true because it's checking the method itself as a boolean value rather than evaluating the method.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the function needs to call the `is_overlapping` method to get its actual value before checking it in the conditional statement. This will ensure that the logic around overlapping indices is correctly handled.

## The Corrected Version of the Function
```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)

        if self.is_overlapping():  # Call the is_overlapping method to get the actual value
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

        # Rest of the function remains unchanged
``` 

By modifying the conditional statement to `if self.is_overlapping():`, the corrected version of the function ensures that the `is_overlapping` method is called and evaluated correctly before proceeding with the logic. This fix should address the bug and meet the expected input/output values for the function.
