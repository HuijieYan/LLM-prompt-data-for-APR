### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class is re-defined with the same signature which causes conflict as the function is already defined in the class. This results in only the re-defined version being used, leading to missing functionality and incorrect behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the re-defined `get_indexer` function should be removed, and any intended changes or additions to the function should be incorporated directly into the existing `get_indexer` function in the `IntervalIndex` class.

### Corrected Version
```python
# Remove the re-defined get_indexer function from the buggy code

# In the existing get_indexer function, integrate any intended changes or additions to address the bug
```
