The bug in the provided function lies in the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class in the pandas module. The code attempts to perform specific operations based on the input parameters `target` and `self`. However, the implementation has logic issues that prevent it from correctly handling the cases where `target` is an `IntervalIndex`.

The main cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of `target_as_index` when it is an `IntervalIndex`. The code does not properly account for the situation where the input `target` is an `IntervalIndex` with overlapping intervals. This leads to incorrect behavior or potential errors when trying to match intervals between `self` and `target`.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the function to correctly handle the case where `target` is an `IntervalIndex`. Specifically, we need to ensure that overlapping intervals are properly dealt with and that the matching of intervals between `self` and `target` is done accurately.

Here is the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
# Assuming the corrections are made in the same file as the buggy function

# This is the corrected version of the buggy function
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype=np.intp)

        common_dtype = np.find_common_type([self.dtype.type, target_as_index.dtype.type], [])
        if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_dtype):
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

        left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
        right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
        indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = np.asanyarray(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index)
    else:
        indexer = np.array([self.get_loc(key) for key in target_as_index], dtype=np.intp)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In this corrected function:
- I have added the function call `self.is_overlapping()` as a method to correctly check if the intervals in `self` overlap.
- I updated the logic for handling `target` when it is an `IntervalIndex` to appropriately compare and match the intervals between `self` and `target`.
- I replaced the usage of `is_object_dtype` with `np.find_common_type` to properly determine the common type between the intervals in `self` and `target`.
- I ensured that the return variable `indexer` is converted to the correct data type using `ensure_platform_int` to match the expected output of the function.

These corrections should address the issues in the original implementation and provide the expected behavior for the `get_indexer` function in the `IntervalIndex` class.
