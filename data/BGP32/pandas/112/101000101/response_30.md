The bug in the provided function lies in the logic handling the `is_overlapping` attribute check and the subsequent comparison and indexing operations based on the attributes of `self` and `target_as_index`.

Explanation of the bug:
The buggy function incorrectly checks for overlapping indices using `if self.is_overlapping:` without actually calling the `is_overlapping` method. This check should be `if self.is_overlapping():`. As a result, the subsequent logic intended to handle overlapping and non-overlapping cases based on the `is_overlapping` result is flawed.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Correctly call the `is_overlapping` method to get the boolean result.
2. Adjust the logic flow based on the correct `is_overlapping` result to handle overlapping and non-overlapping cases appropriately.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
            if self.equals(target_as_index):
                return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
    
            # different closed or incompatible subtype -> no matches
            common_subtype = find_common_type(
                [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
            )
            if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
                return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    
            # non-overlapping -> at most one match per interval in target_as_index
            # want exact matches -> need both left/right to match, so defer to
            # left/right get_indexer, compare elementwise, equality -> match
            left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
            right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
            indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
        else:
            # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
            # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
            indexer = []
            for key in target_as_index:
                try:
                    loc = self.get_loc(key)
                except KeyError:
                    loc = -1
                indexer.append(loc)
    
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

This corrected version now calls the `is_overlapping` method correctly and adjusts the subsequent logic based on the correct result of the `is_overlapping` check. It should now handle overlapping and non-overlapping cases as intended.
