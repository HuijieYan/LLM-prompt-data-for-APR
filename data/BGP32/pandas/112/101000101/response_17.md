## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `get_indexer` within the `IntervalIndex` class is intended to handle indexing operations for IntervalIndexes. The bug seems to be related to the comparison and indexing operations on IntervalIndexes.

Here are some key points about the buggy function based on the provided information:
1. The function expects an IntervalIndex `self`, a target IntervalIndex `target`, a method (optional), a limit (optional), and a tolerance (optional) as input parameters.
2. It checks for overlapping indices in `self` using the `is_overlapping` method.
3. It validates the target index and performs different checks based on the type of the target index.
4. It appears to perform various operations such as matching positions, finding common types, checking for overlaps, etc., between `self` and the target index.
5. The function should return an indexer array that represents the matching positions or indices of the target values within `self`.

## Bug Explanation
Based on the expected values and types provided, there are a few key issues in the buggy function:
1. The condition `if self.is_overlapping:` should check the result of a method call `self.is_overlapping()` instead of checking the method object itself `self.is_overlapping`.
2. The return value or behavior when overlapping indices are encountered needs to be handled properly.
3. The conversion and comparison logic between `self` and the target index can be further optimized to ensure accurate indexing.
4. The return type of `indexer` may currently be inconsistent, which needs to be addressed.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to make the following changes:
1. Fix the condition to appropriately check for overlapping indices by calling the `is_overlapping` method.
2. Handle the case where overlapping indices are encountered by providing a proper error message or implementing a specific behavior.
3. Improve the logic for comparing the target and `self` Indexes to generate the `indexer` array accurately.
4. Ensure that the return type of the `indexer` array matches the expected output type (integers).

Here is the corrected version of the function based on the bug analysis and expected values:

```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:

        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            if self.equals(target_as_index):
                return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
    
            common_subtype = find_common_type(
                [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
            )
            if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
                return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    
            left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
            right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
            indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
        else:
            indexer = [self.get_loc(key) if key in self else -1 for key in target_as_index]
    
        return ensure_platform_int(np.asarray(indexer, dtype=int))
```

By making these corrections, the function should now handle the different scenarios correctly and return the expected values and types for the specified test cases.
