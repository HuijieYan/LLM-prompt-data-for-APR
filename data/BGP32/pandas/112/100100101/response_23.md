The bug in the `get_indexer` function arises from the incorrect handling of non-overlapping indexes in the case where the target index is an `IntervalIndex` and the `self` index is not equal to it. The code attempts to find matches between the left and right endpoints of the intervals in the `self` index and the `target` index, but due to the mismatch between the two indexes, the comparison logic fails.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic for finding matches between the intervals in the two indexes. Instead of comparing the left and right endpoints separately, we should compare the intervals as a whole to determine matches.

Here is the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

        indexer = np.full(len(target_as_index), -1)
        for i, interval in enumerate(target_as_index):
            for j, self_interval in enumerate(self):
                if interval == self_interval:
                    indexer[i] = j
                    break

    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by comparing intervals as a whole instead of left and right endpoints separately when finding matches between `self` and `target` indexes. This modification should resolve the bug and make the function behave as expected in the failing test case provided.
