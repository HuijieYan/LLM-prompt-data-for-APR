### Analysis
The bug in the `get_indexer` function seems to be related to the way it handles different types of input indexes. The function is structured to deal with multiple cases including equal indexes, different closed types, and overlapping indexes. However, there is a possibility that the function is not handling the case of a homogeneous scalar index correctly, leading to incorrect output.

### Bug Explanation
In the failing test case, the function is provided with an IntervalIndex as the `target` parameter. The function checks if `target_as_index` is an instance of `IntervalIndex` and proceeds to the relevant logic. However, in the failing case, the `target_as_index` variable does not seem to be correctly processed when it is an `IntervalIndex`, potentially resulting in unexpected outputs.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the logic that handles the case when `target_as_index` is an `IntervalIndex` is correctly implemented. Specifically, we need to make sure that the comparison, indexing, and processing steps for `target_as_index` are accurately executed.

### Corrected Function
Below is the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

        # different closed or incompatible subtype -> no matches
        common_subtype = find_common_type(
            [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
        )
        if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

        # non-overlapping -> at most one match per interval in target_as_index
        # want exact matches -> need both left/right to match, so defer to
        # left/right get_indexer, compare elementwise, equality -> match
        left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
        right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
        indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index) and isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # homogeneous scalar index: perform correct indexing
        indexer = np.arange(len(target_as_index), dtype="intp")
    else:
        # handle other cases
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)

```

By updating the handling of `target_as_index` when it is an `IntervalIndex`, we ensure that the correct indexing is performed, which should resolve the bug and make the function pass the failing test case.
