The buggy function is the `get_indexer` method within the `IntervalIndex` class. The method aims to return an indexer array based on the target values provided. It first performs several checks and operations based on the type and properties of the target values.

The buggy part is in dealing with the case where the target values are of type `IntervalIndex`. There is a logical flaw in comparing the left and right sub-intervals of the target with self, resulting in an incorrect indexer array. The primary issue is comparing left/right subintervals directly without considering overlapping cases.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):` block to handle overlapping intervals correctly and ensure the comparison of left and right subintervals aligns with the intended behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# Corrected get_indexer function
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

        common_subtype = find_common_type(
            [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
        )
        if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

        overlap_left = np.maximum(self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left), 0)
        overlap_right = np.minimum(self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right), len(self))
        indexer = np.where(overlap_left == overlap_right, overlap_left, -1)

    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In this correction, the comparison of left and right subintervals now correctly handles overlapping cases by finding the overlap ranges. This adjustment ensures that the indexer array generated aligns with the expected behavior, resolving the bug issue reported on GitHub.

This corrected version should pass the provided expected test cases and address the reported bug related to the round method failing when using columns of CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.
