### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_indexer` is designed to handle indexing operations for different types of indexes, including `IntervalIndex`. It performs checks and calculations based on the properties of the indexes involved.
2. The potential error locations in the buggy function include the handling of `target_as_index` when it is an `IntervalIndex`, the comparison of properties between different indexes, and the construction of the `indexer` array.
3. The bug might be related to the conversion and comparison between `IntervalIndex` instances. The function seems to handle various cases based on the types and properties of the indexes involved, but there may be an issue in the logic that leads to the failure with overlapping indices as reported in the GitHub issue.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison and calculation logic for non-overlapping `IntervalIndex` instances is correctly implemented. Also, handling the case of overlapping indices should be revised to address the issue reported in the GitHub problem.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function based on the expected input/output values and the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:

        self._check_method(method)

        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = "cannot handle overlapping indices; use IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            if self.equals(target_as_index):
                return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

            common_subtype = find_common_type(
                [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
            )
            if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
                return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

            # Check for overlapping indices
            has_overlapping = any(
                self.left[i] < target_as_index.right[i] and self.right[i] > target_as_index.left[i]
                for i in range(len(self))
            )
            if has_overlapping:
                raise InvalidIndexError("Overlapping intervals detected")

            left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
            right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
            indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
        else:
            indexer = [self.get_loc(key) if key in self else -1 for key in target_as_index]

        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

This corrected version includes additional checks for overlapping indices, ensuring that the function correctly handles this case. By checking for overlapping intervals before the comparison, the function should now be able to process the indexes without raising an error.
