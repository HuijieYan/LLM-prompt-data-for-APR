### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class is supposed to handle the indexing logic for IntervalIndex objects.
2. The main issue appears to be with the condition `if self.is_overlapping:` where the condition itself should be a method call `if self.is_overlapping():`.
3. The bug causes an InvalidIndexError to be raised when attempting to handle overlapping indices, which contradicts the expected behavior of handling such cases in a specific way. This leads to unexpected behavior when working with IntervalIndex objects.
4. To fix the bug, the condition `if self.is_overlapping` should be changed to `if self.is_overlapping()`. Additionally, the logic inside this condition may need to be reviewed to handle overlapping indices properly.

### Bug Fix:
```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping():  # Update the condition to call the method
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # Rest of the function remains the same
```

By making this change, the function should now correctly handle the case of overlapping indices and avoid the InvalidIndexError that was previously raised inappropriately.
