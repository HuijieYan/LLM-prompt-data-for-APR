## Analysis
1. The buggy function `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class is meant to handle indexing operations, specifically when the target is an `IntervalIndex`.
2. The issue arises when dealing with overlapping indices, causing an error to be raised instead of handling the operation properly.
3. The expected input consists of an `IntervalIndex` object with specific characteristics and target data as another `IntervalIndex`, to perform indexing operations correctly.
4. The bug in the current code is that when `self.is_overlapping` is True, it raises an error instead of handling the overlapping indices scenario appropriately.
5. To resolve this bug, we need to handle overlapping indices cases properly and ensure that the indexing operation is performed correctly.

## Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function within the `IntervalIndex` class:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        return self.get_indexer_non_unique(target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype='intp')

        common_subtype = find_common_type([self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype])
        if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

        left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
        right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
        indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        indexer = [self.get_loc(key) if key in self else -1 for key in target_as_index]

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version:
- The function now properly checks for overlapping indices using `self.is_overlapping()` and handles the case by calling `get_indexer_non_unique` method.
- Various scenarios for different types of target data are handled appropriately to ensure the indexing operation is carried out correctly.
- Errors caused by overlapping indices are resolved, and the function should now perform as expected.

This corrected version should address the bug and satisfy the expected input/output values as described.
