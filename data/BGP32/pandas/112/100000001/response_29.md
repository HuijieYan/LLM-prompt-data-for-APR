## Analysis:
The buggy function `get_indexer()` is designed to return an indexer array that maps the elements of a target array to the corresponding positions in the IntervalIndex. The bug appears to be occurring in the handling of overlapping indices and the calculation of the indexer.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The bug occurs when trying to handle overlapping indices in the `if self.is_overlapping` section.
2. The calculation of the indexer in the non-overlapping cases may also contain errors.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs due to incorrectly handling overlapping indices when the IntervalIndex is marked as having overlapping intervals. The function currently raises an error for overlapping indices, but the approach to handle and determine indexes for non-overlapping indices may be causing incorrect indexing results.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to review the logic for handling overlapping and non-overlapping indices. We need to ensure that the correct logic is applied to both cases so that the function can accurately determine the appropriate indexer array.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `get_indexer()` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "Cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    elif isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        common_subtype = find_common_type([self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype])
        if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
        left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
        right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
        indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In this corrected version, the logic for handling overlapping indices remains unchanged, while the calculation of the indexer for non-overlapping indices have been reviewed for accuracy.
