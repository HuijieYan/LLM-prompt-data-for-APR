### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_indexer` within the file `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py` is supposed to handle the indexing logic for IntervalIndex objects. This function is failing and causing an error related to a signature mismatch.
   
2. The failing test `test_round_interval_category_columns` is trying to round a DataFrame that contains columns with a CategoricalIndex created from an IntervalIndex. This test is supposed to pass but is failing due to the bug in the `get_indexer` function.

3. The error message indicates a type mismatch in the `get_indexer` function where the signature does not match the expected input type. This points to an issue within the function related to type handling.

4. The GitHub issue provides a clear description of the problem: when the columns are CategoricalIndex objects created from an IntervalIndex, the `round` method fails instead of working as expected.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `get_indexer` function is failing to handle the case where the target is a scalar value, resulting in a type mismatch error during rounding of the DataFrame.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, the `get_indexer` function needs to be updated to properly handle scalar indexes when dealing with IntervalIndex objects. Specifically, the code should be modified to handle scalar targets correctly.

### Corrected Version of the `get_indexer` function:
```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # previous logic remains the same
    
    elif is_scalar(target_as_index):
        return self.get_loc(target_as_index)

    else:
        # other cases remain as they were
    
    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

After fixing the `get_indexer` function as described above, the failing test `test_round_interval_category_columns` should pass successfully without any type mismatch errors.
