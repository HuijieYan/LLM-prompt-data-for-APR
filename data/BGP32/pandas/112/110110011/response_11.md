### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `get_indexer` within the `IntervalIndex` class, located in the file `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py`.
2. The error message from the failing test indicates a `TypeError: No matching signature found`.
3. The GitHub issue also describes a similar problem where the `round` method fails when columns are a `CategoricalIndex` of `IntervalIndex`.
4. The cause of the bug seems to be that the `get_indexer` function does not handle the case where the input is a `CategoricalIndex` properly, leading to a `TypeError`.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `get_indexer` function to properly handle the case when the input is a `CategoricalIndex`.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function within the `IntervalIndex` class:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike):
    if isinstance(target, pd.CategoricalIndex):
        target_as_index = target._codes
    else:
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    # rest of the function logic remains the same

    # Instead of using target_as_index.values directly, use target_as_index._codes when input is CategoricalIndex

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

By checking if the input `target` is a `CategoricalIndex`, we handle this case separately and extract the underlying codes to use in the rest of the function.

### Additional Note:
Ensure to include this corrected version in the `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py` file and run the failing test to verify that the issue has been resolved. This fix should allow the `round` method to work properly even when the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` of `IntervalIndex`.
