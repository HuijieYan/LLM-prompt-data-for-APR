### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `get_indexer` within the `IntervalIndex` class in the `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py` file.
2. The error occurs when trying to use the `round` method on a DataFrame with a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`.
3. The failing test `test_round_interval_category_columns` tries to round a DataFrame with columns as `CategoricalIndex` from `pd.interval_range(0, 2)`, resulting in the error `TypeError: No matching signature found`. The issue on GitHub also describes the same problem.
4. The bug arises due to the mismatched method signature in the `get_indexer` function when dealing with scalar inputs.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class when handling scalar input. Due to a mismatch in method signatures, the method fails to find a matching signature, leading to the `TypeError`.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to update the method signature of `get_indexer` to handle scalar inputs properly. We'll modify the signature to accept a `scalar_t` type as input.

### Corrected Version of the `get_indexer` Function:
```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: Union[scalar_t, AnyArrayLike],
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # Code remains the same as before
        # ...
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # Code remains the same as before
        # ...
    else:
        # Code remains the same as before
        # ...

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

With this correction, the `get_indexer` function should be able to handle scalar inputs correctly, resolving the `TypeError` issue observed in the failing test.
