### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class is causing issues when dealing with `CategoricalIndex` created from `IntervalIndex`. This function is meant to handle indexing within the `IntervalIndex` object. The issue reported on GitHub indicates a problem with `round()` method when columns are `CategoricalIndex` made from `IntervalIndex`.

### Identified Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of `CategoricalIndex` from `IntervalIndex`.
2. Incompatible behavior for rounding when columns are `CategoricalIndex`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug stems from the `get_indexer` method not correctly handling the `CategoricalIndex` derived from `IntervalIndex`. This discrepancy leads to a failure when applying the `round()` method on such columns.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the `get_indexer` method needs modifications to properly handle the case of `CategoricalIndex` derived from `IntervalIndex`. Additionally, ensuring compatibility for rounding operations when dealing with `CategoricalIndex` is essential for resolving the reported issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def get_indexer_non_unique(self, target, method=None):
        self._check_method(method)
        
        if self.is_overlapping:
            raise InvalidIndexError("cannot handle overlapping indices")
            
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
        
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            return super(IntervalIndex, self).get_indexer(target, method)
        else:
            return self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index, method=method)
```

In the corrected version of the `get_indexer` method, a new `get_indexer_non_unique` method is added to handle the case when the target is not an `IntervalIndex`. This method provides a way to index non-unique targets efficiently.

Make sure to integrate this corrected version into the existing `IntervalIndex` class to address the reported issue effectively.
