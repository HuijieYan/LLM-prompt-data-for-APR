### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class has a logical error where it checks for `self.is_overlapping` without actually calling the method `is_overlapping()` resulting in always evaluating to `True`. This leads to the `InvalidIndexError` being raised when it shouldn't be based on the data. 

### Bug Cause:
The issue arises from not invoking the `is_overlapping` method while checking its value. This causes the condition `if self.is_overlapping:` to always evaluate as `True`, leading to an incorrect behavior in the function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
The strategy for fixing this bug involves calling the `is_overlapping` method to get the actual result and adjust the behavior of the function accordingly. By invoking the method `is_overlapping()`, the correct logic based on the data can be implemented.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # The rest of the function implementation remains the same
        # .
        # .
        # .
```

By making this adjustment, the function now correctly checks for overlapping indices based on the actual result of `is_overlapping()` method, resolving the issue pointed out in the GitHub problem description.
