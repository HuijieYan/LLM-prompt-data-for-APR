### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class is designed to handle matching elements between two IntervalIndex instances.
2. The issue reported on GitHub mentions a problem with the `round` method failing when columns are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.
3. The error suggests a type mismatch or signature mismatch causing the `round` method to fail when dealing with CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex.

### Potential Error Locations:
- Type conversion between IntervalIndex and CategoricalIndex could be causing the `round` method failure.
- The implementation in the `get_indexer` function might not be compatible with the CategoricalIndex.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causing the `round` method failure is likely due to incompatible data types when converting from IntervalIndex to CategoricalIndex.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the `get_indexer` function in the IntervalIndex class to handle the case where the target is a CategoricalIndex derived from an IntervalIndex. This adjustment should ensure that the indexing operation works correctly with CategoricalIndex instances.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
        
        # Check if the target is a CategoricalIndex derived from an IntervalIndex
        if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target_as_index.categories, IntervalIndex):
            target_as_index = Index(target_as_index.categories)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # The existing logic for matching elements between two IntervalIndex instances
            ...
            # remaining logic as it is
            
        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            # The existing logic for handling scalar indexes
            ...
            # remaining logic as it is
        else:
            # The existing logic for heterogeneous scalar indexes
            ...
            # remaining logic as it is

        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```
### Explanation:
In the corrected version, we added a check to convert a CategoricalIndex back to an Index when it is derived from an IntervalIndex. This adjustment ensures that the `get_indexer` function can handle the conversion properly and make suitable comparisons between the target and the IntervalIndex instances.

By making this change, the bug related to the failure of the `round` method when dealing with CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex should be resolved.
