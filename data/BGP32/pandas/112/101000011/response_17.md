### Analysis:
The buggy function in the provided code is an attempt to get the indexer for a given target based on the IntervalIndex. The issue reported on GitHub describes a scenario where the `round()` method fails when the columns are represented as a CategoricalIndex derived from an IntervalIndex. This points towards a mismatch or inconsistency while performing operations on columns represented in this way.

### Identified error locations:
1. The code attempts to handle the case when the target is an IntervalIndex, which involves comparing left and right values. 
2. There are checks for different closed or incompatible subtypes, which might lead to erroneous behavior.
3. The code segment that handles the case of a homogeneous scalar index might have issues.
4. The handling of the case when the target is an object type might cause problems. 

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is likely to be caused by the mismatch in handling specific scenarios related to IntervalIndex columns when using the `round()` method, especially when presented as a CategoricalIndex. Potential issues might arise due to differences in the underlying structure and properties of IntervalIndex vs. CategoricalIndex, which can lead to unexpected behavior in the rounding operation.

### Bug-fix Strategy:
1. Ensure consistent handling of IntervalIndex and CategoricalIndex scenarios.
2. Validate the operations and comparisons involving left and right values in the IntervalIndex.
3. Check for object type cases to handle heterogeneous scalar indexes appropriately.
4. Ensure proper conversion and compatibility between different data types used in the operations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from pandas.core.indexes.interval import IntervalIndex

def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        
        common_subtype = find_common_type([self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype])

        if self.closed == target_as_index.closed and not is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
            left_indexer = self.left().get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
            right_indexer = self.right().get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
            indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
        else:
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, changes have been made to address potential issues causing the improper behavior when using the `round()` method with CategoricalIndex derived from an IntervalIndex. Additionally, corrected validation and handling of various scenarios related to IntervalIndex operations have been put in place to ensure expected behavior.
