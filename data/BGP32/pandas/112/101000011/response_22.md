### Analysis:
The buggy function within the `IntervalIndex` class is causing an error when dealing with `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`. The issue posted on GitHub highlights that the `round` method fails in such cases, demonstrating a failure scenario where the columns are `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

### Potential Error Location:
The error is likely originating from the `get_indexer` method in the `IntervalIndex` class, which is responsible for indexing targets based on the index. The code path for handling `CategoricalIndex` created from `IntervalIndex` may have a bug causing the issue.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `get_indexer` method in the `IntervalIndex` class does not handle the scenario where the target index is a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex` correctly. This leads to a failure when trying to perform the `round` operation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to enhance the logic in the `get_indexer` method to correctly handle the scenario when the target index is a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`. This may involve adjusting the comparisons and index handling within the method.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, (IntervalIndex, CategoricalIndex)):  # Handle CategoricalIndex
            if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex):
                target_as_index = target_as_index.categories  # Access categories for CategoricalIndex
            
            # The rest of the code remains the same
    
```

In the above corrected version, we have added a check to handle both `IntervalIndex` and `CategoricalIndex` for the target index within the `get_indexer` method. This adjustment should allow the method to properly index targets, addressing the issue raised on GitHub.
