### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class is causing a `TypeError` due to a mismatch in the signature of the method call.
2. The method receives a `target` parameter which is supposed to be a NumPy array-like object. It then tries to access the `values` attribute of `target_as_index`, which might be causing the error.
3. The error message is clear that it couldn't find a matching signature for the method call, which suggests that the type of `target` is not matching the expected input type.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `target` parameter passed to the method is of the correct type (NumPy array-like).
5. We should adjust the method's implementation to handle various types of `target` objects correctly.

### Fix strategy:
1. Ensure that the `target` parameter passed to the `get_indexer` method is compatible with the expected input type.
2. Check whether `target_as_index` is suitable for the subsequent operations.
3. Make necessary adjustments to handle different types of targets appropriately.

### The corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            ...
        elif is_list_like(target_as_index) and hasattr(target_as_index, 'values'):
            # Extract values from the object which is NumPy array-like
            target_arr = np.asarray(target_as_index.values)
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_arr)
        else:
            # Handle other types of target objects appropriately
            indexer = []
            for key in target_as_index:
                try:
                    loc = self.get_loc(key)
                except KeyError:
                    loc = -1
                indexer.append(loc)
    
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

By making the adjusted implementation as shown above, we ensure that the `get_indexer` method can handle different types of `target` objects correctly and avoid the `TypeError` issue that caused the test failure.
