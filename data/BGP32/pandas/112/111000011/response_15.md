### Analysis:

#### Buggy Function:
The buggy function is `get_indexer` within the `IntervalIndex` class. This function is responsible for generating indexers for the specified target. The bug seems to be related to handling overlapping indices and different index types.

#### Related Functions:
The `equals()` function is called within the buggy function to check if the indexes are equal. Also, the `is_overlapping()` function is called to determine if the indexes are overlapping.

#### GitHub Issue:
The GitHub issue reports that the `round()` method fails when columns are `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. The issue seems to be due to the mismatch between the data types when using `round()` on such columns.

### Error Location:
The bug is likely related to how the function handles the conversion of target indices for different types of input indexes, specifically in cases where the input is a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the function not handling the conversion and matching of the `CategoricalIndex` columns created from `IntervalIndex` correctly, leading to a TypeError when using the `round()` method on such columns.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `get_indexer` function in the `IntervalIndex` class correctly handles the case when the target is a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`. This may involve improving the conversion logic and matching process for such cases.

### Correction:

Here is the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        ...
    elif isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex):
        indexer = np.arange(len(target_as_index), dtype="intp")
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        ...
    else:
        ...
    
    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

By modifying the `get_indexer` function to correctly handle `CategoticalIndex` created from `IntervalIndex`, the bug causing the `round()` method to fail should be resolved.
