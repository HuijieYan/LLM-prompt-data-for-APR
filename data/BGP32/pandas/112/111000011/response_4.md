### Analysis:
The buggy function is `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class of the `pandas` library. The function is supposed to handle indexing based on certain conditions, but it has a bug that is causing it to raise an `InvalidIndexError`.

The function attempts to check if the index is overlapping using `self.is_overlapping`. However, `is_overlapping` is a method, not a property, so calling it directly without parenthesis will not give the desired result. As a result, this causes the function to always think the index is overlapping and raise the error.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by an incorrect usage of the `is_overlapping` method. Since it is being accessed without calling it as a method, the condition always evaluates to `True`, leading to the error being raised.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the `is_overlapping` method should be called with parentheses to correctly evaluate whether the index is overlapping. This will ensure that the appropriate checks are made before raising the error.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# Fixed buggy function to correctly call is_overlapping as a method
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # remaining code remains the same
```

By making this change to call `is_overlapping` as a method with `()`, the function will now correctly evaluate overlapping indices and prevent the error from being raised unnecessarily. This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug where `round` fails when using a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.
