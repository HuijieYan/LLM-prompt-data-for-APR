### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class is raising an `InvalidIndexError` if `is_overlapping` is `True`. This behavior is not consistent with the expected behavior according to the GitHub issue described.

### Error Location:
1. The condition `if self.is_overlapping:` might not be correctly checking for overlapping indices.
2. The error is raised with the message indicating a different method should be used, which is not the expected behavior.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `get_indexer` function wrongly detects overlapping indices, leading to an invalid error being raised, which is not in line with the expected behavior according to the GitHub issue description.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
The `is_overlapping` property should be correctly evaluated to determine if the indices are overlapping. Additionally, the error handling logic should be adjusted to match the expected behavior as described in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected version of the get_indexer function
def get_indexer(self,
                target: AnyArrayLike,
                method: Optional[str] = None,
                limit: Optional[int] = None,
                tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)
    
    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = "cannot handle overlapping indices; use IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        raise NotImplementedError(msg)
    
    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # Rest of the function remains the same

    # Remaining else branches remain the same

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, the `is_overlapping()` method is called correctly to determine if the indices are overlapping. It also properly handles the case of overlapping indices by raising a `NotImplementedError` instead of `InvalidIndexError`. This change aligns with the expected behavior mentioned in the GitHub issue.
