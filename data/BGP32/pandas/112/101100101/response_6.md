## Bug Analysis
The buggy function is a method within the `IntervalIndex` class where it tries to determine the indexer for a target based on certain conditions. The bug seems to be related to the handling of overlapping indices in the `get_indexer` method.

The bug is identified in the following part of the buggy code:
```python
if self.is_overlapping:
    msg = (
        "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
        "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
    )
    raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
```

The issue lies in how the check for overlapping indices is implemented. The condition `if self.is_overlapping:` is supposed to check if the index intervals are overlapping, but the `is_overlapping` method itself is not being called properly. This leads to the incorrect assumption that the indices are overlapping, resulting in the `InvalidIndexError` being raised.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to properly call the `is_overlapping` method to determine if there are overlapping intervals. Once we have the correct information about overlapping intervals, we can proceed with the logic of determining the indexer for the target based on the type of index and other conditions.

## Updated Buggy Function
Here is the corrected version of the buggy function with the fix implemented:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)
    
    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match ...
        # Rest of the function implementation remains unchanged

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

By calling `self.is_overlapping()` instead of `self.is_overlapping`, we ensure that the method is invoked correctly to determine if there are overlapping intervals. This should fix the bug and ensure that the `InvalidIndexError` is not raised in case of non-overlapping intervals.
