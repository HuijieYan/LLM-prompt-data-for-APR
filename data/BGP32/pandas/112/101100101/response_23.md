## Bug Explanation
The buggy function `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class is attempting to handle overlapping indices, but due to a logical error, it is not correctly identifying whether the indices are overlapping or not. The function incorrectly checks for overlapping indices using `if self.is_overlapping`, which will always evaluate to `True` due to the presence of the method `is_overlapping()` within the class. This leads to a misleading error being raised when the indices are not actually overlapping.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `get_indexer` function, the logic for checking overlapping indices needs to be revised. The correct approach would be to compare the intervals in the `self` and `target_as_index` objects to determine if there is any element-wise overlap. Based on this comparison, appropriate action can be taken.

## The Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

        # different closed or incompatible subtype -> no matches
        common_subtype = find_common_type(
            [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
        )
        if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

        # Check for overlapping intervals
        overlapping = np.logical_and(self.left <= target_as_index.right, self.right >= target_as_index.left)
        
        indexer = np.where(overlapping, np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp"), -1)

    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
        # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

By incorporating the correct logic for checking overlapping intervals using element-wise comparison of left and right bounds, the corrected function should now correctly handle overlapping and non-overlapping indices. This fix should ensure that the failing test case `test_round_interval_category_columns` passes as expected.
