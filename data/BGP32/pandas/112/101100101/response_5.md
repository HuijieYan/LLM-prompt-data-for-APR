## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class is supposed to handle indexing operations on `IntervalIndex` objects. However, there is a bug causing it to fail when dealing with `IntervalIndex` objects with overlapping intervals.

The bug is located in the logic where it checks for overlapping indices. When encountering overlapping indices, the function should raise an exception, but due to the incorrect logic, it fails to do so.

The problem lies in the condition `if self.is_overlapping:`. Here, `self.is_overlapping` refers to a method to check if the intervals overlap, but the condition is not calling the method properly, leading to incorrect behavior.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `is_overlapping` method is properly called to check for overlapping intervals. We should modify the condition inside the `get_indexer` function to correctly call the method `is_overlapping()` to determine if the intervals overlap. Then, if overlapping intervals are detected, we should raise an exception as intended.

## The Corrected Function
```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
            if self.equals(target_as_index):
                return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
    
            # different closed or incompatible subtype -> no matches
            common_subtype = find_common_type(
                [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
            )
            if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
                return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    
            # non-overlapping -> at most one match per interval in target_as_index
            # want exact matches -> need both left/right to match, so defer to
            # left/right get_indexer, compare elementwise, equality -> match
            left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
            right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
            indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
        else:
            # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
            # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
            indexer = []
            for key in target_as_index:
                try:
                    loc = self.get_loc(key)
                except KeyError:
                    loc = -1
                indexer.append(loc)
    
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

The corrected version of the function properly calls `self.is_overlapping()` to check for overlapping intervals. If the intervals overlap, it raises an exception as expected. This fix ensures that the function behaves correctly and passes the failing test case provided.
