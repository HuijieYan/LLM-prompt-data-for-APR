## Analysis:
The buggy function `get_indexer` in the `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py` file is failing to handle the case where the target is an IntervalIndex. It is attempting to compare the left and right sides of the intervals separately, which causes incorrect matching of intervals. This leads to incorrect indexing and mismatched results in the failing test.

## Bug Cause:
The bug seems to stem from the section where the function is trying to handle IntervalIndex as the target. It incorrectly compares the left and right sides of the intervals independently, leading to wrong matches and index assignments.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we match intervals properly by considering both the left and right sides together. Instead of comparing left and right sides separately, the function should modify its logic to compare the intervals as a whole to ensure correct matching and indexing.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected get_indexer function
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "Cannot handle overlapping indices; use " "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        
        # Compare intervals as a whole
        indexer = np.where(
            (self.left == target_as_index.left) & 
            (self.right == target_as_index.right),
            np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp"),
            -1
        )
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

By comparing the intervals as whole entities instead of separately comparing the left and right sides, the corrected function will now index intervals correctly even when the target is an IntervalIndex. This should resolve the bug and make the failing test pass.
