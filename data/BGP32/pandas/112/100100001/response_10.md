### Analysis:
- The buggy function `get_indexer` is used to calculate the index of each element in a target array-like object.
- The bug seems to arise from how the function handles different cases based on the type of the target array (`target_as_index`), specifically when `target_as_index` is an `IntervalIndex`.
- The bug occurs when attempting to compare the left and right boundaries of intervals for exact matches, leading to incorrect indexing.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect comparison of left and right indexers.
2. Issue with the logic for handling different cases based on the type of `target_as_index`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug likely stems from how the function tries to match intervals by comparing the left and right borders separately. This approach is flawed and leads to incorrect indexing results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of intervals is done correctly. Instead of comparing left and right indexers separately, a more robust approach could involve comparing the intervals as a whole.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        common_intervals = self & target_as_index  # Find common intervals
        indexer = np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        for idx, interval in enumerate(self):
            match = common_intervals.get_loc(interval)
            if match != -1:
                indexer[match] = idx
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        indexer = [self.get_loc(key, method=method, tolerance=tolerance) for key in target_as_index]

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

By modifying the comparison logic within the `get_indexer` function to compare intervals as a whole, we can ensure correct indexing for IntervalIndex objects.
