### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_indexer` in the `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py` file seems to be failing when trying to handle overlapping indices. The error message suggests that it cannot handle overlapping indices and advises using `IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique`.

### Potential Error Location:
The error could potentially be in the logic that handles overlapping indices within the `get_indexer` function.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by the implementation not correctly handling the case of overlapping indices, leading to an `InvalidIndexError` being raised.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to implement a proper solution to handle overlapping indices in the `get_indexer` function.

### Corrected Version:
Here is a corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        return self.get_indexer_non_unique(target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the existing code remains the same

        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

By modifying the logic to properly handle overlapping indices by calling `self.get_indexer_non_unique`, we can ensure that the corrected function can handle such scenarios. This should resolve the bug and make the failing test pass.
