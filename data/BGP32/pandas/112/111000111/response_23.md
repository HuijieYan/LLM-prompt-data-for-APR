### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_indexer` inside the `IntervalIndex` class is supposed to handle indexing for IntervalIndex objects.
2. The function has control flow to handle cases where the target index `target_as_index` is an IntervalIndex or a scalar index. It also makes use of left and right properties of the IntervalIndex objects.
3. The bug is raised when checking for overlapping indices; it should handle this case separately.
4. The function needs to ensure correct values and types for IntervalIndex properties and target index properties.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the condition `if self.is_overlapping:` is not handling the case correctly. The expected behavior is to check if the `is_overlapping` method is True or False, but it treats it as a method rather than invoking it to get the Boolean value.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the condition `if self.is_overlapping:` to `if self.is_overlapping():` to correctly check the result of the `is_overlapping` method.
2. Ensure that the properties and elements of `target_as_index` are correctly derived from the input target index.
3. Handle the case of overlapping indices appropriately by raising an error or handling it accordingly.

### Corrected Code:
```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
        
        self._check_method(method)
        
        if self.is_overlapping():  # Corrected condition to call is_overlapping as a method
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
        
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
        
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # Rest of the code remains the same
        
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

By correcting the condition to call `is_overlapping` as a method, the bug should be resolved and the function should behave as expected for the provided test cases.
