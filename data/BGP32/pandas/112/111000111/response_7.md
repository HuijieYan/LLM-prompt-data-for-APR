## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class is designed to handle indexing operations on interval data. The function checks for overlapping indices and then processes the target data accordingly.
2. The issue arises due to a check for overlapping indices that is not correctly implemented, leading to an `InvalidIndexError` when it encounters overlapping indices. This error is not handled in a way that allows the function to continue or provide a meaningful response.
3. The function expects `target` to be an `AnyArrayLike` object, which in this case should be an `IntervalIndex`. It performs checks and transformations on the target data to generate the indexing result. However, when encountering overlapping indices, it raises an error instead of handling the situation appropriately.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling overlapping indices. Instead of raising an error, we should determine a suitable behavior, such as marking overlapping indices or skipping them during the indexing process.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

## Corrected Version:
```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        indexer = np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target))
    else:
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            if self.equals(target_as_index):
                return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

            common_subtype = find_common_type(
                [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
            )
            if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
                return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

            left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
            right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
            indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
        else:
            indexer = []
            for key in target_as_index:
                try:
                    loc = self.get_loc(key)
                except KeyError:
                    loc = -1
                indexer.append(loc)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

By modifying the logic to handle overlapping indices appropriately, this corrected version of the function should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and provide the expected behavior during indexing operations on interval data.
