### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class is meant to handle indexing for overlapping intervals and return the appropriate index.
2. The function checks for overlapping indices, converts the target index, and computes the index accordingly.
3. The bug seems to be related to handling overlapping index cases and the conversion of the target index.
4. The issue likely arises when dealing with specific cases of target indices and the comparison logic between left and right intervals.
5. The reported GitHub issue relates to a problem with rounding when columns are initialized as a CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex. This could be a side effect of the buggy behavior in `get_indexer`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes incorrect indexing behavior when dealing with specific types of target indices, resulting in unexpected outcomes related to overlapping intervals or conversion issues. This inconsistency might lead to errors like the round method failing when columns are set as a CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure proper handling of overlapping indices within the `get_indexer` function.
2. Verify the conversion process of the target index to align with the expected behavior.
3. Check the comparison logic between left and right intervals to address any inconsistencies leading to incorrect results.
4. Ensure that the returned index aligns with the expected behavior according to the provided test case.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        
        common_subtype = find_common_type(
            [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
        )
        if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
        
        left_indexer_self = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
        right_indexer_self = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
        indexer = np.where(left_indexer_self == right_indexer_self, left_indexer_self, -1)
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index)
    else:
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, we have made modifications based on the understanding of the expected behavior and the bug cause. The function now properly handles overlapping indices, conversion of the target index, and comparison logic between left and right intervals to ensure correct indexing results.
