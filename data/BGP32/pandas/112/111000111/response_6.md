### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class has an issue where it raises an `InvalidIndexError` when it encounters overlapping indices in the `target` parameter. This behavior is not aligned with the intended functionality and leads to an incorrect result. The function is supposed to handle overlapping indices by performing specific operations but not raise an error in this case.

### Bug Cause:
1. The bug occurs due to the erroneous condition `if self.is_overlapping:` as it directly raises an error without handling overlapping indices.
2. The incorrect handling of the overlapping indices in the `get_indexer` function leads to the unexpected behavior and raises the `InvalidIndexError` prematurely.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the condition `if self.is_overlapping:` should be removed, and the logic to handle overlapping indices should be implemented as intended. Proper comparison and processing of overlapping indices need to be integrated into the function to correctly handle this scenario.

### Corrected Code:
```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
        self._check_method(method)
        
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
        
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            if self.equals(target_as_index):
                return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        
            common_subtype = find_common_type(
                [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
            )
            if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
                return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

            indexer = np.where(self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left) == self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right), self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left), -1)
        
        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
        else:
            indexer = [self.get_loc(key) if key in self else -1 for key in target_as_index]

        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
``` 

This corrected version of the `get_indexer` function should now handle overlapping indices appropriately and provide the expected behavior without raising any unnecessary errors.
