## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_indexer` within the `IntervalIndex` class of `pandas` is intended to handle matching indexes and coordinates arrays based on specific conditions.
2. The function handles different scenarios based on the type of input `target`.
3. The bug causes an error related to overlapping indices, where it raises an `InvalidIndexError` with a misleading message.
4. The error occurs due to a condition check `if self.is_overlapping` which should have been a function call `if self.is_overlapping()`.
5. To fix the bug, the `is_overlapping` property should be accessed by calling the `is_overlapping()` function.
6. By correcting the above issue, the function should correctly handle the case without raising the error.

## Bug Fix:
```python
# Fixed version of the buggy function
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    
    self._check_method(method)
    
    if self.is_overlapping():  # Fixed the issue by calling the method
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # remaining implementation

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

By fixing the bug in the `get_indexer` method, it should now properly handle the overlapping indices scenario without raising the `InvalidIndexError`. This correction aligns with the expected behavior and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
