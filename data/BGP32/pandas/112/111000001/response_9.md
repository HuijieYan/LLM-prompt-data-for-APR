## Analysis:
The buggy function `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class is supposed to handle indexing operations for interval indexes. The bug in the function seems to be related to the check for overlapping indices and the subsequent handling of different cases based on the type of index. 

## Identified Issue:
The bug lies in the conditional check `if self.is_overlapping`. Here, `self.is_overlapping` should be a method call rather than a boolean attribute check. The function `is_overlapping` should be called to evaluate if the current interval index overlaps with the target index. The bug causes incorrect behavior in the subsequent branching logic based on overlapping or non-overlapping cases.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Replace `if self.is_overlapping` with `if self.is_overlapping()` to properly check for overlaps.
2. Call the `is_overlapping` method where appropriate to handle overlapping cases correctly.
3. Verify the rest of the logic in the function to ensure proper indexing and handling of different types of indices.

## Corrected Version:

```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
            if self.equals(target_as_index):
                return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
    
            # different closed or incompatible subtype -> no matches
            common_subtype = find_common_type(
                [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
            )
            if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
                return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    
            # non-overlapping -> at most one match per interval in target_as_index
            # want exact matches -> need both left/right to match, so defer to
            # left/right get_indexer, compare elementwise, equality -> match
            left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
            right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
            indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
        else:
            # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
            # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
            indexer = []
            for key in target_as_index:
                try:
                    loc = self.get_loc(key)
                except KeyError:
                    loc = -1
                indexer.append(loc)
    
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

By fixing the issue with the conditional check and appropriately handling overlapping indices, the corrected function should behave as expected and avoid the bug that was present in the original implementation.
