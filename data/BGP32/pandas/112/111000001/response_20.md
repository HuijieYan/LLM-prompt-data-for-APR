## Analysis:
The buggy function is the `get_indexer` method in the `IntervalIndex` class. This method is supposed to return an indexer array corresponding to the target array. The purpose of this method is to find the positions of elements in the target array within the `IntervalIndex`.

## Identified Potential Error:
One potential error in the buggy function is the comparison `if self.is_overlapping:` without actually calling the `self.is_overlapping()` method. This may lead to a logical error in the flow of the function.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of the `self.is_overlapping` attribute in the condition check. The function should be `self.is_overlapping()` to call the method and get the return value, but it is currently missing the parentheses.

## Suggested Strategy to Fix the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the condition `if self.is_overlapping:` to `if self.is_overlapping():` to actually call the method and obtain its return value for the correct condition check.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():  # Fixed bug: calling the method
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # Rest of the code remains unchanged
```

With this correction, the function will correctly call the `self.is_overlapping()` method to determine whether the index values are overlapping and handle it accordingly.
