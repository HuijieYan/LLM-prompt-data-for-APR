## Analysis:
The buggy function `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class is intended to return an indexer for the target based on the current index. The issue in this function is related to handling overlapping indices. The buggy function uses the condition `if self.is_overlapping:` to determine if the index is overlapping, but `self.is_overlapping` is a method, not a property. Hence, the condition should be `if self.is_overlapping():`.

## Bug Cause:
The bug was caused by incorrectly referencing the method `self.is_overlapping` as a property without invoking it.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to call the method `is_overlapping()` to get the boolean result based on whether the indices are overlapping or not.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():  # Call the method to get a boolean result
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # remaining code as is
```

This corrected version addresses the bug by calling the `is_overlapping()` method in the `if` condition to correctly check if the indices are overlapping.
