## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_indexer` is defined within the `IntervalIndex` class, which is a subclass of `Index`. This function is responsible for returning an indexer array that represents the positions of elements in the target array within the IntervalIndex.
2. The buggy function calls the `_check_method` method from the same class to validate the method argument passed.
3. The bug arises when checking for overlapping indices in the `if self.is_overlapping:` condition. The check `if self.is_overlapping:` evaluates to `True` if the `is_overlapping` method is defined within the `IntervalIndex` class. However, this should be a method call instead of a property check.
4. The bug causes the program to raise an `InvalidIndexError` prematurely when it should be deferred until further validation. This could lead to incorrect indexing behavior or unexpected errors during execution.
5. To fix the bug, you should call the `is_overlapping()` method instead of checking for its presence directly in the condition. This change will correctly evaluate if the indexes are overlapping and proceed with further validation accordingly.

## Bug Fix:
```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # Rest of the function implementation remains unchanged
```

By making this change, you ensure that the `is_overlapping` method is called to correctly determine if the indexes are overlapping, rather than just checking its presence. This adjustment should fix the bug and improve the functionality of the `get_indexer` method within the `IntervalIndex` class.
