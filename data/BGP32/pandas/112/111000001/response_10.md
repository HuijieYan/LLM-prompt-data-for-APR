### Analysis:
- The given buggy function is `get_indexer` inside the `IntervalIndex` class.
- The function is supposed to return an indexer array based on the target input provided.
- The function uses several internal methods and properties from the same class to determine the correct indexer.
- The bug causes an incorrect behavior when handling overlapping indices.
- The function logic involves handling different scenarios based on the type of target index provided.

### Identified Bug:
- The bug is in the `if self.is_overlapping:` condition where the check for overlapping indices is not properly implemented.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The `self.is_overlapping` property is not being called as a function, resulting in a check that always evaluates to True (property existence is considered true in Python). This leads to the incorrect handling of overlapping indices.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, the `is_overlapping` property needs to be called as a function to obtain the actual boolean value that determines if the indices overlap.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:

        self._check_method(method)

        if self.is_overlapping():  # Call the method to obtain the actual boolean value
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # Remaining logic remains the same

        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

### Summary:
- By calling the `self.is_overlapping()` method instead of `self.is_overlapping`, we can fix the bug and ensure that the correct behavior is maintained when handling overlapping indices.
