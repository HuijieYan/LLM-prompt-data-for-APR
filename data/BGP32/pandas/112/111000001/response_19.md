## Analysis:
The buggy function `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class is attempting to handle indexing operations on interval indexes. However, there are several potential error locations within the function:
1. The function is missing a check for the `method` argument, which is required by the `_check_method` function called within the code.
2. The condition `if self.is_overlapping` is not called as a function (missing parentheses), so it will always evaluate to True.
3. There are several places where conversions between index types need to be properly handled to ensure compatibility.
4. The logic for determining matches between overlapping indices needs to be corrected.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of overlapping indices when trying to find matches between intervals. The incorrect evaluation of the `self.is_overlapping` condition and the missing implementation for different subtype handling in case of overlapping indices contribute to the bug.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Correct the evaluation of `self.is_overlapping` by calling it as a function `self.is_overlapping()`.
2. Implement a proper handling mechanism for different subtypes and overlapping indices.
3. Ensure proper conversion between index types for compatibility.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            if self.equals(target_as_index):
                return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
    
            common_subtype = find_common_type([self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype])
            
            if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
                return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    
            left_indexer = self.left().get_indexer(target_as_index.left())
            right_indexer = self.right().get_indexer(target_as_index.right())
            indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine().get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
        else:
            indexer = []
            for key in target_as_index:
                try:
                    loc = self.get_loc(key)
                except KeyError:
                    loc = -1
                indexer.append(loc)
    
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
``` 

This corrected version of the function addresses the issues mentioned above, ensuring proper evaluation of conditions, correct conversion handling, and appropriate index matching logic.
