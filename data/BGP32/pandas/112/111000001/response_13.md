## Analysis:
- The buggy function is `get_indexer` within the `IntervalIndex` class.
- The function has a conditional check `if self.is_overlapping:` which should call the `is_overlapping()` method to get the result.
- The bug seems to be related to the `is_overlapping` check, which should be a method call instead of a direct property access.
- The implementation is trying to handle overlapping indices, but the logic seems to be incorrect as it is not calling the `is_overlapping` method correctly.

## Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by directly accessing `self.is_overlapping` as if it's a property when it should be called as a method to get the result.

## Fix Strategy:
- Correct the bug by calling the `is_overlapping()` method instead of accessing `self.is_overlapping` directly.

## Corrected Code:
```python
# Fixing the buggy function by calling is_overlapping() method correctly
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the function remains unchanged

``` 

In this corrected version, `self.is_overlapping` has been changed to `self.is_overlapping()`, correctly calling the `is_overlapping()` method. This change should solve the bug and provide the expected behavior.
