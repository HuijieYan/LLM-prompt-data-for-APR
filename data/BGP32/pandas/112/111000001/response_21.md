## Analysis:
The buggy function is `get_indexer` within the `IntervalIndex` class. The purpose of this function is to return an indexer compatible with the target input. The function checks for overlapping indices and handles different scenarios based on the type of input.

## Bugs in the function:
1. The bug occurs in the following line:
   ```python
   if self.is_overlapping:
   ```
   The issue here is that `self.is_overlapping` is a method, but it is not being called as a method (missing parentheses). This results in the condition always being True, leading to the subsequent error being raised.

2. The return type `indexer` may not always be converted properly to integers due to `ensure_platform_int` being called without taking into account all possible types.

## Bug Cause:
The primary cause of the bug is due to not correctly invoking the `is_overlapping` method by missing the parentheses for the method call. This results in the condition always evaluating to True, triggering the error path.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Correctly call the `is_overlapping` method with parentheses to evaluate the condition properly.
2. Ensure that the return indexer is converted to the desired type for all scenarios to avoid potential type errors.

## Corrected Version of the function:
```python
# Updated and corrected version of the buggy function

def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the existing logic stays the same

    return np.asarray(indexer, dtype=np.intp)
```

This corrected version correctly calls the `is_overlapping` method with parentheses and ensures that the returned `indexer` is converted to an integer array using `np.asarray` to handle different scenarios properly.
