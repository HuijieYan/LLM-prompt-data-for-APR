## Analysis:
The buggy function is the `get_indexer` method within the `IntervalIndex` class in the `interval.py` file of the `pandas` library. This method is responsible for returning an indexer array that can be used to index into the interval index based on the provided target. The bug seems to be related to handling overlapping indices and finding matches between two interval indexes.

## Bug Location:
The bug seems to be in the following block of code:
```python
if self.is_overlapping:
    msg = (
        "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
        "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
    )
    raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
```
The issue is that `self.is_overlapping` is used as a condition without calling the `is_overlapping` method as a function, which means that the method itself is not being executed to check whether overlapping indices are present.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect usage of the `is_overlapping` attribute, which should be a method call rather than a direct attribute access. This means that the logic to handle overlapping indices is not correctly implemented.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to call the `is_overlapping` method and check its return value to determine if overlapping indices exist. This will ensure that the correct logic is applied based on the actual result of the method. By correctly incorporating the method call, we can address the issue.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `get_indexer` method with the bug fixed:

```python
    @Substitution(
        **dict(
            _index_doc_kwargs,
            **{
                "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                    """
        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError
            If any method argument other than the default of
            None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
        """
                )
            },
        )
    )
    @Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
            if self.equals(target_as_index):
                return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
    
            # different closed or incompatible subtype -> no matches
            common_subtype = find_common_type(
                [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
            )
            if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
                return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    
            # non-overlapping -> at most one match per interval in target_as_index
            # want exact matches -> need both left/right to match, so defer to
            # left/right get_indexer, compare elementwise, equality -> match
            left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
            right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
            indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
        else:
            # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
            # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
            indexer = []
            for key in target_as_index:
                try:
                    loc = self.get_loc(key)
                except KeyError:
                    loc = -1
                indexer.append(loc)
    
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, the `is_overlapping` method is properly called with `()` to check for overlapping indices before proceeding with the logic to find the indexer.
