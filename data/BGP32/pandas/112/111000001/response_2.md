## Analysis:
The buggy function `get_indexer` is a part of the `IntervalIndex` class in the `pandas` library. The purpose of this function is to return an indexer array to map the values to the indices in the `IntervalIndex`. The bug seems to be related to handling overlapping indices and identifying matches based on intervals.

## Bugs:
1. The condition `if self.is_overlapping` is incorrect. It should be a function call `self.is_overlapping()` to check if overlapping indices are present.
2. There is an issue where the non-overlapping case may not be handled correctly in the code.
3. There might be a mismatch in handling Interval Index types.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by using `self.is_overlapping` as a variable instead of `self.is_overlapping()` as a function call. This leads to incorrect behavior during the condition check. Additionally, there might be issues with handling non-overlapping indices and incorrect type comparison that results in the buggy behavior.

## Strategy for Bug Fixing:
1. Correct the condition `if self.is_overlapping` to `if self.is_overlapping()` to correctly check if overlapping indices exist.
2. Ensure proper handling of non-overlapping cases and datatype compatibility.
3. Validate the indexer array creation for different conditions and input types to ensure correctness.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            if self.equals(target_as_index):
                return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
    
            common_subtype = find_common_type(
                [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
            )
            if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
                return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    
            left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
            right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
            indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
        else:
            indexer = []
            for key in target_as_index:
                try:
                    loc = self.get_loc(key)
                except KeyError:
                    loc = -1
                indexer.append(loc)
    
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In this corrected version, `self.is_overlapping()` is called as a function to correctly handle overlapping indices. The handling of non-overlapping cases and data type compatibility is also improved for the expected behavior of the function.
