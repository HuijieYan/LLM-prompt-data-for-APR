## Analysis:
The buggy function `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class is trying to implement logic for indexing elements in an `IntervalIndex`. The function is supposed to return the indices of elements in the target index relative to the current index.

## Identified Issues:
1. The function defines `get_indexer` twice in the same class, which leads to a conflict.
2. The function does not actually implement the logic to calculate the indices correctly, leading to potential bugs in indexing.

## Cause of the Bug:
The main cause of the bug is the duplication of the `get_indexer` function definition in the `IntervalIndex` class. This will lead to confusion and unexpected behavior when calling the function.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the duplicate definition of the `get_indexer` function and make sure that the corrected function uses the correct logic to calculate the indices properly.

## Corrected Version of the `get_indexer` Function:
I will provide a corrected version that removes the duplicate function definition and implements the correct logic for calculating the indices.

```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        indexer = np.empty(len(target_as_index), dtype='intp')
    
        for i, key in enumerate(target_as_index):
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer[i] = loc
    
        return indexer
```

In this corrected version, I have removed the duplicate declaration of the `get_indexer` function, fixed the conditions and updated the logic to correctly calculate the indices for the target index. This version should address the bugs present in the original function.
