### Analysis:
The buggy function is `get_indexer` defined in the `IntervalIndex` class in the context of the pandas library. This function is intended to return an indexer that can map a target to the index of the `IntervalIndex` object. The failing test `test_round_interval_category_columns` tries to round a DataFrame with an `IntervalIndex` as columns, leading to an error within the pandas library.

### Identify the Bug:
The error occurs at the line `result = df.round()` in the failing test because the `round` method of the DataFrame internally calls the `get_indexer` function of the `IntervalIndex` object representing the columns. The error message indicates a `TypeError` with no matching signature found, pointing to the `get_indexer` function not behaving as expected.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug is caused by the existing `get_indexer` method in `IntervalIndex` being defined with the wrong input parameter, expecting `scalar_t[:] target` while the correct signature should have been accepting `AnyArrayLike target`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the signature of the `get_indexer` function in the `IntervalIndex` class to accept `AnyArrayLike` as the target parameter, aligning it with the correct data type expected in the function call.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # Code remains the same as before
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # Code remains the same as before
    else:
        # Code remains the same as before

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

By correcting the signature to accept `AnyArrayLike` for the `target` parameter, the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function should now work properly and pass the failing test.
