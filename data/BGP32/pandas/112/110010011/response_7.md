### Analysis:
- The buggy function `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class is causing a `TypeError` when the `round` method is called on a DataFrame containing columns as `CategoricalIndex` created from `IntervalIndex`.
- The error message indicates that there is no matching signature found for the `get_indexer` method while trying to index a scalar target.

### Error Location:
- The error seems to occur at the line where the `get_indexer` method is called with `target_as_index.values`.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug is triggered because the incorrect type of target is being passed to the `get_indexer` method. The method expects a `scalar_t[:]` target, but it is receiving a different type, leading to a `TypeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Ensure that the target passed to the `get_indexer` method is of correct type `scalar_t[:]`. If the target is not of the correct type, then convert it to the correct type before passing it to the method.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    @Substitution(
        **dict(
            _index_doc_kwargs,
            **{
                "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                    """
        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError
            If any method argument other than the default of
            None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
        """
                )
            },
        )
    )
    @Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
        
        if not isinstance(target_as_index, (np.ndarray, list)):
            target_as_index = np.array(target_as_index)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # remaining code without changes
```

By converting the `target_as_index` to an array if it is not already one, we ensure that the correct type is passed to the `get_indexer` method, resolving the `TypeError` issue.
