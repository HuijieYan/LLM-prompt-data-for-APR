### Analysis:
- **Bug Location**: The bug is likely in the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class within the `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py` file.
- **Error Message**: The error message indicates a `TypeError: No matching signature found` when the `round` method is called on a DataFrame with columns represented as a `CategoricalIndex` derived from an `IntervalIndex`.
- **GitHub Issue**: The reported issue states that when using the `round` method on a DataFrame with columns as `CategoricalIndex` from `IntervalIndex`, it fails due to the lack of a matching signature.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug is likely due to the presence of the `get_indexer` method in the `IntervalIndex` class, which might not be handling operations like `round` correctly when dealing with `CategoricalIndex`.
- The bug could also be related to incorrect handling of `IntervalIndex` in the context of rounding operations within the DataFrame.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- We need to ensure that the `get_indexer` method properly handles cases where the columns are represented by a `CategoricalIndex` derived from an `IntervalIndex`.
- It might involve adjusting the logic within the `get_indexer` method to properly handle column operations like `round` for such cases.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
        self._check_method(method)
        
        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
        
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
        
        if hasattr(target_as_index, 'interval'):
            # Check if target_as_index is IntervalIndex
            return target_as_index.get_indexer(self)
        else:
            return ensure_platform_int(self.get_indexer_non_unique(target))
```

In the corrected version, we've added a check for the presence of the `interval` attribute in the target index to identify if it's an `IntervalIndex`. If it is, we directly call `get_indexer` on the target index as `target_as_index.get_indexer(self)`. Additionally, we have added a condition to handle other cases by calling `get_indexer_non_unique` on the current index.

This corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing test related to the `round` method issue.
