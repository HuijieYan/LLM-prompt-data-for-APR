### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_indexer` in the `pandas\core\indexes\interval.py` file seems to be related to the GitHub issue titled "round method fails when columns are CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex." The bug causes an error with the `round()` method when the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

### Error Location:
The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. The condition where `if self.is_overlapping:` is being checked.
2. The part where the `IntervalIndex` is being handled.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused because the `get_indexer` function is not handling the case where the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` correctly. This leads to a `TypeError` when using the `round()` method on a DataFrame containing such columns.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `get_indexer` function to correctly handle the case where the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. This may involve adjusting the logic to properly handle the indexing in such cases.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
    if isinstance(target_as_index, (IntervalIndex, CategoricalIndex)):
        return np.arange(0, target_as_index.size)

    return ensure_platform_int(np.arange(0, target_as_index.size))
```

In this corrected version, we handle the case where the `target_as_index` is of type `IntervalIndex` or `CategoricalIndex` by returning the indexer with positions from 0 to the size of the target index. This approach should resolve the issue with the `round()` method failing on a DataFrame with such columns.
