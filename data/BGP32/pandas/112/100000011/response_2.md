### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_indexer` is related to the GitHub issue "round method fails when columns are CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex" because it deals with IntervalIndex objects, which are key components involved in the reported problem.

### Identified Errors:
1. The function checks for object dtype directly on the target index, which may not work correctly for IntervalIndex objects.
2. The function handles different types of target indexes (IntervalIndex, scalar index) but might not handle them properly for the reported issue.

### Bug Cause:
The function `get_indexer` does not handle the scenario where the target index is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex correctly. The direct handling of object dtype and indexing procedures lead to a failure when using the `round` method on such data.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles the case where the target index is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. This involves adjusting how the function interacts with different types of target indexes to support the `round` method correctly.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # Return np.array of data corresponding to the given target_as_index
        return self.asi8.get_indexer(target_as_index.asi8)
    else:
        # Return np.array of correct indexer or -1
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)

    return np.array(indexer, dtype="intp")
```

In the corrected version, we handle the target index type directly for IntervalIndex objects, ensuring a proper matching of data. For other cases, the function correctly looks up the indexes corresponding to the target index, as intended. This updated logic should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and allow the `round` method to work appropriately with CategoricalIndex made from IntervalIndex.
