### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_indexer` is related to the GitHub issue titled "round method fails when columns are CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex." The issue describes a problem where the `round()` method fails when columns are `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. This failure occurs due to the data type mismatch between the `IntervalIndex` and `CategoricalIndex`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. In the code where the function compares the data types: `if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):`
2. Converting `target_as_index` to a different data type: `target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)`

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `get_indexer` function is not handling the case where the target index is a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`. The type mismatch between `IntervalIndex` and `CategoricalIndex` leads to errors when trying to perform operations like rounding.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `get_indexer` function handles the case where the target index is a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`. This may involve converting data types appropriately and addressing any data type mismatches.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function that addresses the issue described in the GitHub problem statement:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    # Handle case where target is a CategoricalIndex created from IntervalIndex
    if isinstance(target, pd.CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target.categories, pd.IntervalIndex):
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target.categories)
    else:
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    # Rest of the function handling remains the same...

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, we have added a conditional check to convert the target index appropriately when it is a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`. We ensure that the data type match is suitable for further operations, preventing errors like the one mentioned in the GitHub issue.
