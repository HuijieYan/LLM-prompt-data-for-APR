### Analysis:
The provided buggy function `get_indexer` is a method in the `IntervalIndex` class in the `pandas` library. The GitHub issue mentioned relates to a problem where the `round` method fails when columns are `CategoricalIndex` of `IntervalIndex`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The issue arises from the way the `get_indexer` method does not handle `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.
2. The bug occurs when checking if the `target_as_index` is an instance of `IntervalIndex`. If not, it does not handle the case where it is a `CategoricalIndex`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the `get_indexer` method in the `IntervalIndex` class not properly handling the case when `target_as_index` is a `CategoricalIndex`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `get_indexer` method to handle the case when `target_as_index` is a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. This can be done by appropriately converting the `CategoricalIndex` to an `IntervalIndex` before further processing.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `get_indexer` method that resolves the issue mentioned in the GitHub problem:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # Remaining code as it is
        pass
    elif isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex) and all(isinstance(cat, interval.Interval) for cat in target_as_index.categories):
        # Convert CategoricalIndex of Interval categories to IntervalIndex
        target_as_index = IntervalIndex.from_intervals(target_as_index.categories)
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # Remaining code as it is
        pass
    else:
        # Remaining code as it is
        pass

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, we added a condition to check if `target_as_index` is a `CategoricalIndex` with Interval categories, then we convert it to an `IntervalIndex` before proceeding with the processing. This modification ensures that the `get_indexer` method can handle `CategoricalIndex` made from `IntervalIndex` as expected.
