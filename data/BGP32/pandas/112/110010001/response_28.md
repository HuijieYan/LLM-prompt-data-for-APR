### Analysis:
- The error message points to a type error when calling the `get_indexer` function.
- The issue seems to be related to the type of the `target` argument within the `get_indexer` function.

### Error Location:
- The error is likely to be happening due to the type declaration of the `target` argument.

### Bug Cause:
- The `get_indexer` function is expecting an argument of type `AnyArrayLike`, but in the failing test, it is being called with a different type not matching the expected type signature.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Update the type declaration of the `target` argument in the `get_indexer` function to match the type passed when calling the function. This way, the function call in the failing test will match the expected type.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: scalar_t,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
```

By changing the type hint for the `target` argument in the `get_indexer` function to `scalar_t`, we align the function signature with the expected type passed in the failing test. This change should address the type error.
