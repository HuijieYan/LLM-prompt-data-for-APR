### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `get_indexer` within the `IntervalIndex` class in the `pandas` library.
2. The function is supposed to handle indexing for IntervalIndex objects, but it has a bug related to handling overlapping indices.
3. The bug causes an error when trying to handle overlapping indices, leading to an `InvalidIndexError` being raised.
4. To fix the bug, we need to implement a method to handle overlapping indices properly without raising an error.
5. The error is caused when trying to match indices that are overlapping, and the fix should ensure proper handling of such cases.

### Bug Fix:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        return self.get_indexer_non_unique(target, method, limit, tolerance)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the function remains the same

        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, the `get_indexer` function now checks if the indices are overlapping and calls the `get_indexer_non_unique` method to handle such cases without raising an error. This revised approach ensures proper handling of overlapping indices and prevents the `InvalidIndexError` from occurring.

This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to the `round` method failing when columns are CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex.
