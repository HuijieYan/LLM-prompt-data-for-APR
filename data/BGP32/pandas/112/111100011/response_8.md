### Analysis:
The buggy function is `get_indexer` within the `IntervalIndex` class in the `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py` file. The function is responsible for handling indexing operations on `IntervalIndex` objects. 
Based on the provided code, the bug occurs when trying to round a DataFrame with a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, causing a "No matching signature found" TypeError.
The root cause of the bug seems to be related to how the indexing operation is handled for IntervalIndex objects with overlapping or incompatible subtypes.

### Issue:
The bug leads to a failure in the `test_round_interval_category_columns` test case due to the rounding operation failing when columns are a `CategoricalIndex` of `IntervalIndex`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `get_indexer` function within the `IntervalIndex` class not handling the case where the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` derived from an `IntervalIndex` properly. This results in a "No matching signature found" error during the rounding operation.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `get_indexer` function needs to correctly handle the case where the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` by ensuring proper matching of signatures and handling any conversions necessary to support the rounding operation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:

        self._check_method(method)

        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

        if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex):
            target_as_index = Index(target_as_index)
            method = None  # This line is added to handle the CategoricalIndex case

        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # remaining code as it is
``` 

### Updated Corrected Version:
The above correction ensures that the `get_indexer` function correctly handles the case when the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` derived from an `IntervalIndex`. Specifically, it converts the `CategoricalIndex` back to an `Index` and then proceeds with the remaining logic as usual. This is to ensure compatibility with the rounding operation and avoid the "No matching signature found" error.

By implementing this correction, the bug should be fixed and the `test_round_interval_category_columns` test should pass successfully.
