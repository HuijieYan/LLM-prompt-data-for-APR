### Analysis:
The buggy function is intended to retrieve the indexers for a given `target` array based on the `self` IntervalIndex. The bug seems to be related to a condition where the function checks for overlapping indices and raises an `InvalidIndexError` without proper handling. This issue is causing the failing test to encounter unexpected behavior when attempting to round interval category columns in a DataFrame.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises in the `get_indexer` function within the `IntervalIndex` class when checking for overlapping indices. If the condition `if self.is_overlapping:` is evaluated as True, it directly raises an `InvalidIndexError`. However, the comparison should be `self.is_overlapping()`, as `is_overlapping` appears to be a method, not an attribute. Due to this direct check without method invocation, the behavior is not as expected.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the `is_overlapping` method should be called properly as `self.is_overlapping()`. This adjustment ensures that the actual method is called to determine if overlapping indices exist. By making this change, the function should be able to handle the condition correctly and proceed with the logic accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function within the `IntervalIndex` class:

```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
            if self.equals(target_as_index):
                return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
    
            # different closed or incompatible subtype -> no matches
            common_subtype = find_common_type(
                [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
            )
            if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
                return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    
            # non-overlapping -> at most one match per interval in target_as_index
            left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
            right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
            indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
        else:
            # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
            # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
            indexer = []
            for key in target_as_index:
                try:
                    loc = self.get_loc(key)
                except KeyError:
                    loc = -1
                indexer.append(loc)
    
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

By making the correction in the `if self.is_overlapping():` condition, the function should now properly handle overlapping indices and avoid raising an error. This correction aims to resolve the issue with rounding interval category columns in a DataFrame.
