### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `get_indexer` within the `IntervalIndex` class. The function is responsible for generating indexers for a target array based on the IntervalIndex. The function handles different scenarios based on the type of the target index.
2. The code uses various method calls like `_check_method`, `is_overlapping`, `find_common_type`, and other related operations to determine the correct indexer.
3. The bug seems to be related to the handling of overlapping indices, as indicated by the error message raised in case of overlapping indices. The failing test case involves round operation on an IntervalIndex within a DataFrame that triggers this buggy function.
4. To fix the bug, the code needs to correctly handle overlapping indices and ensure the computation of the indexer is done accurately.
5. A correct version can be provided with the necessary modifications in handling overlapping indices and computing the indexers correctly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect handling of overlapping indices within the `get_indexer` function. The function raises an `InvalidIndexError` when encountering overlapping indices, leading to a failure in indexing the target. This behavior is not expected for the given test case, causing the test to fail.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `get_indexer` function to properly handle overlapping indices and compute the correct indexers for both overlapping and non-overlapping cases.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        return self.get_indexer_non_unique(target, method=method)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    # Handling non-overlapping cases
    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

        common_subtype = find_common_type([self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype])
        if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
        
        left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
        right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
        indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        indexer = [self.get_loc(key) if key in self else -1 for key in target_as_index]

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

By updating the `get_indexer` function with the corrected logic, we ensure proper handling of overlapping indices and accurate computation of the indexers based on the given target index type. This correction should address the bug and allow the test case to pass successfully.
