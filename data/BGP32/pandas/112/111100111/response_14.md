## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_indexer` within the `IntervalIndex` class is intended to deal with various cases including overlapping indices and scalar indexes, by comparing intervals, finding matches, and handling different data types.
2. The issue reported on GitHub indicates a problem with rounding when columns are a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`. This suggests a data type compatibility issue or a problem with the internal logic of indexing.
3. The failing test case involves using an `IntervalIndex` as columns in a DataFrame and then rounding the DataFrame, where it encounters a TypeError due to the mismatch between data types.
4. The buggy function is supposed to identify matching intervals between the target index and the current `IntervalIndex` instance, rejecting overlapping indices and handling different data types appropriately.

## Bug:
The bug seems to be related to the handling of intervals and determining matches between indices. It is likely that the bug causes a mismatch in data types when attempting comparisons between indices.

## Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper conversion and handling of data types, particularly when dealing with `IntervalIndex` and `CategoricalIndex`. Additionally, the logic for finding matches between indices needs to be correct.

## Corrected Code:
```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
            if self.equals(target_as_index):
                return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
    
            # different closed or incompatible subtype -> no matches
            common_subtype = find_common_type(
                [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
            )
            if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
                return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    
            # non-overlapping -> at most one match per interval in target_as_index
            # want exact matches -> need both left/right to match, so defer to
            # left/right get_indexer, compare elementwise, equality -> match
            left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
            right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
            indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index)
        else:
            # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
            # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
            indexer = []
            for key in target_as_index:
                try:
                    loc = self.get_loc(key)
                except KeyError:
                    loc = -1
                indexer.append(loc)
    
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

By ensuring proper data type conversion and correct logic for comparing indices, the corrected `get_indexer` function should be able to handle the test case involving rounding with `CategoricalIndex` columns created from an `IntervalIndex`.
