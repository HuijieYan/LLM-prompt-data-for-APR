The bug in the provided `get_indexer` function seems to be related to how the target index is handled and converted in the different branches of the function. The function aims to return an indexer for the target index based on the current `IntervalIndex` instance.

The bug occurs in the following line:
```python
indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
```

The issue with this line is that in the case where `target_as_index` is not an `IntervalIndex`, the function should create an indexer based on the values of the target index. However, the current implementation tries to call `_engine.get_indexer` directly on `target_as_index.values`, assuming that `_engine` can handle the conversion. This leads to a potential mismatch or an incorrect indexing operation.

To fix this bug, we need to create a new indexer based on the values of `target_as_index` in a way that is compatible with the rest of the function's logic. We can achieve this by creating a new branch specifically for this case and handle the conversion properly.

Here is the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)
    
    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the existing logic remains the same
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index)
    else:
        # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
        # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

This corrected version adds a specific branch for handling the case where `target_as_index` is not an `IntervalIndex`. It now properly creates an indexer by calling `_engine.get_indexer` on `target_as_index`, ensuring compatibility with the function's logic.

This corrected version should now satisfy the expected input/output values for the provided test cases.
