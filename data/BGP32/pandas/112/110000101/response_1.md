The bug in the provided function lies in the line where the target is converted to an Index using the `ensure_index` function. This conversion causes the target_as_index variable to lose the IntervalIndex properties, which leads to incorrect behavior further down in the function.

To fix this issue, we should modify the code to keep the target_as_index variable as an IntervalIndex instead of converting it to a regular Index. This can be achieved by removing the `ensure_index` function call for the target variable.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    # Removing the conversion of target to Index
    target_as_index = target

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        ...
``` 

By making this change, the function will correctly preserve the IntervalIndex properties of the target variable, ensuring that the function operates as expected when handling IntervalIndex objects.
