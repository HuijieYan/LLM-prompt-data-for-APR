The bug in the provided function `get_indexer` lies in the conditional check for `self.is_overlapping`. There is a logical error in handling overlapping indices, specifically when checking if `self.is_overlapping` is True.

The bug is causing an `InvalidIndexError` to be raised when attempting to handle overlapping indices, instructing the user to use `IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique` instead. However, the code does not provide an implementation or reference to `IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique`, leading to confusion and potential errors for users encountering this situation.

To fix this bug, we need to revise the logic for handling overlapping indices. There are multiple ways to approach this, such as implementing support for overlapping indices within the current function or providing a clear explanation and guidance to users on how to handle overlapping indices.

Here is the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "Cannot handle overlapping indices. Please use IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique."
        )
        raise NotImplementedError(msg)  # Providing a clearer error message

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # Rest of the function remains the same as it handles non-overlapping indices
        # Handle non-overlapping indices as before
    else:
        # Handle heterogeneous scalar index
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, we have replaced the `InvalidIndexError` with a `NotImplementedError` to provide more clarity to users and advise them to use `IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique` for handling overlapping indices. This change helps to improve the user experience by providing clear instructions on how to handle the specific case of overlapping indices.
