The buggy function `get_indexer` within the `IntervalIndex` class in the `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py` file has a bug that can cause unexpected behavior when handling overlapping indices. 

### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_indexer` is designed to return an indexer array based on a target array passed as an argument. The bug occurs when `self.is_overlapping` is `True`, triggering an `InvalidIndexError` with the message suggesting the use of `IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique`, but the implementation of `get_indexer_non_unique` is missing.

### Potential Error Location:
Based on the code:
```python
if self.is_overlapping:
    msg = (
        "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
        "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
    )
    raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
```
The error is likely caused by `self.is_overlapping` being `True` without a corresponding implementation to handle overlapping indices.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `get_indexer` function arises when it encounters overlapping indices, which are not handled correctly due to the missing implementation of `get_indexer_non_unique`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to implement the missing `get_indexer_non_unique` method in the `IntervalIndex` class to handle overlapping indices properly. This method should provide a mechanism to return the desired output when dealing with overlapping indices.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function with a placeholder for `get_indexer_non_unique` implementation:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        return self.get_indexer_non_unique(target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)

    # Rest of the function logic remains the same

def get_indexer_non_unique(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    # Placeholder implementation for handling overlapping indices
    msg = "Handling overlapping indices is not yet implemented"
    raise NotImplementedError(msg)
```

By adding the `get_indexer_non_unique` method with appropriate logic to handle overlapping indices, the bug can be fixed in the `get_indexer` function.
