The bug in the function `get_indexer` of the `IntervalIndex` class is that it is not properly handling the case when `is_overlapping` is True. This leads to an `InvalidIndexError` being raised with a message implying that the overlapping indices cannot be handled, but it suggests using `IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique`, which is not implemented.

To fix this bug, you can modify the function to properly handle the case of overlapping indices. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        # Handle overlapping indices
        return self.get_indexer_non_unique(target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    # Remaining code remains the same
```

By adding a conditional check to handle the case of overlapping indices and redirecting the operation to `get_indexer_non_unique` method, the bug can be fixed. This will ensure that the function behaves correctly when encountering overlapping indices within the `IntervalIndex` class.
