The bug in the provided function `get_indexer` may occur due to the way the indexing is handled for IntervalIndex objects. The bug seems to be related to the implementation of the logic inside the function that compares and matches intervals between two IntervalIndex objects.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the intervals are overlapping or not before attempting to match them. If the intervals are overlapping, we should raise an error as it is not supported in this implementation.

Here is the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        
        if self.closed != target_as_index.closed:
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

        left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
        right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
        indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, we now explicitly check for overlapping intervals before attempting to match them. If the intervals are found to be overlapping, an error will be raised. Additionally, the logic for checking closed intervals between `self` and `target_as_index` has been simplified to avoid unnecessary comparison steps.

By following these corrections, the bug in the `get_indexer` function should be fixed.
