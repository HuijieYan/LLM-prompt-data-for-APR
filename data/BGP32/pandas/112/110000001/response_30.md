## Analysis:
1. The `get_indexer` function within the `IntervalIndex` class is designed to return an indexer based on a target array-like object.
2. The function first checks if the method is valid and then proceeds to handle different cases based on the type of the target array-like object.
3. There are conditions for handling `IntervalIndex` target objects, homogeneous scalar index target objects, and heterogeneous scalar index target objects.
4. The bug seems to be related to the handling of the indexer when checking for overlaps in the target indexes.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the handling of overlapping indices within the `IntervalIndex` target. If the target index contains overlapping intervals, an `InvalidIndexError` is raised with a message suggesting an alternative method to use (`IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique`). This approach is not ideal and leads to incorrect behavior because the check for overlapping indices is not properly handled.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `get_indexer` function, we need to properly handle the case of overlapping indices in the target `IntervalIndex`. Instead of raising an error, we should implement a strategy to handle overlapping intervals and create an indexer accordingly.

## Corrected Version:
```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping:
            # Handle overlapping indices
            return self.get_indexer_non_unique(target)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # Remaining code for handling IntervalIndex targets...
```

In the corrected version above, the bug is fixed by calling a new method `get_indexer_non_unique` to handle overlapping indices in the target `IntervalIndex`. This approach ensures that the code does not raise an error when encountering overlapping intervals and provides a proper strategy to create an indexer in such cases.
