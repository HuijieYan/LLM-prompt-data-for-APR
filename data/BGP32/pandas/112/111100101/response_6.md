## Bug Analysis
The buggy function in the `IntervalIndex` class is attempting to implement the `get_indexer` method. However, it has a bug where it is not properly handling the case in which the `self.is_overlapping` attribute is True. This results in incorrect behavior when encountering overlapping indices.

## Bug Explanation
1. The bug occurs in the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class.
2. The bug arises in the conditional check `if self.is_overlapping:` where the intention is likely to handle overlapping indexes but the condition is not being correctly evaluated.
3. When encountering overlapping indexes, the buggy function attempts to raise an `InvalidIndexError`, but it is not being triggered due to the incorrect conditional logic.
4. As a result, the buggy function proceeds to process the overlapping indexes incorrectly, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug in the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class:
1. Correct the conditional check for `self.is_overlapping` to properly evaluate whether overlapping indexes are present.
2. If `self.is_overlapping` is True, raise an `InvalidIndexError` as intended to handle the case of overlapping indexes.
3. Ensure that after fixing the handling of overlapping indexes, the function proceeds with the correct logic for non-overlapping and other types of indexes.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping(): # Correcting the check for overlapping indices
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # Remaining code as is
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # Remaining code as is
    else:
        # Remaining code as is

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

With the above correction, the `get_indexer` method in the `IntervalIndex` class should now properly handle the case of overlapping indices and function as expected for various types of indexes.
