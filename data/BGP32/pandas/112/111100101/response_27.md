## Analysis
The buggy function is `get_indexer` within the `IntervalIndex` class. The function is meant to compute indexers for matching elements in two `IntervalIndex` objects. However, there are several issues in the function that lead to failures. 

### Identified Issues:
1. The `get_indexer` function is defined twice within the class, causing ambiguity and likely leading to incorrect behavior.
2. The comparison logic inside the function is flawed and does not correctly handle overlapping or non-overlapping intervals.
3. The approach to handling different types of input is not consistent and may lead to unexpected results for heterogeneous scalar indexes.
4. The implementation of indexer generation for interval matching is incorrect and needs to be revised.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is primarily caused by the incorrect logic for handling interval matching and the potential confusion resulting from the duplicate definition of the `get_indexer` function within the class.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Remove the duplicate definition of the `get_indexer` function within the `IntervalIndex` class.
2. Revise the logic for interval matching to correctly handle overlapping and non-overlapping intervals.
3. Ensure consistent handling of different types of input to the function.
4. Update the implementation of indexer generation to accurately identify matching intervals.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            if self.equals(target_as_index):
                return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
    
            common_subtype = find_common_type(
                [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
            )
            if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
                return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    
            left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
            right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
            indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
        
        else:
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the identified issues and should now properly handle interval matching and generate the correct indexers according to the expected input/output values.
