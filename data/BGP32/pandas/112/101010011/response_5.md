### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_indexer` within the `IntervalIndex` class is attempting to round the values in the DataFrame, but it fails with a `TypeError: No matching signature found` error when the columns are of type `CategoricalIndex` created from `IntervalIndex`.
2. The `get_indexer` function is a critical part of the `IntervalIndex` class responsible for handling indexers for various operations.
3. The error message indicates that the issue arises from a method signature mismatch, possibly due to the type of input passed to the function.
4. The bug is causing the DataFrame's `round` method to fail when columns are of type `CategoricalIndex` created from `IntervalIndex`.
5. To fix the bug, the input type being passed to the `get_indexer` function needs to be handled properly to resolve the mismatch.

### Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, we need to modify the handling of input types to ensure compatibility with the `get_indexer` function inside the `IntervalIndex` class. Specifically, focus on adequately processing the target index to resolve the `TypeError` due to the mismatch in method signature.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: Union[AnyArrayLike, "Index"],
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
        
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        if isinstance(target, Index):
            target_as_index = target
        else:
            target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # rest of the function remains unchanged

        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

By explicitly checking if the input `target` is an instance of `Index` before processing it with `ensure_index`, we ensure the proper type for further operations. This correction should allow the `round` method to work correctly even with `CategoricalIndex` columns derived from `IntervalIndex`.
