### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_indexer` is designed to handle indexing operations for interval indexes. One key issue occurs when checking for overlapping indices, leading to an `InvalidIndexError` being raised. This behavior does not align with the expected behavior of the function and needs to be corrected.

### Error Cause:
The error occurs when the function encounters overlapping indices in the `self` attribute of type `IntervalIndex`. The condition `if self.is_overlapping` is incorrect due to the direct use of `self.is_overlapping`, which might not reflect the actual presence of overlapping indices.

### Solution Strategy:
To fix this bug:
1. Ensure that the function checks for actual overlapping indices correctly within the `IntervalIndex` object.
2. Modify the condition to reflect the correct behavior when encountering overlapping indices in `self`.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the function `get_indexer`:
```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    overlapping_indices = self.overlaps(target)  # Check for overlapping intervals

    if overlapping_indices.any():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # Remaining code as is...
```

In the corrected version, `overlaps` is used to determine overlapping indices, ensuring the condition check is accurate. This modification aligns with the expected behavior and resolves the issue of raising `InvalidIndexError` incorrectly.
