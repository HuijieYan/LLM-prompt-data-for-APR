### Analysis:
The `get_indexer` function is responsible for determining the index positions of elements in the target array corresponding to the IntervalIndex. The issue seems to arise when the target is a CategoricalIndex created from an IntervalIndex, resulting in a failure during rounding operations.

### Identified potential error locations:
1. Conversion of target data to `ensure_index` might not be suitable for CategoricalIndex.
2. Handling of methods for target when target is a CategoricalIndex.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs due to the mismatch in handling CategoricalIndex created from an IntervalIndex when calling the `get_indexer` function. The specific case of rounding operations reveals the issue of conversion and method handling.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the handling of CategoricalIndex and ensure compatibility with IntervalIndex operations within the `get_indexer` function.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
        
        # Adjust handling for CategoricalIndex
        if isinstance(target, CategoricalIndex):
            target_as_index = target.categories
        else:
            target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
        
        self._check_method(method)
        
        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
        
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # Rest of the function remains as is
            
``` 

By making the adjustment to handle `CategoricalIndex` within the `get_indexer` function, we ensure compatibility with the expected use case mentioned in the GitHub issue.
