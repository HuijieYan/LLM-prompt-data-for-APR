### Analysis and Bug Identification:
The buggy function `get_indexer` in the `interval.py` file is intended to return an indexer array for IntervalIndex objects. The bug is likely related to the mismatch of expected and actual data types due to improper handling of target_as_index which should be an IntervalIndex, but may not be correctly identified by the function.

The function checks if `target_as_index` is an instance of IntervalIndex and then performs different operations based on that condition. However, there are potential issues in handling the data types of `target_as_index` and the subsequent operations on it.

The expected case provided gives insights into the necessary data types and values at various stages of the function execution which highlight potential data type mismatches or mishandling that may lead to the bug.

### Bug Cause:
In the buggy function `get_indexer`, the main cause of the bug is likely the improper handling of `target_as_index` data types, especially when dealing with IntervalIndex objects. The function expects specific data types and structures for `target_as_index` based on IntervalIndex properties, but the function's logic may not handle these types correctly, leading to errors.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `target_as_index` variable is correctly identified and processed as an IntervalIndex object by appropriately handling its data types and properties. This may involve type-checking, conversion, or restructuring based on the expected types and structures outlined in the expected case.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

        common_subtype = find_common_type(
            [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
        )
        if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

        left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
        right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
        indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index.values)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index)
    else:
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

By ensuring proper handling of data types for `target_as_index` and maintaining the expected structure, this corrected function should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and satisfy the provided expected case.
