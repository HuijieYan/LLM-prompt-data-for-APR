## Fixing the Bug

### 1. Analysis:
The buggy function in the `IntervalIndex` class is `get_indexer`. The purpose of this function is to return an indexer which can be used to lookup the location of elements from a target array within the index. The buggy function has issues related to handling overlapping indices, different index types, and scalar keys.

### 2. Potential Error Locations:
The bug is likely to be related to how overlapping indices are handled, validation of index types, and the handling of scalar keys in the `get_indexer` function.

### 3. Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of overlapping indices, differences in closed intervals, and incompatible subtypes when trying to match the input index with the target index.

### 4. Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the logic for handling overlapping indices, different closed intervals, and scalar keys is correct. This includes handling the scenario where there are common subtypes between the input and target indices, ensuring exact matches are made, and properly converting scalar keys to integer indexes when necessary.

### 5. Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        raise NotImplementedError("Overlapping indices are not supported yet.")

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

        common_subtype = find_common_type(
            [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
        )
        if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

        left_indexer = self.left().get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
        right_indexer = self.right().get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
        indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)

    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        indexer = np.array([self.get_loc(key) for key in target_as_index], dtype='intp')

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `get_indexer` function should now properly handle overlapping indices, different index types, and scalar keys. It has been modified to address the issues identified in the buggy function. This corrected version should now pass the failing test as provided.
