## Analysis:
The buggy function `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class seems to have an issue related to handling overlapping indices. When the method detects overlapping indices, it raises an `InvalidIndexError` with a message indicating that it cannot handle overlapping indices.

However, the condition `if self.is_overlapping:` in the buggy function is checking the reference to the method `is_overlapping` itself rather than calling the method to get its result. This causes the condition to always be truthy since a method reference is considered true in Python.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by using `self.is_overlapping` directly within the conditional check, which does not properly evaluate the result of the `is_overlapping` method.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the `is_overlapping` method should be called by adding parentheses `()` after the method name to get the actual result of the method invocation. This will correctly evaluate whether the index overlaps and handle the logic accordingly.

## Corrected Version:
```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # rest of the logic remains the same
            ...
```

By adding `()` after `is_overlapping`, we ensure that the method is called and its result is used in the conditional check. This correction should address the bug and allow the function to handle overlapping indices properly.
