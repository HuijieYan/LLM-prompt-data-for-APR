### Analysis:
The buggy function `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class has a logic issue that causes it to fail the test case provided. The problem arises when handling overlapping indices, leading to an `InvalidIndexError` being raised. Additionally, the comparison logic for finding matching intervals between the target index and the current index needs to be refined.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of overlapping indices in the `get_indexer` function. When encountering overlapping indices, the function attempts to raise an error instead of dealing with the overlap condition. This behavior is not aligned with the expected functionality.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `get_indexer` function to properly handle the case of overlapping indices without raising an error. Additionally, the comparison logic for finding matching intervals between the target index and the current index needs to be adjusted for better accuracy.

### Corrected Version of the `get_indexer` Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function in the `IntervalIndex` class:

```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:

        self._check_method(method)

        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            if self.equals(target_as_index):
                return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

            common_subtype = find_common_type(
                [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
            )
            if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
                return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

            left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
            right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
            indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)            
        else:
            indexer = np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

By making the above corrections to the `get_indexer` function, the bug should be fixed, and the failing test case should pass successfully.
