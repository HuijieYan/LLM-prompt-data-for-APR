## Analysis:
The buggy function is `get_indexer` within the `IntervalIndex` class. The function is supposed to return an indexer for the target values based on the intervals in the `IntervalIndex`. The bug seems to be related to handling overlapping indices and the logic for matching intervals between the `IntervalIndex` and the target.

## Bug:
The bug occurs when checking for overlapping indices. The condition `if self.is_overlapping:` is supposed to check if the index has overlapping intervals, but `is_overlapping` is a method of the class, not an attribute, so it should be called as a method `self.is_overlapping()` instead of `self.is_overlapping` which always evaluates to `True` causing the error to always occur.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Correctly call the `is_overlapping` method as `self.is_overlapping()` to obtain the actual result.
2. Review the logic for handling different cases of target index types and ensure compatibility.

## Updated Corrected Version:
```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
            if self.equals(target_as_index):
                return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
    
            # different closed or incompatible subtype -> no matches
            common_subtype = find_common_type(
                [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
            )
            if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
                return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    
            # non-overlapping -> at most one match per interval in target_as_index
            # want exact matches -> need both left/right to match, so defer to
            # left/right get_indexer, compare elementwise, equality -> match
            left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
            right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
            indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
        else:
            # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
            # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
            indexer = []
            for key in target_as_index:
                try:
                    loc = self.get_loc(key)
                except KeyError:
                    loc = -1
                indexer.append(loc)
    
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
``` 

By making this change in the `get_indexer` function, the bug related to overlapping indices is resolved and the corrected version should now pass the failing test mentioned.
