The buggy function `get_indexer` is checking for overlapping indices using `self.is_overlapping`, which is a method, instead of invoking it to retrieve the boolean result. This leads to a logical error where the check for overlapping indices is never performed correctly.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to correctly call the `is_overlapping` method to retrieve the boolean result and perform the logic based on that result.

Here is the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)
    
    if self.is_overlapping():  # Correctly call the method to get the boolean result
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the code remains the same
``` 

By making this change, the function will correctly handle the check for overlapping indices and operate as expected based on the boolean result retrieved from the `is_overlapping` method.
