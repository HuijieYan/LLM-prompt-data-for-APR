## Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided function `get_indexer` is that it is trying to access the attribute `is_overlapping` directly as a property without calling it as a method. `is_overlapping` is actually a method in the `IntervalIndex` class, so it should be called as `self.is_overlapping()` to execute the method and retrieve the boolean value.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to correct the way `is_overlapping` is accessed within the function. By calling it as a method `self.is_overlapping()`, we can properly obtain the boolean value and handle the logic accordingly.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The corrected version of the function
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By making this correction and updating the function to properly call the `is_overlapping` method, the bug should be fixed and the function should behave as expected in different scenarios.
