### Analysis:
The error message `TypeError: No matching signature found` suggests that there is an issue with the signature of the `get_indexer` method. This error occurs when calling `df.round()` on a DataFrame where the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

### Error Location:
The issue lies in the `get_indexer` method's signature definition.

### Cause of the Bug:
In the buggy code, the signature of the `get_indexer` method specifies `scalar_t[:] target`. This signature does not match the expected parameters, leading to the TypeError. 

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the signature of the `get_indexer` method to match the expected parameters.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    ...
```

By correcting the signature to match the method's usage, the bug should be fixed.
