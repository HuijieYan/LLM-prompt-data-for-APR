### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_indexer` within the `IntervalIndex` class seems to be causing an issue when dealing with `IntervalIndex` objects, specifically related to rounding of columns when using `CategoricalIndex`.
2. The failing test `test_round_interval_category_columns` creates a DataFrame with columns as `CategoricalIndex` based on an `IntervalIndex` and then tries to round the DataFrame, which leads to a failure.
3. The expected behavior is for the rounding to work correctly even when the columns are `CategoricalIndex` based on `IntervalIndex`.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug seems to be in the type handling during rounding of an IntervalIndex with CategoricalIndex columns. A TypeError is raised due to improper handling of the IntervalIndex columns.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug, we need to ensure that the function `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class handles IntervalIndex objects with CategoricalIndex columns correctly during rounding.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # unchanged code here
            pass
        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            # unchanged code here
            pass
        else:
            indexer = []
            for key in target_as_index:
                try:
                    loc = self.get_loc(key)
                except KeyError:
                    loc = -1
                indexer.append(loc)
    
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

By ensuring the correct handling of IntervalIndex objects with CategoricalIndex columns and making necessary adjustments, the corrected code should address the bug and allow the rounding of DataFrame columns with IntervalIndex to work correctly.
