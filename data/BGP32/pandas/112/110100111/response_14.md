### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `get_indexer` inside the `IntervalIndex` class in the `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py` file.
2. The function seems to check for overlapping indices and handle them differently in different scenarios.
3. The failed test `test_round_interval_category_columns` involves creating a DataFrame with an IntervalIndex, using the `round` method, and comparing it with the expected output. The failure seems to relate to handling CategoricalIndex.
4. The bug may lie in the handling of CategoricalIndex created from IntervalIndex, causing a `TypeError` during rounding.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure the correct handling of CategoricalIndex in the `get_indexer` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to be caused by inappropriate handling of CategoricalIndex created from IntervalIndex inside the `get_indexer` function. The current implementation does not handle this scenario correctly, leading to a `TypeError` during rounding. 

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adapt the `get_indexer` function to properly handle CategoricalIndex created from IntervalIndex. This involves ensuring compatibility checks and appropriate indexing based on the involved data types.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = "cannot handle overlapping indices; use IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target_as_index.categories, IntervalIndex):
        target_as_index = target_as_index.categories

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # Adjusted handling for CategoricalIndex

    ...
```

This corrected version includes a check for CategoricalIndex created from IntervalIndex and ensures proper handling for this scenario within the `get_indexer` function. This adjustment should resolve the `TypeError` issue during rounding as reported in the GitHub issue.
