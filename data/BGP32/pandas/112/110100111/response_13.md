### Analysis:
- The buggy function `get_indexer` within the `IntervalIndex` class is responsible for handling indexing operations on IntervalIndex objects.
- The failing test case `test_round_interval_category_columns` tries to round a DataFrame with IntervalIndex columns and encounters an error.
- The expected behavior is that the rounding operation should work as normal for IntervalIndex columns.
- The error seems to be related to the handling of IntervalIndex columns during indexing operations.

### Identified Issue:
- The bug likely stems from how the function `get_indexer` handles IntervalIndex objects and their attributes.
- The error message `TypeError: No matching signature found` indicates that there is an issue with function signature matching.

### Fix Strategy:
- Ensure that the function properly handles IntervalIndex objects and their attributes during the indexing process.
- Check for any type conversion issues or mismatches that might lead to the error during the rounding operation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # Check for compatible IntervalIndex objects
            if self.equals(target_as_index) and self.closed == target_as_index.closed:
                return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        else:
            return Index.get_indexer(self, target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)
```

In the corrected version of the function, we ensure that the function properly handles IntervalIndex objects and checks for compatibility before performing the indexing operation. Additionally, we call the base class Index's `get_indexer` method for non-IntervalIndex cases to maintain consistent behavior.
