### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_indexer` is a method of the `IntervalIndex` class in the `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py` file.
2. The function takes several parameters including `self` (the IntervalIndex instance), `target` (the target array-like index), `method`, `limit`, and `tolerance`. It performs operations based on the type and properties of the `IntervalIndex`.
3. The failing test `test_round_interval_category_columns` creates a DataFrame with columns as a CategoricalIndex of intervals and then attempts to round the DataFrame. The test fails indicating a `TypeError: No matching signature found`.
4. The expected values and types of variables at the return point of the function are provided for a specific test case.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `get_indexer` method in `IntervalIndex` class does not handle operations correctly for `IntervalIndex` columns that are transformed into `pd.CategoricalIndex` columns (as indicated in the failing test). This leads to the TypeError when attempting to round the DataFrame.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to enhance the `get_indexer` method to correctly handle the case where the `target_as_index` is a `pd.CategoricalIndex`, ensuring that proper operations are carried out based on the respective types and properties.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = "cannot handle overlapping indices; use IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # Remaining code as is
    elif isinstance(target_as_index, (CategoricalIndex, IntervalDtype)):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index.codes)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index)
    else:
        # Remaining code as is

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
``` 

In the corrected version, we check if the `target_as_index` is an `IntervalDtype` or a `CategoricalIndex` and handle the operations accordingly, converting to codes if necessary. This approach should resolve the issue and pass the failing test successfully.
