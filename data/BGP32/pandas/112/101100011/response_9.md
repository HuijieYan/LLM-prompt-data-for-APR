The bug in the provided code is within the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class. The bug causes an error when trying to use the `round` method on a DataFrame containing columns that are `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

The issue stems from the `get_indexer` method not properly handling the case when the target index is `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`, leading to a `TypeError` during the `round` operation.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `get_indexer` method to handle this specific case correctly. We should check if the target index is a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex` and adjust the logic accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, pd.CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target_as_index.categories, pd.IntervalIndex):
        target_as_index = target_as_index.categories

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # The remaining logic stays the same
        ...

```

By checking if the `target` is a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` and adjusting the logic accordingly, the `TypeError` issue should be resolved. The corrected version of the `get_indexer` method should now handle `CategoricalIndex` columns created from `IntervalIndex` correctly.

After applying this fix, the provided failing test related to rounding interval category columns should pass successfully.
