### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `get_indexer` within the `IntervalIndex` class.
2. The error message indicates a `TypeError: No matching signature found`, which suggests that the function signature is not compatible with the input parameters provided during the failing test.
3. Based on the input parameters provided during the failing test, the function seems to be expecting a single parameter `target` but might not be handling the input correctly.
4. The failing test expects `target_as_index` to be an `IntervalIndex` object, but the function might not be treating it as such.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `target_as_index` is properly cast to an `IntervalIndex` object.
6. The bug causes a failure in rounding when the columns are of type `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Correctly handle the input `target_as_index` and ensure that it is treated as an `IntervalIndex` object.
2. Make sure that the function can properly handle the provided `target_as_index` values.
3. Address any type discrepancies and ensure that the function can return the expected output.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
    if isinstance(target_as_index, pd.CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target_as_index.categories, pd.IntervalIndex):
        target_as_index = target_as_index.categories  # Handle CategoricalIndex case correctly

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target_as_index)  # Ensure it's treated as an IntervalIndex

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # Rest of the function remains the same
```

### Explanation:
I have added a check to correctly handle the case when `target_as_index` is a `CategoricalIndex` and its categories are of type `IntervalIndex`. In this case, it converts `target_as_index` to the `IntervalIndex` object representing the categories. Then, to ensure that `target_as_index` is always treated as an `IntervalIndex`, it passes through the `ensure_index` conversion.

This correction ensures that the function handles the case of `target_as_index` being a `CategoricalIndex` with categories of type `IntervalIndex`, as expected in the failing test case.
