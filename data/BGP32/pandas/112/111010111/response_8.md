### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_indexer` is a method of the `IntervalIndex` class and is used for retrieving the indexer for the target based on the index type.
2. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect signature of the `get_indexer` function, resulting in a `TypeError` with no matching signature found.
3. The expected input values are instances of `IntervalIndex` for `self` and `target`, which contain interval values and related attributes.
4. The expected output involves manipulation of `target_as_index` based on its data type and matching with `self` to return an indexer.
5. The issue on GitHub indicates a failure specifically when columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`, leading to a `TypeError` with no matching signature found.

### Bug Explanation:
The error occurs when calling the `get_indexer` method because of a mismatch in the signature of the method declaration. The error message "TypeError: No matching signature found" indicates that the provided input types do not match any defined signature for the function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the signature of the `get_indexer` method matches the input parameter types and their expected types. By updating the signature parameter types and ensuring that the operations within the function are consistent with the input types, we can prevent the `TypeError`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    @Substitution(
        **dict(
            _index_doc_kwargs,
            **{
                "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                    """
        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError
            If any method argument other than the default of
            None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
        """
                )
            },
        )
    )
    @Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
    def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:

        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

        # Rest of the function body remains unchanged
```

By fixing the signature of the `get_indexer` method and ensuring appropriate method calls and comparisons, the `TypeError` issue should be resolved, and the function should behave correctly in scenarios like the one described in the GitHub issue.
