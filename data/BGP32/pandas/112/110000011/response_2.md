### Analysis:
The issue mentioned in the GitHub problem is related to the `round()` method failing when the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. This problem arises due to the use of different index types (`IntervalIndex` and `CategoricalIndex`) causing a mismatch in the data types expected by the `round()` method.

### Identified Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is in the `get_indexer()` method of the `IntervalIndex` class where the handling of different types of indexes might lead to the mismatch causing the `round()` method to fail.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused because the `get_indexer()` method is not handling the scenario where the input target is a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`. This mismatch causes the unexpected behavior when applying the `round()` method.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `get_indexer()` method to handle the case where the target index is a `CategoricalIndex` of an `IntervalIndex` more appropriately, ensuring that the expected data types are used when processing the index.

### Corrected Version of the `get_indexer()` method:
The corrected version of the `get_indexer()` method would be as follows:

```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:

        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # Same as original implementation
            
        elif isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex):
            target_as_index = ensure_index(target_as_index.values)
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index)
        
        else:
            # Handle other scenarios as per original implementation
    
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

This corrected version includes a specific handling for `CategoricalIndex` created from `IntervalIndex` by converting it to `IntervalIndex.values` before passing it to the indexer engine.

By making this modification, the `round()` method should work appropriately when columns are a `CategoricalIndex` of an `IntervalIndex`, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
