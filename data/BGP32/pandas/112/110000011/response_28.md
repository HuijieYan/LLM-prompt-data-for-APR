## Analysis:
The buggy function `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class seems to have an issue related to the handling of overlapping indices. This issue might be causing problems when working with `CategoricalIndex` made from `IntervalIndex`, leading to the reported bug on GitHub.

## Error Location:
The error likely occurs in the section where it checks for overlapping indices and tries to match the elements between `left_indexer` and `right_indexer`.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by the handling of overlapping indices in the `get_indexer` function. When encountering overlapping indices, the function raises an `InvalidIndexError`, which can disrupt downstream operations on the data, as reported in the GitHub issue.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To resolve the bug, we need to modify the `get_indexer` function to handle overlapping indices more gracefully, especially when dealing with `CategoricalIndex` created from `IntervalIndex`. Instead of raising an error for overlapping indices, we can adjust the indexing logic to accommodate such scenarios properly.

## Corrected Version:

Here is the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

        # different closed or incompatible subtype -> no matches
        common_subtype = find_common_type(
            [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
        )
        if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

        # For better handling of overlaping indices
        left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer_non_unique(target_as_index.left)
        right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer_non_unique(target_as_index.right)
        indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
        # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In this corrected version, I have replaced the usage of `self.left.get_indexer` and `self.right.get_indexer` with `self.left.get_indexer_non_unique` and `self.right.get_indexer_non_unique` respectively to better handle overlapping indices in `IntervalIndex`.

By making this adjustment, the function should now be able to handle cases where overlapping indices are present, which should resolve the reported bug.
