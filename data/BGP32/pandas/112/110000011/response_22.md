## Identified issues in the buggy function and potential fixes:

1. The buggy function `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class is raising an `InvalidIndexError` when it encounters overlapping indices. This behavior is causing the issue reported on GitHub related to the `round` method failure.
   
2. When `df.round()` is called on a DataFrame with columns derived from a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`, the `round` method fails to match a signature and raises a `TypeError`.

## Bug Cause and Fix Strategy:

The cause of the bug lies in the `get_indexer` function of the `IntervalIndex` class, where overlapping indices are not handled correctly. To fix this issue and resolve the GitHub bug related to `round` method failure, we need to modify the `get_indexer` function to appropriately handle overlapping indices without raising an exception.

### Proposed Fix for the Bug:

Modify the `get_indexer` function in the `IntervalIndex` class to handle overlapping indices by providing a default behavior or a specific logical operation to resolve overlaps.

Here is the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping:
            return self.get_indexer_non_unique(target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)
        else:
            target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
            if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
                # existing logic
            elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
                # existing logic
            else:
                # existing logic
            
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version, when encountering overlapping indices, the `get_indexer` function will call `get_indexer_non_unique` method to handle the overlapping case. This modification should prevent the `InvalidIndexError` from being raised and resolve the issue causing the `TypeError` when using the `round` method on a DataFrame with columns derived from a `CategoricalIndex` of `IntervalIndex`.

By making this adjustment, it ensures a smooth operation of the `round` method in the scenario presented in the GitHub issue.
