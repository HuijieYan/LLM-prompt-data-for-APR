## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_indexer` is supposed to handle different cases based on the type of the `target` parameter, specifically when `target` is an `IntervalIndex`, a scalar index, or a heterogeneous index.
2. The bug seems to be related to the way the `target` parameter is processed when it is an `IntervalIndex`.
3. The function tries to check if the `self` object has overlapping indices, but it doesn't correctly check this condition for the `is_overlapping` attribute.
4. The bug leads to raising an `InvalidIndexError` when trying to handle overlapping indices in an `IntervalIndex`.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the condition checking for `is_overlapping` should be invoked as a method in the `if` statement like `self.is_overlapping()`, instead of accessing it directly as an attribute `self.is_overlapping`. This leads to incorrect handling of overlapping indices and the subsequent raise of the `InvalidIndexError`.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the condition to check `self.is_overlapping()` to correctly check if there are overlapping indices present.
2. The remaining logic in the function seems to be functioning correctly for handling different cases of the `target` parameter.

## Bug-Fixed Version of the Function:
```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():  # Corrected: Calling the method to check for overlapping indices
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the functionality remains unchanged
```

By making the above change, the `get_indexer` function should now correctly handle overlapping indices and avoid raising the `InvalidIndexError` when processing `IntervalIndex` objects. This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure the function operates as expected.
