## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class is failing to handle the case when the target index is `IntervalIndex` with overlapping intervals.
2. The `get_indexer` function is designed to return an indexer array for the target index but fails when encountering overlapping indices.
3. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that this bug causes a `TypeError` when attempting to call the `round` method on a DataFrame with a `CategoricalIndex` of `IntervalIndex`.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the `get_indexer` function in the `IntervalIndex` class does not properly handle cases where the target index (`target_as_index`) is an `IntervalIndex` with overlapping intervals. When attempting to evaluate such cases, the function raises an `InvalidIndexError` instead of handling the overlap condition gracefully, causing the failure reported on GitHub.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, the `get_indexer` function needs to be modified to handle overlapping indices by adjusting the logic to produce valid indexer arrays even in the presence of overlaps. This can be achieved by implementing a strategy to bypass the overlap check or handle overlapping intervals correctly.

## Corrected Version:

```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            common_subtype = find_common_type([self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype])
            if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
                return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    
            left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
            right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
            indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)

        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)

        else:
            indexer = []
            for key in target_as_index:
                try:
                    loc = self.get_loc(key)
                except KeyError:
                    loc = -1
                indexer.append(loc)
    
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

By making the adjustments in the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function, the bug should be fixed, and the function should now handle overlapping indices appropriately, resolving the reported issue on GitHub.
