### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is a method of the `IntervalIndex` class in pandas. It is supposed to handle getting indexers for different types of indexes, especially `IntervalIndex`.
2. The `get_indexer` method is supposed to check if the `self` index overlaps and then handle different cases for matching indexers.
3. The bug is likely in the condition `if self.is_overlapping`. There may be an issue with how the `is_overlapping` property is accessed or evaluated.
4. The expected behavior is to correctly determine the matching indexers for different types of `IntervalIndex` instances based on their properties.

### Bug Explanation:
In the buggy function `get_indexer`, the condition `if self.is_overlapping:` is used to handle overlapping indices. The problem is with how `is_overlapping` is accessed. In the current implementation, `self.is_overlapping` is accessed as a property, which does not evaluate whether the method `is_overlapping` is True or False. Hence, the logic inside the condition does not work as intended leading to the InvalidIndexError being raised even when it might not be necessary.

### Solution Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly evaluate whether `is_overlapping` returns True or False and then execute the logic accordingly. We should ensure that the property `self.is_overlapping` is correctly called to invoke the `is_overlapping` method and handle overlapping indices appropriately.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping():  # Fixed: invoking the is_overlapping method
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
            if self.equals(target_as_index):
                return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
    
            # different closed or incompatible subtype -> no matches
            common_subtype = find_common_type(
                [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
            )
            if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
                return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    
            # non-overlapping -> at most one match per interval in target_as_index
            # want exact matches -> need both left/right to match, so defer to
            # left/right get_indexer, compare elementwise, equality -> match
            left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
            right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
            indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
        else:
            # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
            # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
            indexer = []
            for key in target_as_index:
                try:
                    loc = self.get_loc(key)
                except KeyError:
                    loc = -1
                indexer.append(loc)
    
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
``` 

By updating the buggy function to correctly invoke `self.is_overlapping()` to call the `is_overlapping` method, the behavior should be corrected to handle overlapping indices as intended.
