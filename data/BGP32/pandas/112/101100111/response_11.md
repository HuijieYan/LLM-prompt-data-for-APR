### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `get_indexer` is defined twice in the `IntervalIndex` class in the `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py` file.
2. The function is intended to handle indexing logic for IntervalIndex objects.
3. The function checks if the IntervalIndex object contains overlapping indices and raises an error if it does.
4. It performs operations based on the type of the target object passed to it.
5. The bug in this function seems to be caused by incorrect handling of index types and operations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of the `target` parameter and its conversion to the `target_as_index` variable. The logic within the block for `if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex)` seems to have issues distinguishing between different cases of `target_as_index`. Additionally, the logic for handling `dtype` and `closed` attributes might be incorrect, leading to unexpected outcomes during indexing.

### Proposed Fix:
1. Ensure proper handling of different types of indexes in the `target_as_index` variable.
2. Verify that the `dtype` and `closed` attributes are correctly compared and used in subsequent operations.
3. Improve error handling and messaging for cases where overlapping indices are encountered.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            if self.equals(target_as_index):
                return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
    
            common_subtype = find_common_type(
                [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
            )
            if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
                return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    
            left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
            right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
            indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index)
        else:
            indexer = [self.get_loc(key) if key in self else -1 for key in target_as_index]
    
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

By making the above corrections to the `get_indexer` function, the issues related to incorrect indexing logic and handling of overlapping indices can be resolved. This corrected version should pass the failing test case and resolve the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
