## Analysis:
The buggy function `get_indexer` is supposed to retrieve the index of the target within the IntervalIndex. However, the bug occurs due to the misuse of the `is_overlapping` property when trying to check for overlapping indices.

## Identification of potential error location:
The error occurs in the line `if self.is_overlapping:` where `is_overlapping` should be a method that needs to be called `if self.is_overlapping():` to correctly evaluate its return value.

## Explanation of the bug:
The bug arises because `is_overlapping` is a method in the class, not a property. So, it needs to be called to obtain the result of the check, rather than just referencing it as a property and not properly calling the method. As Python does not raise an error when trying to access a method without calling it, it results in incorrect behavior.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
Call `is_overlapping` method properly by adding parentheses `()` after the method name wherever it's being checked. It will ensure that the method is executed and its return value is considered for the conditional statements.

## Corrected code:
```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping():  # Corrected: Call method to check for overlapping indices
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
            if self.equals(target_as_index):
                return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
    
            # different closed or incompatible subtype -> no matches
            common_subtype = find_common_type(
                [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
            )
            if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
                return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    
            # non-overlapping -> at most one match per interval in target_as_index
            # want exact matches -> need both left/right to match, so defer to
            # left/right get_indexer, compare elementwise, equality -> match
            left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
            right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
            indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
        else:
            # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
            # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
            indexer = []
            for key in target_as_index:
                try:
                    loc = self.get_loc(key)
                except KeyError:
                    loc = -1
                indexer.append(loc)
    
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
``` 

By making the corrected change of calling `self.is_overlapping()` with parentheses, the bug is fixed, and the function should now properly handle checking for overlapping indices within the IntervalIndex.
