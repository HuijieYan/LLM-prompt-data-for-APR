The bug in the provided function lies in the condition `if self.is_overlapping:`. This condition is checking if the method `is_overlapping` exists within the `IntervalIndex` class, but it should be calling the method instead.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the condition `if self.is_overlapping:` does not actually execute the `is_overlapping` method. Instead, it checks if the method object exists, which leads to always evaluating as `True` since the method object itself is always present.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to call the `is_overlapping` method to get its result. This involves changing the condition to `if self.is_overlapping():`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # remaining code unchanged
``` 

In the corrected version above, we call `self.is_overlapping()` to properly execute the method and obtain the intended result. This fixes the bug in the function.
