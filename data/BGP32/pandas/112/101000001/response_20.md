The bug in the provided code is in the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class. The issue lies in the condition check `if self.is_overlapping:`.

The bug is due to the fact that `self.is_overlapping` is not being correctly called as a method to return a boolean value. Instead, `self.is_overlapping` is being treated as a property. In Python, to call a method and obtain its return value, you need to use parentheses. So, the correct way to call the method `is_overlapping` is as `self.is_overlapping()`.

To fix the bug, modify the if statement as follows:
```python
if self.is_overlapping():
```

This change will ensure that `is_overlapping` is invoked as a method to return the expected boolean value.

Here is the corrected version of the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    
    self._check_method(method)
    
    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # remaining code unchanged
```

By fixing the condition check in the `get_indexer` method, the buggy behavior will be resolved.
