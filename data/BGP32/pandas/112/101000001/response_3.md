### Analysis:
The buggy function is overriding the `get_indexer` method in the `IntervalIndex` class. It is intended to return the indexer for the target data against the current index. The buggy function seems to have issues related to the comparison of intervals, handling overlapping indices, and different data types.

### Identified potential error locations:
1. Improper handling of overlapping indices.
2. Incorrect comparisons between intervals causing mismatches.
3. Improper type conversion and handling for specific data types.

### Explanation of the bug:
The buggy function encounters issues with overlapping indices, leading to an exception when encountering overlapping intervals. Incorrect comparisons between left and right boundaries of intervals can also result in mismatches. Improper handling of different data types can lead to unexpected behavior in generating the indexer.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Properly handle overlapping indices by implementing a solution to handle them or raise a specific error with instructions.
2. Ensure correct comparisons between left and right boundaries of intervals for a proper match.
3. Ensure appropriate type conversions and handling for different data types encountered during the indexing process.

### Corrected version of the function:

Here is the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
            if self.equals(target_as_index):
                return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
    
            # different closed or incompatible subtype -> no matches
            common_subtype = find_common_type(
                [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
            )
            if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
                return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    
            # non-overlapping -> at most one match per interval in target_as_index
            # want exact matches -> need both left/right to match, so defer to
            # left/right get_indexer, compare elementwise, equality -> match
            left_indexer = self.left().get_indexer(target_as_index.left())
            right_indexer = self.right().get_indexer(target_as_index.right())
            indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
        else:
            # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
            # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
            indexer = []
            for key in target_as_index:
                try:
                    loc = self.get_loc(key)
                except KeyError:
                    loc = -1
                indexer.append(loc)
    
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In this corrected version, the changes include calling the `is_overlapping()` and other necessary functions with appropriate parentheses, ensuring correct function calls for left and right boundaries, fixing comparisons, and handling data type conversions appropriately based on the defined requirements.
