In the buggy function provided, the main issue is with the condition `if self.is_overlapping`. The intention appears to be to check whether the index overlaps or not, but `is_overlapping` is defined as a method within the same class, not a property or attribute. Hence, the condition `if self.is_overlapping` will always return True because the method itself is considered as truthy.

To fix this bug, we should call the method `is_overlapping()` with appropriate arguments to get the actual result of whether the index overlaps or not.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    
    self._check_method(method)
    
    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use " 
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # Remaining code remains the same
```

In the corrected version, `self.is_overlapping()` is called as a method to get the correct result of whether the index overlaps or not before proceeding with the subsequent logic. This ensures that the condition in the buggy function operates correctly based on the actual result of the method call.

Please incorporate this fix in the buggy function to resolve the issue.
