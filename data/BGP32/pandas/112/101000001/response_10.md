The bug in the provided function `get_indexer` lies in the way it checks for overlaps between IntervalIndex objects. The `get_indexer` function is intended to handle the indexing of IntervalIndex objects, ensuring that the indexes match or converting them appropriately for compatibility. 

The bug arises from the incorrect check for overlapping indices. The current implementation checks for overlap simply by referencing `self.is_overlapping`, which doesn't adequately capture the presence of overlaps in the indexes. 

Here's a strategy for fixing the bug:

1. Replace `self.is_overlapping` with a proper method call that accurately determines if there are overlapping intervals in the index.
2. Override the `is_overlapping` method (not displayed in the provided code) to effectively check for overlaps within the IntervalIndex.
3. Ensure that the replacement accurately captures any overlapping intervals, returning `True` if overlaps exist and `False` otherwise.

Now, let's provide a corrected version of the `get_indexer` function with the suggested fix:

```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:

        self._check_method(method)

        if self._is_overlapping():  # Call to the proper method for checking overlap
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # Remaining code for handling IntervalIndex matching
            # ...
```

With the inclusion of the `_is_overlapping` method that accurately determines overlaps, the `get_indexer` function can now identify and handle this scenario correctly, ensuring proper indexing behavior for IntervalIndex objects. 

Make sure to implement the `_is_overlapping` method within the `IntervalIndex` class to perform the necessary checks for interval overlaps.
