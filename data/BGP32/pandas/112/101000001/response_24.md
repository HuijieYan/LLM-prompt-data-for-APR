## Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function in the `IntervalIndex` class is named `get_indexer`, which is a method that is supposed to return the indexer based on the input target. The goal of this method is to calculate the positional indexer that maps the target array to the current `IntervalIndex`. The method performs several checks and operations based on the type of the target and the properties of the intervals in the Index. The bug in this function seems to be related to the conditions where the method checks for overlapping intervals and decides the matching strategy.

## Potential error locations and bug explanation

The bug can be identified in the following parts of the `get_indexer` function:
1. The conditional statement `if self.is_overlapping:` is incorrect. The function `is_overlapping` should be a method call rather than just a property access.
2. The method fails to handle the case where the `target_as_index` is an IntervalIndex. This leads to potential issues in finding the correct matches or handling different properties for different indexes.
3. The logic for calculating the indexer based on left and right indices seems to be incorrect as it requires both left and right to match for an accurate mapping.

## Suggested bug-fixing strategy

To fix the bug in the `get_indexer` function, follow these steps:
1. Ensure `self.is_overlapping()` is correctly called to check for overlapping intervals.
2. Modify the calculations for different index types (self and target_as_index) to ensure a proper indexing.
3. Debug and refine the logic for finding the correct matches and calculating the indexer.

## Corrected version of the `get_indexer` function

Here is the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function in the `IntervalIndex` class:

                )
            },
        )
    )
    @Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,

    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            if self.equals(target_as_index):
                return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
    
            common_subtype = find_common_type(
                [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
            )
            if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
                return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    
            left_indexer = self.left().get_indexer(target_as_index.left())
            right_indexer = self.right().get_indexer(target_as_index.right())
            indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
        else:
            indexer = []
            for key in target_as_index:
                try:
                    loc = self.get_loc(key)
                except KeyError:
                    loc = -1
                indexer.append(loc)
    
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

By fixing the mentioned issues and refining the logic, this corrected version of the `get_indexer` function should resolve the bug and accurately compute the indexer mapping for the `IntervalIndex`.
