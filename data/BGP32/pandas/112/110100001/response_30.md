## Analysis:
The buggy function `get_indexer` in the `IntervalIndex` class is throwing an error when handling overlapping indices. The error occurs when checking `if self.is_overlapping`. However, there is no implementation provided for handling overlapping indices within this function.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the presence of overlapping indices without appropriate handling in the `get_indexer` function. The function simply raises an `InvalidIndexError` when encountering overlapping indices, without providing a workaround or solution.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to implement a mechanism to handle overlapping indices within the `get_indexer` function. This mechanism should identify and handle overlaps, ensuring that the indexing operation proceeds smoothly without encountering the `InvalidIndexError` due to overlapping indices.

## Corrected Version of the `get_indexer` function:
Here is the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function with added handling for overlapping indices:

```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping:
            return self.get_indexer_non_unique(target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # existing code for handling different index types
            # unchanged
        else:
            # existing code for handling scalar or non-overlapping indices
            # unchanged
    
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

With this corrected version, the function will now call `get_indexer_non_unique` method to handle overlapping indices if `self.is_overlapping`. This will prevent the `InvalidIndexError` from being raised and allow smoother operation when dealing with overlapping indices.
