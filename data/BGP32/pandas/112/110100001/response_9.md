The bug in the `get_indexer` function of the `IntervalIndex` class is related to the handling of the condition where the `target_as_index` is an `IntervalIndex`. The bug causes incorrect indexing behavior when the targeted index is an `IntervalIndex`.

The bug occurs because when comparing two `IntervalIndex` objects, the function incorrectly determines the matching indices by comparing the left and right edges of the intervals individually. This does not account for the fact that intervals may not align perfectly at the boundaries, leading to incorrect matching.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic to appropriately handle the comparison of intervals in case of an `IntervalIndex` target. We need to ensure that the comparison considers the overlap between intervals rather than just matching endpoints.

Here is a corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # Check for potentially overlapping intervals
        overlaps = self.overlaps(target_as_index)

        indexer = np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

        if overlaps:
            for i, interval in enumerate(target_as_index):
                overlaps = self.overlaps(interval)
                if overlaps:
                    matching_intervals = [
                        idx
                        for idx, self_interval in enumerate(self)
                        if self_interval.overlaps(interval)
                    ]
                    if matching_intervals:
                        indexer[i] = matching_intervals[0]

        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)

    if not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
        # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

This corrected version of the function adds a check for overlapping intervals when the target is an `IntervalIndex`. It then iterates over the intervals in the target index and finds matching intervals within the self index by checking for overlaps.

With this fix, the `get_indexer` function should now correctly index intervals even when the target is an `IntervalIndex`. This should resolve the failing test case provided.
