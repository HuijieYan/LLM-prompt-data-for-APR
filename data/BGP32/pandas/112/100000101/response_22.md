The bug in the function is related to how the `target_as_index` variable is handled. This variable is expected to be an `IntervalIndex` object in the input, and the function attempts to extract various attributes and values from it. However, there is a missing conversion step when the `target` parameter is passed as a scalar value.

To fix this issue, we need to add a conversion step to ensure that the `target` parameter is treated as an `IntervalIndex` object even when it is a scalar value. This conversion should align with the expected attributes and values of the `target_as_index` variable.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    if not isinstance(target, IntervalIndex):
        target = IntervalIndex([target], closed='right', dtype='interval[int64]')

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By adding the conversion step to ensure `target` is an `IntervalIndex`, we maintain consistency in handling the attributes and values of `target_as_index`. This correction will ensure that the function performs correctly for both scalar and IntervalIndex input scenarios.
