### Explanation:
- The error occurs when attempting to cast float values to integer values when using the `var` function in a groupby operation.
- The error arises from the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, which is responsible for performing the aggregation operation within groupby calculations.
- The issue arises when the function attempts to cast non-equivalent `float64` values to `int64` using `astype`.
- Due to the non-equivalence of float and integer values, the TypeError is raised, causing the test failure.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the casting from `float64` to `int64` only occurs when the two types are equivalent.
- We need to modify the way casting is handled within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to prevent this error.
- The fix involves ensuring the safe casting of types based on equivalence before conversion.
- Address the incorrect casting issue in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle float to int conversions correctly.

### Bug-Free Implementation:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

        if result is not None:
            result_dtype = np.result_type(result)
            data_dtype = block.dtype

            if result_dtype == data_dtype:
                agg_block = block.make_block(result)
                new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
                agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    items = np.concatenate(new_items)
    return agg_blocks, data.items.take(items)
```

### The updated function ensures that the casting is only performed when the types are equivalent, preventing the TypeError during float to int conversion and fixing the bug.
