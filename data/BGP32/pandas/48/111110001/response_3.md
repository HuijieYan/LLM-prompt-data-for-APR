## Bug Analysis
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the `pandas.core.groupby.generic` module.
2. The function is supposed to aggregate blocks of data based on specific operations.
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError` raised while attempting to safely cast a floating-point array to an integer array when it shouldn't be possible.
4. The error occurs in the intermediate auxiliary function `safe_cast` in the process of the aggregation.

## Bug Location
The error location might be due to an incorrect cast from a float64 dtype to int64 dtype in the method `safe_cast` called in `_cython_agg_blocks`. This issue could be caused by the intermediary steps of the aggregation process, possibly in handling or changing dtype leading to an inconsistency.

## Bug Cause
The error arises because there is an attempt to cast a float64 dtype array into an int64 dtype array using a safe casting method, but the two datatypes are not safely convertible.

## Fix Strategy
We need to ensure that incompatible datatypes are handled appropriately when performing type conversions during the aggregation process. This could involve verifying the data types before performing the casting operation.

## Corrected Code
I'll adjust the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle the type conversion correctly in a safe manner. The updated code adjusts the logic to prevent attempting to cast non-equivalent datatypes.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        except NotImplementedError:
            deleted_items.append(locs)
            continue
        
        if result is no_result:
            continue

        if not isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        indexer = np.array([i for i in indexer if i not in deleted])

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset: offset + loc]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This updated version should resolve the type casting issue when aggregating blocks with mixed datatypes.
