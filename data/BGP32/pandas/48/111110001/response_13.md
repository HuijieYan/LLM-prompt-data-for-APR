### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class which extends the `GroupBy` class.
2. The purpose of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is to aggregate the data blocks based on specified conditions.
3. The error arises when trying to cast a float array to an int64 array, leading to a `TypeError` due to non-equivalent types.

### Bug Cause:
- The error occurs in the `_from_sequence` method call within `_cython_agg_blocks` function. It tries to cast values using the `astype` function, which raises a `TypeError` because the float and int64 types are not equivalent for safe casting.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Check if the result of the aggregation operation is of type float and handle the casting accordingly to prevent the `TypeError`.
- Convert the float dtype to an integer dtype properly while handling the aggregation of blocks.

### Corrected Version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        if block.is_numeric or block.is_float:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result.astype(np.int64))
        else:
            agg_block: Block = block

        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    return agg_blocks, data.items.take(np.concatenate(new_items))
```

### Summary:
The bug was fixed by checking the type of the result during the aggregation operation and properly casting the float array to an int64 array to avoid generating a `TypeError`. With this correction, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should now handle aggregation involving float and integer types correctly.
