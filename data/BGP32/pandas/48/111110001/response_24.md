### Step 1: Analyze the buggy function

- The buggy function is `_cython_agg_blocks` in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class of the `pandas.core.groupby.generic` module.
- The function is part of the implementation of Pandas for aggregation operations.
- The failing test is trying to aggregate data using `mean`, `median`, or `var` functions, but it fails during casting due to the wrong data type.

### Step 2: Identify potential error locations

The error seems to be related to the casting of the identifier `block.values` inside the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. Specifically, the error is happening in the line `result = type(block.values)._from_sequence(...)`. It seems the explicit casting is the source of the issue.

### Step 3: Explain the cause of the bug

The bug occurs because the code is trying to cast `float64` values to `int64`, which is not feasible according to the safe casting rule. This type mismatch leads to a `TypeError` when trying to cast between `float64` and `int64`.

### Step 4: Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the casting is performed correctly, considering the actual types of the data. We should handle cases where the data types are not compatible for casting operations, potentially converting everything to a common data type before casting.

### Step 5: Proposed Fix

Below is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for i, block in enumerate(data.blocks):
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )
        
        if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            result_values = result._data.blocks[0].values
        else:
            result_values = result

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result_values)

        new_items.append(np.array([i], dtype="int"))
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this fix, we directly assign the result values or result DataFrame values to `result_values` based on the result type. This way, the correct values for casting are used. Then, we extract the underlying values to avoid potential type mismatches inside the blocks.
