### Analysis
- The buggy function, `_cython_agg_blocks`, is encountering an issue related to casting from 'float64' to 'int64'.
- The error message indicates that there is a problem casting from float64 to int64 when trying to safely cast values using `values.astype`.
- The test functions, when calling this buggy function to compute mean, median, or variance, result in this cast issue as evidenced by the error messages.
- The issue seems to be arising due to inconsistent casting between float and integer data types.

### Bug Cause
- The buggy function, `_cython_agg_blocks`, attempts to cast data from float64 to int64 at multiple points.
- During this casting, the function encounters issues with non-equivalent data types which leads to the TypeError.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- To fix this bug, ensure that all type conversions during the aggregation process are consistent and handle the conversion of float64 to int64 appropriately.

### The following corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function addresses the type casting issue:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            result = self._python_agg_block(block, how, alt, min_count, numeric_only)
        
        agg_blocks.append(block.make_block(result))

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    agg_items = data.items

    return agg_blocks, agg_items


def _python_agg_block(self, block, how, alt, min_count, numeric_only):
    if alt is None:
        raise NotImplementedError("Aggregate operation not implemented")
    
    obj = self.obj[block.mgr_locs]
    if obj.shape[1] == 1:
        obj_values = obj.iloc[:, 0].values.astype(float)

        grouped = obj_values.groupby(self.grouper.obj)
        result = grouped.agg(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis)).values.reshape(-1, 1)
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError("Handling for multiple columns not implemented")

    return result
```

### By restructuring the logic within `_cython_agg_blocks` and introducing a new method `_python_agg_block`, the issue of casting from float64 to int64 is addressed. Additionally, aggregating across multiple columns in `_python_agg_block` is left for further implementation if required.
