## Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class is supposed to perform aggregation on blocks of data. The function loops through each block, performs the aggregation operation based on the specified `how` method, and creates new aggregated blocks to return.

However, there are a couple of potential error locations in the function:
1. The logic for handling split object-dtype blocks (`split_items`) and split DataFrames (`split_frames`) is not fully implemented, which could lead to incorrect aggregation results.
2. In the loop where aggregation is performed, after handling the case of `NotImplementedError`, the function unnecessarily continues to assert that the result is not a DataFrame, which may not be necessary and could cause issues.
3. There is a potential issue with handling deleted items and adjusting the indexer.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the function arises due to incomplete implementation of handling split object-dtype blocks and DataFrames. The conditional logic for these cases is not fully fleshed out, leading to potential errors in aggregation results.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Complete the implementation of handling split object-dtype blocks and DataFrames to ensure correct aggregation results.
2. Remove unnecessary assertions that check if the result is not a DataFrame.
3. Correctly handle the adjustment of the indexer when there are deleted items.

## Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))

            if len(result._data.blocks) != 1:
                split_items.append(locs)
                split_frames.append(result)
                continue

            result = result._data.blocks[0].values
            if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
                result = result.reshape(1, -1)

        if result is not None:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    for locs, result in zip(split_items, split_frames):
        for i, loc in enumerate(locs):
            new_items.append(np.array([loc], dtype=locs.dtype))
            agg_blocks.append(result.iloc[:, [i]]._data.blocks[0])

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version includes proper handling of split blocks and DataFrames, removes unnecessary assertions, and ensures the adjustment of the indexer is done correctly.
