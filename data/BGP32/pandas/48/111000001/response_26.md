The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is due to the logic for aggregating data blocks based on the `how` parameter. The bug causes incorrect aggregation of data when certain conditions are met, leading to erroneous results or potential failures.

Potential errors:
1. Incorrect handling of the `how` parameter for aggregation.
2. Improper aggregation logic based on data blocks and types.
3. Mismanagement of split blocks and their corresponding results.
4. Incomplete logic for combining aggregated blocks and items.

Cause of the bug:
The bug arises from the inconsistent handling of aggregation operations based on the `how` parameter and the properties of data blocks. This inconsistency can cause unexpected behavior in the aggregation process, especially when dealing with split blocks and alternative aggregation methods.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should be revised to ensure consistent and accurate aggregation of data blocks based on the provided `how` parameter. Proper handling of split blocks, alternative aggregation methods, and combining aggregated blocks and items should be addressed to prevent any potential errors.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
    def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data()
        
        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        agg_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        
        for block in data.blocks:
            try:
                result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
                
            except NotImplementedError:
                if alt is None:
                    # Exclude the block if no alternate method provided
                    deleted_items.append(block.mgr_locs)
                    continue
                
                obj = self.obj[block.mgr_locs]
                if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                    obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]
                
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                try:
                    result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                except TypeError:
                    deleted_items.append(block.mgr_locs)
                    continue
                
                else:
                    agg_block = make_block(result.values, placement=block.mgr_locs, ndim=2)
                    agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
                    agg_items.append(block.mgr_locs)
                    
            else:
                agg_block = make_block(result.values, placement=block.mgr_locs, ndim=2)
                agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
                agg_items.append(block.mgr_locs)
        
        if not agg_blocks:
            raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
        
        if deleted_items:
            # Adjust the indexer to account for removed items
            indexer = np.concatenate(agg_items)
            deleted_idxs = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
            mask = np.zeros(len(data))
            mask[deleted_idxs] = 1
            indexer = (np.arange(len(data)) - mask.cumsum())[indexer]
        
        for i, blk in enumerate(agg_blocks):
            blk.mgr_locs = indexer[blk.mgr_locs]
        
        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, the aggregation process is streamlined to ensure proper handling of data blocks, alternative aggregation methods, and combined results. The logic is simplified to enhance clarity and maintain consistency in the aggregation operations.
