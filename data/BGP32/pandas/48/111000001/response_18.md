The bug in the given function `_cython_agg_blocks` is related to the potential scenarios where the `agg_block` may not get defined before being appended to `agg_blocks`. This can cause a `NameError` due to using `agg_block` without initializing it.

To fix this bug, we should define `agg_block` before the loop in the function and assign it a default value of `None`. This way, even if an exception occurs in the loop and `agg_block` doesn't get defined, the code will not raise an error when trying to append `agg_block` to `agg_blocks`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    agg_block = None  # Define agg_block outside the loop with a default value
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Handling exceptions
    
        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            
            # Other processing
            
            if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                try:
                    result = type(block.values)._from_sequence(
                        result.ravel(), dtype=block.values.dtype
                    )
                except ValueError:
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)
            
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
        
        if agg_block is not None:  # Check if agg_block is defined
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
    
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

In this corrected version, `agg_block` is defined outside the loop and initialized to `None`. It gets assigned a value only when the conditions are met inside the loop. This ensures that `agg_block` is always defined before being used in the subsequent code, preventing any `NameError` due to missing initialization.
