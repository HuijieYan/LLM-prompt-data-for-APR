There are several potential error locations within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:
1. The handling of the `split_items` and `split_frames` lists may lead to unintended behavior if not managed correctly.
2. The transformation of block values and handling of aggregation result data types might result in incorrect results.
3. The indexing and alignment of aggregated blocks and items could introduce errors if not properly handled.

The bug in the function seems to be related to the processing of split blocks and the subsequent alignment of aggregated data. The function is aggregating data blocks based on specified criteria (`how`, `numeric_only`, `min_count`) and encountering issues with blocks that need to be split or combined.

To fix the bug, we need to carefully manage the split blocks and ensure proper alignment and handling of aggregated data. Here is a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1) -> Tuple[List[Block], pd.Index]:
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        if not block.is_numeric:
            continue

        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except (TypeError, DataError):
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            else:
                result = result._data.blocks[0].values  # Unwrap DataFrame

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    if split_items:
        for locs, result in zip(split_items, split_frames):
            for i, loc in enumerate(locs):
                new_items.append(np.array([loc], dtype=locs.dtype))
                agg_blocks.append(result.iloc[:, [i]]._data.blocks[0])

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : offset + loc]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version addresses issues related to split blocks, the handling of aggregation results, and the alignment of aggregated data blocks and items. It ensures that the aggregation process is performed correctly and mitigates potential errors that could arise due to mishandling of data structures.
