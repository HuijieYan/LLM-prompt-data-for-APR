The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class, which is a subclass of `GroupBy`. This function is responsible for performing aggregation operations on the data within the `DataFrameGroupBy` object.

The potential error locations within the function are:
1. Handling of split object-dtype blocks in the `except NotImplementedError` block.
2. Reshaping the result to be valid for non-Extension Block.
3. Adjustment of indexer to account for the items removed.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the handling of split object-dtype blocks and the adjustment of the indexer when items are removed from the data being aggregated. The implementation for split blocks and handling removed items through `deleted_items` may not be done correctly, leading to potential data integrity issues or wrong results.

To fix the bug, you can follow these strategies:
1. Ensure that the split object-dtype blocks are properly processed and the resulting arrays are correctly reshaped.
2. Adjust the indexer properly when items are removed to maintain the correct ordering of items.
3. Verify the calculation of offsets and updating of `mgr_locs` for each aggregated block.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array

        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Handle non-numeric blocks separately
            if alt is not None:
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]].iloc[:, 0]
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                result = result._data.blocks[0].values
                if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)

            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    new_items_array = np.concatenate(new_items)
    sorted_indexer = np.argsort(new_items_array)
    agg_items = data.items.take(sorted_indexer)

    idx_offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = new_items_array[idx_offset: (idx_offset + loc)]
        idx_offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, the processing of split object-dtype blocks and adjusting the indexer should be more robust, ensuring correct aggregation results and maintaining data integrity within the `DataFrameGroupBy`.
