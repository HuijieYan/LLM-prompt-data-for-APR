The bug in the provided function `_cython_agg_blocks` lies in the handling of split blocks when dealing with DataFrame objects. The issue arises when the DataFrame is split into multiple blocks of different types during aggregation, leading to incorrect handling of the split blocks and causing potential errors.

To fix the bug in the function `_cython_agg_blocks`, we need to ensure proper handling of split blocks and concatenate the results from these blocks in a consistent manner. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# This is the corrected version of the buggy function _cython_agg_blocks

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index":
    # Get the data to aggregate
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    # Filter out numeric data if required
    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []  # List to store aggregated blocks
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []  # List to store new items
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []  # List to store deleted items
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []  # List to store split items
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []  # List to store split frames

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            # Attempt to aggregate the block
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                # Exclude the block if operation cannot be performed
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            # Try alternate aggregation method
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            else:
                if result._data.shape[1] != 1:
                    split_items.append(locs)
                    split_frames.append(result)
                    continue

                result = result._data.blocks[0].values
                if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    if split_items:
        for locs, result in zip(split_items, split_frames):
            for i, loc in enumerate(locs):
                new_items.append(np.array([loc], dtype=locs.dtype))
                agg_blocks.append(result.iloc[:, [i]]._data.blocks[0])

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset: offset + loc]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items

```

In the corrected version, I have addressed the handling of split blocks and made sure that the results from split blocks are concatenated properly. This should resolve the bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.
