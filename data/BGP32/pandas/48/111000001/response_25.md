The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks()` is designed to perform aggregation operations on data blocks within a DataFrameGroupBy object. However, there are multiple potential error locations within this function that need to be addressed:

1. The variable `agg_block` is being accessed outside of the scope of the loop where it is defined. This could lead to referencing a variable that has not been assigned in certain cases.
2. The handling of split blocks (split_items and split_frames) is not correctly aligned and could cause issues when aggregating data.
3. The calculation of the `indexer` array and its usage to arrange the aggregated items might lead to incorrect indexing.

To fix these issues, the following corrections can be made to the function:

```python
    def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        split_items: List[List[int]] = []
        split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []
    
        no_result = object()
        for block in data.blocks:
            result = no_result
            locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
            try:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )

            except NotImplementedError as e:
                if alt is None:
                    assert how == "ohlc"
                    deleted_items.append(locs)
                    continue

            if result is not no_result:
                result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
    
                agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
                new_items.append(locs)
                agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
    
        if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
            raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
    
        # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
        indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
        agg_items = data.items.take(np.argsort(indexer))
    
        if deleted_items:
            deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
            ai = np.arange(len(data))
            mask = np.zeros(len(data), dtype=bool)
            mask[deleted] = True
            indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]
    
        offset = 0
        for blk in agg_blocks:
            loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
            blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
            offset += loc
    
        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

With these changes, the `_cython_agg_blocks()` function should now correctly handle the aggregation operations within the DataFrameGroupBy object and prevent potential bugs that were present in the previous version.
