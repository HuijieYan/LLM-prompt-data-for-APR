The bug seems to be related to the handling of split object-dtype blocks in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class.

### Analyzing the Bug:
1. The function tries to handle object-dtype blocks that might be split into `List[Block[T], Block[U]]`.
2. If the result of aggregation is split into multiple blocks, it tries to merge them back into a single block.
3. The issue arises when there are multiple blocks after the split, and the function fails to handle this scenario correctly.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of split object-dtype blocks and merging them back correctly.
2. Managing the result when multiple blocks are created after split.
3. Indexer adjustment when items are removed.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when the function encounters split object-dtype blocks and tries to process them as a single block. It fails to handle the case where multiple blocks are created after the split, leading to incorrect processing and potential errors in indexing and block merging.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check for the case where multiple blocks are created after split and handle each block separately.
2. Ensure proper indexing and merging of blocks based on the individual results.
3. Update the logic for adjusting the indexer when items are removed to maintain consistency.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Process each block separately
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result = no_result

        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            else:
                result = cast(DataFrame, result)

                if len(result._data.blocks) > 1:  # Check for multiple blocks after split
                    for r in result._data.blocks:
                        new_result = r.values.reshape(1, -1)
                        new_items.append(locs)
                        agg_block = block.make_block(new_result)
                        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
                else:
                    result = result._data.blocks[0].values
                    if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
                        result = result.reshape(1, -1)

        assert not isinstance(result, DataFrame)

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[:loc]
        indexer = indexer[loc:]

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version, we handle the scenario where multiple blocks are created after split and ensure that each block is processed correctly before merging them back. Additionally, the logic for adjusting the indexer and managing the aggregation blocks has been updated for correctness.
