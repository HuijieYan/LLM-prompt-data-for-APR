After analyzing the buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks`, it appears that the bug may be related to the aggregation process, especially with handling split blocks and deleted items. The function is responsible for aggregating data based on the specified criteria (`how`) and `numeric_only` flag. The bug causes incorrect aggregation results or potentially raises a `DataError`.

### Potential Error Location:
- Incorrect handling of split blocks and deleted items.
- Incorrect management of `agg_blocks` and `new_items`.
- Unintended reshaping or casting of results.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug could be caused by incorrect handling of split blocks, where assumptions about the input-output block structure may not hold true. Additionally, the handling of deleted items and reshaping the results may lead to unexpected behavior during aggregation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure proper handling of split blocks and deleted items.
2. Verify the correctness of the aggregation results and casting.
3. Implement a structured approach to manage aggregated blocks and data items.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[int] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))

        if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            result = result.values

        if result is not None:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block: Block = Block(result, locs, block.dtypes[0])

            new_items.extend(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, the function focuses on correct aggregation, management of split blocks (if any), and handling deleted items more efficiently. By ensuring proper aggregation and item management, potential errors related to split blocks and deleted items can be mitigated.
