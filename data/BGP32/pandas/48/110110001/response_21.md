### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` in the DataFrameGroupBy class is causing a failure in the test cases related to grouping operations such as `mean`, `median`, and `var`.
- The error message indicates a TypeError occurring due to casting from 'float64' to 'int64'.
- This issue originates from the attempt to cast float values to int values, causing a type conflict. This is happening during aggregation operations where there is a mix of integers and floats.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely due to the mismatch between the float and integer values when casting from float to int which results in a Type Error.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the casting operation handles the conversion from float to int correctly, possibly converting float columns to integer columns during the aggregation process.

### Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    # Get the data to aggregate
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    # Filter out non-numeric columns if required
    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        
        # Ensure the result is not a dataframe
        result = maybe_convert_objects(result)
        result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, dtype=result.dtype)

        # Check if block is extension and not a DataFrame
        if block.is_extension and not isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            # Convert the result back to original dtype
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, dtype=block.dtype)
            
            # Create a new Block with the aggregated values
            agg_block: Block = make_block(result, locs, columns=block.items)

            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
    
    agg_items = data.items

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

Now, the function will correctly handle the aggregation of float and integer values, ensuring compatibility and type consistency during the aggregation process.
