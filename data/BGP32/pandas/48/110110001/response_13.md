### Bug Analysis
- The bug occurs due to an attempt to cast an array from `float64` to `int64` using the `astype` method, which is not possible according to the 'safe' casting rule.
- This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to process the data in the buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks`.
- The failing test is attempting to aggregate data using mean, median, or variance, which requires some casting operations that are failing due to the bug.

### Bug Location
The bug seems to originate from the lines where:
1. `values.astype(dtype, casting="safe", copy=copy)` is called within the `safe_cast` function.
2. `result = type(block.values)._from_sequence` in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, causing casting issues.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the code is trying to cast an array of `float64` values to `int64`, which is not allowed with the 'safe' casting rule. This issue arises when calculating aggregations (mean, median, var) on nullable integer values within `GroupBy` operations.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- We need to adjust the code to ensure that the aggregation functions can handle the casting from float to integer correctly, maintaining suitable floating-point values to prevent these errors.
- We might need to refactor the code to handle the casting operations more elegantly and conditionally based on data types.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                # Filter out operations where computation is not feasible
                if how == "ohlc":
                    continue
    
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                continue
            else:
                result = cast(DataFrame, result)
                if result.shape[1] == 1:
                    result = result.iloc[:, 0]
        
        if how not in ["mean", "median", "var"]:
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result, to=None, copy=False)
    
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    return agg_blocks, data.items
```

### Summary
The corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function provides a more reliable way to handle the casting operations for aggregating values within a `GroupBy` operation, addressing the issue of attempting to cast from float to integer incorrectly. This should resolve the casting errors encountered in the failing tests.
