### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the `generic.py` file of the `pandas` library is causing errors when performing aggregation operations with nullable integer types.
2. The error stems from an attempt to safely cast float64 values to int64, which leads to the type conversion issue.
3. The failing tests for `mean`, `median`, and `var` aggregation operations on nullable integer values trigger the error, as shown by the provided test cases and corresponding error messages.
4. To fix this bug, we need to handle the type casting more appropriately, particularly for nullable integer values, ensuring that the data types are properly managed during aggregation operations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Identify the location in the buggy function where the type casting issue is occurring and update the relevant logic for handling nullable integer types.
2. Implement a safe and appropriate type casting strategy to handle the conversion from float64 to int64 effectively.
3. Ensure that the corrected function can pass the failing test cases for `mean`, `median`, and `var` aggregation operations on nullable integer values.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Handling non-numeric aggregation methods
            deleted_items.append(locs)
            continue

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    return agg_blocks, data.items
```

This updated version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should address the type casting issue involved in aggregating nullable integer values and allow it to pass the failing tests for the specified aggregation operations.
