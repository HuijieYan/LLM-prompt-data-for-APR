### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs when the DataFrameGroupBy class attempts to perform aggregation operations on nullable integer columns. When the dtype of the columns involved in the operation is Int64 or nullable integer, issues arise during the casting of the data. This leads to a `TypeError: Cannot cast array from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') according to the rule 'safe'`.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the `_cython_agg_blocks` method of the DataFrameGroupBy class in the generic.py file.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the code failing to handle nullable integer data types appropriately when performing aggregation operations that involve casting data.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the data is properly cast when performing aggregation operations. Specifically, the handling of nullable integer data types during the aggregation process needs to be improved.

### Updated and Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` method:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj.take(locs, axis=1)
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            else:
                if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
                    result = result.values
                    if result.ndim == 1:
                        result = result.reshape(1, -1)

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result, try_float=False)

            if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                result = result.ravel()  # Convert to 1D array

            agg_block = make_block(result, block_placement=block.mgr_locs)

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    return agg_blocks, data.items.take(np.concatenate(new_items))
```

By updating the casting operations and ensuring proper handling of nullable integer values, this corrected `_cython_agg_blocks` method should resolve the issue with the aggregation of nullable integer columns.
