### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` inside the `DataFrameGroupBy` class is failing to handle the aggregation of nullable integer data, leading to a TypeError when trying to safely cast float64 to int64.
2. The error arises from the attempt to convert float64 to int64, which is not possible while maintaining 'safe' casting rules.
3. The error message explicitly states the failure with the specific data types involved, indicating a casting issue with float64 to int64.
4. To fix the bug, we should ensure that numeric values, including nullable integers, are cast correctly to avoid incompatible type conversions.

### Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
    def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        
        no_result = object()

        for block in data.blocks:
            result = no_result
            locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array

            try:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
            except NotImplementedError:
                if alt is None:
                    assert how == "ohlc"
                    deleted_items.append(locs)
                    continue
                
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                
                try:
                    # Handle float64 to int64 safely
                    result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis)).astype(block.dtype)
                except TypeError:
                    deleted_items.append(locs)
                    continue

                block = block.make_block(result)
                
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(block)

        if not (agg_blocks):
            raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

        # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
        indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
        agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

        # we need to adjust the indexer to account for the items we have removed
        if deleted_items:
            deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
            ai = np.arange(len(data))
            mask = np.zeros(len(data))
            mask[deleted] = 1
            indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

        offset = 0
        for blk in agg_blocks:
            loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
            blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : offset + loc]
            offset += loc

        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This fix involves:
- Adding a new way to cast the values to the expected block dtype while handling the TypeError during aggregation.
- Ensuring that the data type conversion from float64 to int64 is performed safely in the aggregation process.
- Correcting the handling of deleted items and indexer adjustment for alignment.

By updating the `_cython_agg_blocks` function as shown above, the TypeError during aggregation when casting float64 to int64 should be resolved, allowing the corrected version to pass the failing test cases.
