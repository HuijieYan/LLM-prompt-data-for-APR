### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in pandas.
2. The test function `test_apply_to_nullable_integer_returns_float` is used to test the behavior of the pandas groupby functionality.
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError` caused by attempting to cast a `float64` array to an `int64` array, which is not allowed.
4. The bug seems to originate from how floating-point numbers are handled within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function during aggregation tasks.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function `_cython_agg_blocks` trying to cast non-equivalent `float64` arrays to `int64`, resulting in a `TypeError`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles casting from floating-point arrays to integer arrays properly. This can involve using appropriate type conversions or specifying a fallback mechanism when incompatible types are encountered.

### Solution:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
from pandas.core.internals.managers import make_block
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import ensure_float64
from pandas.core.blocks.numpy import DatetimeBlock, ClassBlock

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            # Handle conversion from float64 to int64
            casted = ensure_float64(result)
            agg_block = make_block(casted)
        else:
            if not isinstance(result, DataFrame):
                casted = ensure_float64(result)
                agg_block = make_block(casted)
        
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    return agg_blocks, data.items
```

By ensuring type compatibility during aggregation and properly casting the values to the desired types, this corrected version should fix the type casting issue encountered in the initial function.
