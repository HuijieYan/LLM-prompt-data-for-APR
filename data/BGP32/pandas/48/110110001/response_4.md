### Bug Analysis
- The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is a method inside the `DataFrameGroupBy` class, inheriting from the `GroupBy` class in the pandas library.
- The error reported in the failing test is a `TypeError` caused by attempting to cast non-equivalent data types, specifically trying to cast float64 to int64.
- The error occurs when converting values from float to integer during grouping or aggregation operations.

### Bug Location
1. The error occurs when trying to enforce datatypes during aggregation in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.
2. The conversion from float64 to int64 triggers the `TypeError` due to non-equivalent data types.

### Bug Explanation
- The bug arises from improper datatype handling, trying to cast float64 values to int64 during aggregation operations.
- The error message indicates that the cast between data types float64 and int64 is not feasible according to the safe rules of dtype casting.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- To resolve the issue, we need to ensure proper datatype handling, considering the specific dtype requirements during aggregation operations.
- We should handle cases where floating-point data needs to be converted to integer data, ensuring compatibility.

### The Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Handle exceptions or unsupported operations
            if alt is None:
                # Exclude the block if the operation is not feasible
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            # Perform alternate operation on the block
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))._data.blocks[0].values
            if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
                result = result.reshape(1, -1)

        # Process the result and cast appropriately
        if result is not no_result:
            # Perform the appropriate data type casting
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result, copy=False)
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No valid data types to aggregate")

    # Update block locations and items
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    # Adjust indices if items are deleted
    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    # Update block locations to match sorted indices
    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

### Correction Rationale
- The correction involves:
  - Handling data type conversion using `maybe_convert_objects` and `maybe_downcast_numeric` functions.
  - Ensuring proper datatype treatment during aggregation operations, avoiding cast errors.
- The corrected function maintains the original functionality while addressing the `TypeError` issues related to datatype casting.
