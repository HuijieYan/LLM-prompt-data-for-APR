### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs when trying to cast an array of `float64` dtype to `int64`, causing a `TypeError`. This issue arises from using `int64` dtype as the intended dtype instead of the original `float64` dtype. The failure happens when attempting to cast the aggregation results to the original datatype, leading to an impasse.

### Bug Location:
The issue is likely arising from the `_from_sequence` method in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, specifically the attempt to cast the array back to the original dtype.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by using the target dtype of the operation instead of the original dtype. When attempting to cast the array of the aggregate result back to the original datatype, it is explicitly trying to cast the dtype to `int64` instead of maintaining the original `float64` dtype.

### Proposed Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when casting the aggregated result back to the original datatype, we take into consideration the original dtype of the array. We should maintain the original dtype of the elements to prevent casting errors from differing data types.

### Corrected Code:
Below is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Python aggregation when the operation is not supported
            # continue with alternate method if available
            if alt is None:
                raise NotImplementedError("Alternate method not specified")
            else:
                result = block.values.groupby(self.grouper.axis).transform(alt)
        
        if result is not no_result:
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result, copy_data=False)

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
    
    # Combine the aggregated blocks into a final structured output
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))
    
    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By utilizing the `groupby` method supported by Pandas to transform the block values instead of directly manipulating and casting the data, we can ensure that the original datatype is preserved in the aggregation process.
