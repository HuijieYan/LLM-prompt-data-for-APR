### Analysis
- The code contains a function `_cython_agg_blocks` within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class that is expected to perform aggregation for group-by operations.
- The error message from the failing test indicates a `TypeError` when trying to convert a `dtype('float64')` to `dtype('int64')` using `astype`.
- The failing test occurs when attempting to perform aggregation operations like `mean`, `median`, or `var` on integer data in the groupby object.


### Bug Location
- The error seems to be in the `safe_cast` function, which is part of the `_cython_agg_blocks` logic.
- The problem arises when trying to cast non-equivalent data types, specifically `float64` to `int64`, which causes a `TypeError`.

### Bug Cause
- The bug occurs because the code does not account for safe casting operations between different data types.
- The failing tests trigger the error when trying to cast `float64` values to `int64` within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class for groupby aggregation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure safe casting between different data types by handling the conversion appropriately.
- We should update the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to address the safe casting issue and avoid the specific `TypeError` encountered during aggregation operations.

### Updated Function
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        if result is not None:
            cast_dtype = np.float64 if result.dtype.kind == 'f' else result.dtype
            result = result.astype(cast_dtype)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate([block.mgr_locs.as_array for block in agg_blocks])
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    for i, blk in enumerate(agg_blocks):
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[len(blk.mgr_locs) * i:len(blk.mgr_locs) * (i + 1)]

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

### Suggestions
- The updated function casts the resulting data to the appropriate dtype for safe conversion.
- We recommend testing the corrected function against the failing test scenarios to verify if the bug has been resolved.
