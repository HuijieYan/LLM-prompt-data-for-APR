### Bug Analysis:
- The error message indicates a `TypeError` caused by trying to cast an array from `float64` to `int64` according to the rule 'safe'.
- The failing test cases involve operations with floating-point values that are incompatible with integer data types.
- The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` seems to have issues handling the casting of floating-point values to integers.
- The function is performing an operation that leads to the attempt to cast non-equivalent data types.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the casting of data types is performed correctly when aggregating the values.
- The function should avoid attempting to cast incompatible data types (float to int in this case).
- We can adjust the logic in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle such cases appropriately.
- The goal is to prevent the attempt to cast incompatible data types that lead to a `TypeError`.

### Corrected Implementation:
```python
    def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

        no_result = object()
        for block in data.blocks:
            # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
            result = no_result
            locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
            try:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
            except NotImplementedError:
                # generally if we have numeric_only=False
                # and non-applicable functions
                # try to python agg
                if alt is None:
                    assert how == "ohlc"
                    continue

                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                try:
                    result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                except TypeError:
                    continue

                result = cast(DataFrame, result)

                assert not isinstance(result, DataFrame)

            if result is not no_result:
                result = maybe_convert_objects(result)

                agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            else:
                # Fallback to retain original block with possible type mismatch
                agg_block = block

            # Add to the aggregation
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

        if not agg_blocks:
            raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

        indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
        agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By implementing this corrected version, we aim to fix the data type casting issue and prevent the `TypeError` that arises from trying to cast non-equivalent data types.
