### Analysis:
The error occurs when trying to cast a float64 array to an int64 array, resulting in a `TypeError`. This error is triggered when calling methods like `mean`, `median`, or `var` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` dtype. The issue reported on GitHub clearly describes the problem and the expected behavior.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug arises in the `_cython_agg_blocks` method where the casting of values to a different dtype is not handled correctly. The error message indicates that the explicit casting of a float64 array to an int64 array using `values.astype(dtype)` fails.

### Fix Strategy:
To resolve this issue, we need to ensure that the casting operation from float64 to int64 is handled correctly. This can be achieved by modifying the code within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to appropriately handle the dtype conversion logic.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # generally if we have numeric_only=False
            # and non-applicable functions
            # try to python agg
            if alt is None:
                # we cannot perform the operation
                # in an alternate way, exclude the block
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                # Avoid call to self.values that can occur in DataFrame
                #  reductions; see GH#28949
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                # we may have an exception in trying to aggregate
                # continue and exclude the block
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            else:
                result = cast(DataFrame, result)
                new_items.append(locs)
                result = result._data.blocks[0].values

        assert not isinstance(result, DataFrame)

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result, dtype=block.dtype)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our
    # current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

### Next Steps:
1. Replace the existing `_cython_agg_blocks` function in the pandas codebase with the corrected version.
2. Test the modified function to ensure that the casting issue has been resolved.
3. Close the GitHub issue referencing that the bug has been fixed.
