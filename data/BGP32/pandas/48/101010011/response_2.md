### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates a TypeError related to casting from `float64` to `int64` while trying to perform an aggregation operation like mean, median, or var.
2. The error occurs in the `safe_cast` function, specifically when trying to convert `float64` values to `int64`.
3. The issue on GitHub highlights the problem when calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy object with Int64 dtype.
4. The issue arises due to the data type conversion issue while performing aggregation operations on a DataFrameGroupBy object with nullable integer type.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to an improper data type conversion attempt from `float64` to `int64` in the `safe_cast` function. This issue arises when trying to aggregate data with nullable integer type, leading to a TypeError.

### Fix Strategy:
To address this bug, we need to ensure correct data type handling during aggregation operations on DataFrameGroupBy objects with nullable integer type. Specifically, making sure that incompatible data types are handled appropriately during type conversion.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to resolve the type conversion issue:

```python
def safe_cast(values, dtype, copy: bool):
    """
    Safely cast the values to the dtype if they
    are equivalent, meaning floats must be equivalent to the
    ints.
    """
    try:
        return values.astype(dtype, copy=copy)
    except TypeError as err:
        casted = values.view(np.float64).astype(dtype, copy=copy)
        if np.array_equal(values, casted):
            return casted
        raise TypeError(
            f"cannot safely cast non-equivalent {values.dtype} to {np.dtype(dtype)}"
        ) from None

def _cython_agg_blocks(self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    # Some object-dtype blocks might be split into List[Block[T], Block[U]]
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Error handling logic can remain as it is

        # Remaining logic remains the same

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version ensures proper handling of data type conversion in the `safe_cast` function and resolves the casting issue from `float64` to `int64` during aggregation operations.
