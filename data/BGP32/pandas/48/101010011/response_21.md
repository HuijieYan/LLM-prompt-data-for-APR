### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is responsible for the error message related to the casting of `float64` to `int64`.
- The error occurs when trying to cast the values to a certain dtype and the conversion is not possible due to non-equivalent types.
- The `safe_cast` function is called in `_cython_agg_blocks` to handle casting, and the error arises from incompatible conversions between float and int types.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by attempting to perform a safe cast from `float64` to `int64`, which is not allowed due to non-equivalent types.
- The `_cython_agg_blocks` function processes data blocks and attempts to perform type conversions when necessary, leading to the error.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Check for cases where float values are being mistakenly cast to int values.
- Implement a solution to handle the safe casting of non-equivalent types.
- Adjust the type conversion logic in `_cython_agg_blocks` to handle float to int conversion cases properly.

### Bug Fix:

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            ...
        
        # Handle safe cast for non-equivalent types
        if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and np.issubdtype(result.dtype, np.floating) and np.issubdtype(block.dtype, np.integer):
            result = result.astype(block.dtype, casting="unsafe")
        
        if result is not no_result:
            # skip the cast logic

        ...
```

By adding a specific condition to handle the safe cast of float to int types, we can address the TypeError issue related to non-equivalent types in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.
