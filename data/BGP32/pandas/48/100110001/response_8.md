### Analysis:
The function `_cython_agg_blocks` is encountering an issue when trying to safely cast float64 to int64 while aggregating data with certain functions like `var`. This error occurs due to the data type mismatch, where the original data is of type float64 and the casting is trying to convert it to int64, which is not allowed according to the 'safe' casting rule. This results in a `TypeError`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by an attempted safe cast from float64 to int64 in the function `_cython_agg_blocks`, leading to a `TypeError` as the conversion violates the 'safe' casting rule. This problematic cast occurs during the aggregation of data with incompatible types.

### Solution Strategy:
To address this issue, we need to ensure that the casting from float64 to int64 is handled appropriately. One way to tackle this is by converting the resulting values to a suitable datatype that accommodates float64 data. In this case, we can convert the aggregated data to float64 to resolve the casting error.

### Corrected Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Handle aggregation errors
            continue

        if result is not no_result:
            # Cast the block values to float64 to handle cast safely
            result = result.astype(float)

            # Create a Block from the resulting values
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By updating the function to convert the aggregated result to float and handling the error-prone cast properly, we aim at resolving the TypeError resulting from the attempted float64 to int64 conversion during the aggregation process.
