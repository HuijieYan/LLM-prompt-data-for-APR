### Analysis
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is encountering issues when trying to cast float values to integer values in the `safe_cast` function. This is leading to a `TypeError` where it tries to cast non-equivalent float64 values to int64. The error occurs when the function `_cython_agg_blocks` processes the results of the aggregation operation for specific functions like `mean`, `median`, and `var`. The function is failing to handle the conversion of float values to integer values during aggregation.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the function `_cython_agg_blocks` attempting to cast values between incompatible types (`float64` to `int64`) during the aggregation process. This leads to a `TypeError` in the `safe_cast` function, as the conversion is not feasible due to the non-equivalence of the types. This causes an inconsistency in the data types, resulting in an error during the execution of aggregation operations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function `_cython_agg_blocks` can handle the conversion of float values to integer values properly during aggregation operations. This can be achieved by modifying the casting logic in a way that it deals with incompatible data types gracefully, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function that addresses the casting issue:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            else:
                result = cast(DataFrame, result)
                
                if len(result._data.blocks) != 1:
                    deleted_items.append(locs)
                    continue

                assert len(result._data.blocks) == 1
                result = result._data.blocks[0].values
                if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)

        assert not isinstance(result, DataFrame)

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            
            if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                assert result.ndim == 1 or result.shape[0] == 1
                try:
                    result = type(block.values)._from_sequence(
                        result.ravel(), dtype=block.values.dtype
                    )
                except ValueError:
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))
    
    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version addresses the casting issue by ensuring that the conversion of float values to integer values is handled appropriately during aggregation operations, preventing the `TypeError` that occurred in the failing tests.
