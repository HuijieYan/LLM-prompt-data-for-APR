### Analysis
The error message indicates a problem related to casting from 'float64' to 'int64' when applying certain aggregation functions to nullable integer data. This suggests an issue with type conversion within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

### Bug Identification
Looking at the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, the issue potentially arises from the block-level aggregation operations performed within the function. Specifically, there is a part that tries to cast the block back to the original dtype in certain cases. This can lead to a conflict between the original dtype and the dtype obtained after the aggregation operations.

### Bug Explanation
The bug is caused by how casting is handled within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. When `maybe_downcast_numeric` function is used to potentially downcast block values to the original dtype, it may conflict with the type of the values obtained after the aggregation operation, leading to a casting error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, it is crucial to ensure that any type conversions or casting operations maintain data consistency throughout the aggregation process. Specifically, reviewing the type handling logic where the original dtype is considered could help address this issue.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result = no_result

        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Handle aggregation operation errors
            deleted_items.append(locs)
            continue

        if result is not no_result and not isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            # Handle cast back to original dtype
            result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, block.dtype)
            
            # Create an aggregation block
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Update locs in the blocks
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        # Adjust indexer for removed items
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (np.arange(len(data)) - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By ensuring proper type consistency and handling throughout the aggregation process, this corrected function should resolve the casting error encountered during the failing test scenarios.
