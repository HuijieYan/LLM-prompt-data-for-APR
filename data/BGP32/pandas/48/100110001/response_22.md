### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is attempting to perform aggregate operations on data blocks but encounters an error when trying to cast float values to an integer array. This issue arises when attempting aggregation functions that result in float values, and the function expects the result to be stored as integers.

The error message points to the failure of safely casting float64 values to int64, which is not allowed according to the 'safe' casting rule.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function handles the casting of float values to integers correctly when necessary. The bug occurs in the aggregation process when trying to cast the output to an integer array. We need to modify the affected part of the code to correctly handle float values by safely converting them to integers as needed.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result, changed = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        
        if changed:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
        
        agg_block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

### Updated Function Explanation:
1. The modified function now directly aggregates the data blocks using the grouper and checks if the output requires downcasting.
2. If downcasting is necessary, it uses the `maybe_downcast_numeric` function to safely convert the result to integer type when needed.
3. The function then builds the aggregated blocks and items for the final result.
4. The bug related to improper casting of float values to integers has been addressed in this corrected version. 

After applying the fix, the function should be able to handle aggregation operations properly without throwing errors related to datatype conversions.
