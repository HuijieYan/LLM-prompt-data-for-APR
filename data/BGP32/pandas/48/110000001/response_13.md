The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the `generic.py` file of the pandas library appears to have several potential error locations:

1. In the `except NotImplementedError` block where `assert how == "ohlc"` is checking the value of the `how` parameter, which might not be the appropriate condition to assert.
2. The logic related to handling split blocks in the `else` block after catching the `TypeError`.
3. The condition `if deleted_items` in the following code segment:
    ```python
    if deleted_items:
        # code logic to adjust indexer
    ```
    needs further verification as it might not work as intended.

To address these issues and improve the function's overall functionality and reliability, we should consider the following steps to fix the bug:

1. Review and redefine the conditions and logic inside the `except NotImplementedError` block to handle alternative methods effectively.
2. Refine the handling of split blocks in the `else` block to ensure all edge cases are correctly managed.
3. Revalidate the logic for adjusting the `indexer` when `deleted_items` are present to account for removed items accurately.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
    def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
        # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine
    
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []
    
        no_result = object()
        for block in data.blocks:
            result = no_result
            locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
            try:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
            except NotImplementedError:
                if alt is None:
                    deleted_items.append(locs)
                    continue
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                    obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                try:
                    result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                except TypeError:
                    deleted_items.append(locs)
                    continue
            if result is not no_result:
                result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
                agg_block = block.make_block(result)
    
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
    
        if not agg_blocks:
            raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
    
        if split_items:
            for locs, result in zip(split_items, split_frames):
                for i, loc in enumerate(locs):
                    new_items.append(np.array([loc], dtype=locs.dtype))
                    agg_blocks.append(result.iloc[:, [i]]._data.blocks[0])
    
        indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
        agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))
    
        if deleted_items:
            deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
            ai = np.arange(len(data))
            mask = np.zeros(len(data))
            mask[deleted] = 1
            indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]
    
        offset = 0
        for blk in agg_blocks:
            loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
            blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
            offset += loc
    
        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

These adjustments aim to enhance the function's robustness and correct the potential errors identified within the original implementation.
