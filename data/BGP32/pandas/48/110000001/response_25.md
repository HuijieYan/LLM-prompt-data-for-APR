The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is a method of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the `pandas` library. This function is responsible for performing aggregation operations on the data within the groupby object.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. Handling of split object-dtype blocks into `List[Block[T], Block[U]]`.
2. Incorrect handling of exceptions raised during aggregation.
3. Incorrect processing of DataFrame results in the aggregation operation.
4. Inadequate error handling for cases where there are no numeric types to aggregate.

The bug in the function arises from the inconsistent handling of different types of data blocks and the inconsistent treatment of exceptions during aggregation. The function may encounter errors when processing object-dtype blocks and DataFrame results in the aggregation step.

One strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure consistent handling of different data types and improve error handling during aggregation operations. Specifically, the function should properly deal with split object-dtype blocks, handle exceptions during aggregation more gracefully, and provide better error messages when there are no numeric types to aggregate.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
        for block in data.blocks:
            locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
            try:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
            except NotImplementedError:
                if alt is None:
                    deleted_items.append(locs)
                    continue
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                try:
                    result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                except TypeError:
                    deleted_items.append(locs)
                    continue
                else:
                    result = cast(DataFrame, result)
                    result = result.iloc[:, 0].values.reshape(1, -1) if result.shape[1] == 1 else result.values
    
            if not isinstance(result, DataFrame):
                result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype) if not block.is_extension else maybe_convert_objects(result)
    
                agg_blocks.append(block.make_block(result))
                new_items.append(locs)
    
        if not agg_blocks:
            raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
    
        indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
        agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))
    
        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, the function addresses the handling of different data types more consistently and improves the error handling mechanisms. It also provides a clearer error message when there are no numeric types to aggregate.
