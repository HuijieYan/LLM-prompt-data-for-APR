After analyzing the given buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks`, it seems that the potential error locations lie in the sections where the function is handling the aggregation process for blocks of data. The bug most likely arises from incorrect indexing or handling of blocks during the aggregation process.

The cause of the bug could be related to the incorrect alignment between the aggregated results and the corresponding blocks of data. This could result in mismatched shapes or incorrect indexing, leading to errors or unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug in the function `_cython_agg_blocks`, we need to ensure that the aggregation results are properly aligned with the corresponding blocks and that the indexing operations are performed correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], List[Axis]]:
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs
        try:
            result = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
            result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block: Block = make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
        except NotImplementedError:
            deleted_items.append(locs)

    # Check if there are valid numeric types to aggregate
    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No valid numeric types to aggregate")

    # Updating the locations of the aggregated blocks
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    offset = 0
    for i, blk in enumerate(agg_blocks):
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : offset + loc]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that the aggregation results are properly appended to the `agg_blocks` list with the corresponding indexes. Also, we handle the case where there are no valid numeric types to aggregate by raising a `DataError` exception.

This corrected version should address the potential bug related to the aggregation alignment and incorrect indexing within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.
