## Analysis:
The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function lies in the logic for handling split items within the loop. When a DataFrame block is split into separate blocks, the function tries to concatenate the split items with the remaining aggregated blocks, which leads to incorrect indices and mismatched shapes.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when handling a DataFrame block that is split into multiple blocks due to the application of certain functions. This results in incorrect aggregation and indexing, leading to the wrong output.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the split items correctly and ensure that the indices and shapes are consistent throughout the aggregation process. By adjusting the logic for dealing with split items and maintaining proper indexing, we can prevent the bug from occurring.

## Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
    
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                # exclude the block if alternate method is not available
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(block.mgr_locs)
                continue

            s = get_groupby(self.obj[(data.items == block.mgr_locs)], self.grouper)
            result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result, try_float=True)
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
    
            agg_block: Block = make_block(result, placement=block.mgr_locs)
            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    if deleted_items:
        deleted_items = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        original_locs = data.items

        indexer = np.arange(len(original_locs))

        mask = np.in1d(indexer, deleted_items)
        indexer = indexer[~mask]

        for blk in agg_blocks:
            blk.mgr_locs = indexer

    agg_items = data.items.take(np.concatenate(new_items))
    
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version, I adjusted the logic for handling split items, ensured proper indexing throughout the aggregation process, and improved the error handling for unavailable alternate methods. This should prevent the bug from occurring and ensure correct aggregation of DataFrame blocks.
