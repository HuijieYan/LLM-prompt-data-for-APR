### Analysis:
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is used in a class `DataFrameGroupBy` which inherits from `GroupBy`. The function is responsible for performing aggregation operations on blocks of data based on the specified aggregation method.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The use of `agg_block` without initializing it within the loop.
2. Handling of split items and frames may cause issues in the aggregation results.
3. Adjusting the locs in the blocks based on the current ordering.
4. Handling of deleted items and adjusting the indexer accordingly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the function is related to handling split items, deleted items, and adjusting the block locs. The code does not properly handle split items and may not adjust the locs of blocks correctly which can lead to incorrect aggregation results or errors during the process.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Initialize `agg_block` within the loop where it is used.
2. Ensure proper handling of split items and frames to maintain aggregation consistency.
3. Carefully adjust the locs in the blocks based on the correct ordering.
4. Update the indexer to account for the items that have been removed during aggregation.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
from pandas.core.indexes.base import Index

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []
    
    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
    
        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
    
            if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                assert result.ndim == 1 or result.shape[0] == 1
                try:
                    result = type(block.values)._from_sequence(
                        result.ravel(), dtype=block.values.dtype
                    )
                except ValueError:
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)
    
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
    
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
    
    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
    
    if split_items:
        for locs, result in zip(split_items, split_frames):
            assert len(locs) == result.shape[1]
            for i, loc in enumerate(locs):
                new_items.append(np.array([loc], dtype=locs.dtype))
                agg_blocks.append(result.iloc[:, [i]]._data.blocks[0])
    
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))
    
    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc
    
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version, the handling of `agg_block`, split items, deleted items, and adjusting locs has been improved to address the potential issues in the original function.
