- Bug Analysis:
  - The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is related to the handling of split items when splitting object-dtype blocks into `List[Block[T], Block[U]]`. The function is not correctly managing these split items, causing issues with the aggregation process.

- Potential Error Locations:
  - Handling of split items and split frames.
  - Updating the index and aggregation blocks based on split items.

- Bug Explanation:
  - The bug occurs when splitting object-dtype blocks into multiple blocks (`List[Block[T], Block[U]]`). The function fails to correctly manage these split items by not properly updating the index and aggregation blocks based on the split frames, leading to incorrect aggregation results.

- Bug Fix Strategy:
  - Ensure that split items and frames are properly handled by updating the index, aggregation blocks, and managing the split frames correctly to reflect the split data accurately.

- Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            try:
                alt_result = obj.agg(alt)
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            split_frames.append(alt_result)
            split_items.append(locs)
            continue

        result = maybe_convert_objects(block, result, fastpath=True)
        agg_block = make_block(result, placement=block.mgr_locs)

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    for idx, (locs, result) in enumerate(zip(split_items, split_frames)):
        split_len = len(locs)
        new_locs = np.arange(data.shape[0], data.shape[0] + split_len)
        split_block = make_block(result.values, placement=BlockPlacement(index=new_locs))
        new_items.append(new_locs)
        agg_blocks.append(split_block)

    data._set_result_index(np.concatenate(new_items))

    return agg_blocks, data.items
```

In this corrected version, I have made modifications to ensure split items and frames are handled properly during the aggregation process. Split frames are created and added to the aggregation blocks while updating the index to reflect the split data accurately.
