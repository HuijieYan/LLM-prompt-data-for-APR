## Analysis:
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` within the class `DataFrameGroupBy` is designed to aggregate data within a DataFrameGroupBy object. The bug within this function seems to be related to the handling of split object-dtype blocks, which leads to incorrect processing and potential errors during aggregation.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of split object-dtype blocks.
2. Incorrect aggregation logic causing unexpected results.
3. Error handling for certain exceptions within the aggregation process.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug likely arises when the function encounters split object-dtype blocks resulting from the aggregation process, which leads to incorrect assumptions about the data structure and can cause errors during processing or result in inaccurate aggregated values.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Correctly handle split object-dtype blocks by ensuring that the code accommodates this scenario.
2. Improve error handling to address exceptions that may occur during aggregation.
3. Verify the aggregation logic to ensure the correct computation and handling of aggregated values.

## Corrected Version:

```python

    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:

            except (TypeError, ValueError):
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
        
        if not isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                try:

                        result.ravel(), dtype=block.values.dtype
                    )
                except ValueError:
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)
    
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
    
    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reordering and adjusting items based on the aggregation
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))
    
    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]
    
    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version, the bug related to handling split object-dtype blocks and error handling has been addressed to ensure proper aggregation within the DataFrameGroupBy object.
