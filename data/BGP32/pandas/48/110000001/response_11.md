The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function lies in the logic related to handling split blocks and handling deleted items. The function is trying to aggregate data blocks based on certain conditions, but there are issues with how split blocks are handled and how deleted items are excluded.

The bug causes incorrect aggregation results, especially when dealing with split blocks, resulting in errors or incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle split blocks and deleted items while aggregating the data blocks. Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=1))
            except TypeError:
                continue
            else:
                result = cast(DataFrame, result)
                result = result._data.blocks[0].values
                if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)

        if not isinstance(result, DataFrame) and result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version above, we have removed the handling of split blocks and deleted items as they were leading to issues in the aggregation process. This simplified version should now correctly aggregate the data blocks without causing errors related to split blocks and deleted items.
