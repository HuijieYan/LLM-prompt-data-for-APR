The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in `generic.py` has a few potential error locations. The main cause of the bug seems to be related to handling block splitting and aggregation of data within the group. The bug arises when splitting object-dtype blocks into multiple blocks and then trying to aggregate them. The splitting of blocks and handling of exceptions during aggregation result in improper data manipulation and may lead to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling split blocks and how the aggregation is performed. Additionally, we should ensure that the indexes and locations of the blocks are updated correctly after aggregation.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    
    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    agg_items = self._labels
    data = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
    if numeric_only:
        data = data.select_dtypes(include=[np.number])
        
    gb = self.groupby
        
    for label, group in data.groupby(gb.grouper):
        try:
            result_data, _ = self._aggregate(gb, group, how, alt, min_count=min_count)
        except (DataError, SpecificationError):
            # Handle errors during aggregation
            continue
        
        result_data = self._downcast_to_block(result_data)
        agg_blocks.append(result_data)
    
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version:
- We iterate over the groups formed by the `groupby` operation.
- We call a separate `_aggregate` method to perform the aggregation, which should handle exception cases properly.
- We downcast the aggregated result to the appropriate block format.
- Finally, we return the aggregated blocks and the corresponding group labels.

This version simplifies the logic and improves the handling of aggregation and splitting scenarios within the groupby operation.
