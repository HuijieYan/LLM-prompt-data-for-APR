### Analysis:
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is responsible for aggregating data blocks in a DataFrame groupby operation. One potential bug location is in the exception handling block, specifically in the `except NotImplementedError` section where the `alt` function is called to handle non-applicable functions. There seems to be an issue with how the result of this call is handled and cast back to the original data type. This could lead to incorrect results or errors in the aggregation process.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when an exception is raised in the `except NotImplementedError` block, and the block data are not excluded correctly from the aggregation results. Additionally, there might be issues with proper casting and handling of objects within this block, leading to errors in the aggregation process.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the block data are correctly excluded when an exception is caught in the `except NotImplementedError` block.
2. Properly handle the casting and conversion back to the original data type after exceptions are raised to avoid errors in the aggregation process.

### Updated Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis)).reset_index(drop=True)
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                result = maybe_convert_objects(result)

            agg_block = make_block(result, placement=s.index)

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Clean up split blocks if needed
    if split_items:
        for locs, result in zip(split_items, split_frames):
            for i, loc in enumerate(locs):
                new_items.append(np.array([loc], dtype=locs.dtype))
                agg_blocks.append(make_block(result.iloc[:, [i]].values, s.index))

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))
    
    # Adjust indexer to account for removed items 
    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        indexer = np.array([idx for idx in indexer if idx not in deleted])

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : offset + loc]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By making these corrections to the exception handling block, casting, and exclusion of block data, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases.
