### Analysis:
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is responsible for aggregating blocks of data based on certain criteria. The function seems to be encountering issues when dealing with objects of different types and shapes, leading to errors during aggregation.

### Error Locations:
1. The handling of split object-dtype blocks in the `else` block after catching a `TypeError` might not be executed correctly.
2. The logic for handling and cleaning up split blocks in the `if split_items` block can be improved.
3. Indexing into blocks and assigning new values to `agg_blocks` may lead to incorrect assignments.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs due to improper handling of split object-dtype blocks, resulting in errors during aggregation. Additionally, the indexing and assignment operations within the `for block in data.blocks` loop may lead to incorrect results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Correctly handle split object-dtype blocks when encountered during aggregation.
2. Improve the logic for cleaning up split blocks after aggregation to ensure correct results.
3. Ensure proper indexing and assignment to `agg_blocks` to avoid errors.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    
    no_result = object()
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                # exclude the block if alternate method is not available
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                continue
            else:
                result = cast(DataFrame, result)
                if len(result._data.blocks) != 1:
                    split_items.append(locs)
                    split_frames.append(result)
                    continue

                result = result._data.blocks[0].values
                if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)

        if not isinstance(result, DataFrame) and result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    if split_items:
        for locs, result in zip(split_items, split_frames):
            for i, loc in enumerate(locs):
                new_loc = np.array([loc], dtype=locs.dtype)
                agg_blocks.append(result.iloc[:, [i]])
                data.items = data.items.insert(len(data.items), new_loc)
    
    for i, blk in enumerate(agg_blocks):
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        new_locs = data.items.take(np.array([i]))
        blk.make_block(blk.values, new_locs)

    return agg_blocks, data.items
```

Now, by properly handling split blocks, cleaning up after aggregation, and ensuring accurate indexing, the function should be able to aggregate data without encountering errors.
