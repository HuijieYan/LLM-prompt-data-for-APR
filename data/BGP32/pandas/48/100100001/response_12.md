## Analysis
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is related to the aggregation process in pandas groupby operations. The function is encountering issues when trying to aggregate data. The potential error locations include handling exceptions, dtype conversion, and the logic related to split object-dtype blocks.

## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is causing it to fail when trying to handle split object-dtype blocks. The function encounters issues when an object-dtype block is split into multiple blocks, leading to incorrect aggregation results.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to address the handling of split object-dtype blocks in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. Specifically, we should ensure that the logic for dealing with split items and frames aligns correctly to prevent aggregation errors.

## The Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                deleted_items.append(block.mgr_locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[block.mgr_locs]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            result = s.agg(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))

        if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            result = result.values
        if result is not None:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

After applying these changes, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should be able to correctly aggregate data without encountering issues related to split object-dtype blocks.
