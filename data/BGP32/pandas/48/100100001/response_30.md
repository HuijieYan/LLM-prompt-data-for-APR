### Analysis:
1. The `_cython_agg_blocks` function is responsible for aggregating data based on specified criteria.
2. The function iterates over blocks of data and applies aggregation functions using the `self.grouper` object.
3. The issue seems to arise from the aggregation logic and assumptions made about the input data structure.
4. The bug may be related to handling split object-dtype blocks and aggregating them correctly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug may be due to incorrect handling of split object-dtype blocks within the `try` block when catching a `TypeError`. The function is splitting object blocks into multiple blocks but not aggregating them properly, leading to mismatched shapes and resulting errors.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when object-dtype blocks are split into multiple blocks, their aggregation is handled correctly. This involves aggregating each split block properly and reshaping the results as needed.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        no_result = object()

        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array

        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)

            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            else:
                result = cast(DataFrame, result)

                if len(result._data.blocks) != 1:
                    split_blocks = list(result._data.blocks)
                    for split_block in split_blocks:
                        agg_block = block.make_block(split_block.values)
                        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
                        new_items.append(locs)
                    continue

                result = result._data.blocks[0].values

                if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)

        assert not isinstance(result, DataFrame)

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our
    # current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version of the function handles the split object-dtype blocks by properly aggregating each split block and reshaping the results as needed.
