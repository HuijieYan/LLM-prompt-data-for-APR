### Analysis:
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is related to groupby operations in Pandas. The function is responsible for aggregating blocks of data based on specified aggregation methods. The bug seems to arise from the logic used to handle different types of data blocks and how they are aggregated.

### Identified Issue:
The bug seems to be caused by the handling of different block types and the aggregation logic based on the aggregation method used. There are multiple paths in the function that can lead to incorrect aggregation or handling of the data, especially with certain methods like "ohlc".

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes incorrect aggregation results when dealing with certain block types or aggregation methods. This leads to failures when the function is used in the test cases provided.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure a consistent approach to handling different block types and aggregation methods.
2. Check the aggregation results for correctness and properly handling exceptions.
3. Handle split blocks and aggregation in a more consistent manner to avoid errors.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array

        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is not None:
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            else:
                raise DataError("No suitable method for aggregation")

        if not isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version focuses on consistent handling of different block types and aggregation methods to ensure accurate results based on the provided input.

After applying this fix, the function should pass the failing test cases provided.
