### Analysis:
The `'_cython_agg_blocks'` function in the `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` file is designed to aggregate data blocks based on certain conditions. The issue seems to stem from the handling of blocks and their aggregation within the function. The function goes through each block within the data and applies aggregation operations as specified by the `how` parameter.

### Identified Bug:
The bug seems to be related to the logic for casting and handling the aggregated results within the function. There are issues with how the function processes and handles the data blocks being aggregated, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug causes the function to produce incorrect results when aggregating data blocks, especially when dealing with numeric operations. This can lead to incorrect aggregation outcomes, thus failing the related test cases.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to revise the logic for handling the aggregation of data blocks within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. It's essential to ensure that the aggregation process is applied correctly to each block and that the results are cast and handled appropriately.

### Corrected Code:
```python
# Fixed version of the '_cython_agg_blocks' function
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how=how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                continue
            result = block.values.apply(alt)
            
        if not isinstance(result, Block):
            result = make_block(result, placement=block.mgr_locs)
        
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs)
        agg_blocks.append(result)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version of the function includes changes in the logic for handling block aggregation results and reset locs of the blocks.

By making these changes, the function should now correctly aggregate the data blocks and align the results with the expected outcomes, passing the failing test cases.
