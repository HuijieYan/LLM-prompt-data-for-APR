### Analysis:
The `_cython_agg_blocks` function is responsible for aggregating blocks of data within the groupby operation in the `generic.py` file. The bug seems to be related to the handling of alternate aggregation methods (`alt`) when encountering a `NotImplementedError`.

### Identified Bug:
The bug occurs when an alternate aggregation method is provided (`alt` is not `None`), and an exception is raised during the aggregation process. In this case, the block is incorrectly excluded from the aggregation result, leading to incorrect output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the handling of exceptions during aggregation to properly catch and process them without excluding blocks.
2. Adjust the logic to retain the block in the aggregation result even if an exception occurs during alternate aggregation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is not None:
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                    obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                try:
                    result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                except TypeError:
                    pass

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                try:
                    result = type(block.values)._from_sequence(
                        result.ravel(), dtype=block.values.dtype
                    )
                except ValueError:
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    offset = 0
    for index, agg_block in zip(np.concatenate(new_items), agg_blocks):
        loc = len(agg_block.mgr_locs)
        agg_block.mgr_locs = index[offset: (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, data.items.take(np.sort(np.concatenate(new_items)))
```

By making the suggested modifications to handle exceptions during aggregation and ensuring that all blocks are retained in the aggregations, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests and produce the expected results.
