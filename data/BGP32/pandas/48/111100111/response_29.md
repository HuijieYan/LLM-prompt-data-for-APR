### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class, which extends `GroupBy`.
2. The function is designed to handle aggregation operations on blocks of data within a `DataFrameGroupBy` object.
3. The `GitHub` issue describes a `TypeError` that occurs when calling `mean`, `median`, or `std` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with columns of nullable integers.
4. The issue is related to the handling of nullable integer data types in aggregation operations.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The bug arises from the interaction between the nullable integer data type (`'Int64'`) and the aggregation functions like `mean`, `median`, and `var`.
2. The function `_cython_agg_blocks` doesn't handle the nullable integer data type properly in the aggregation process.
3. When trying to aggregate nullable integer data with functions like `mean` or `median`, a `TypeError` occurs.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to properly handle nullable integer data during aggregation operations.
2. Check for nullable integer data types before performing aggregation calculations.
3. Ensure that the aggregation functions are compatible with nullable integer data.

### Bug-fixed version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:
```python
    def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        # Data to aggregate
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

        # Filter numeric data only if specified
        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

        for block in data.blocks:
            # Check if the block has nullable integer data
            if block.dtype == pd.Int64Dtype():
                # Handle nullable integer data separately
                result = block._nullable_series_agg(how, axis=self.axis, alt=alt)
            else:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

            # Handle the result and create the aggregation Block
            if result is not None:
                result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
                agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

                new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
                agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

        if not agg_blocks:
            raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

        # Reorder the items in the BlockManager to match the aggregation
        indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
        agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

        # Update the locs in the blocks to reflect the current ordering
        offset = 0
        for blk in agg_blocks:
            loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
            blk.mgr_locs = BlockPlacement(slice(offset, offset + loc, 1))
            offset += loc

        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

### Summary:
1. The bug was caused by the incorrect handling of nullable integer data types in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class.
2. The bug fix involves checking for nullable integer data types and handling them separately during aggregation operations.
3. The bug-fixed version of the function properly handles nullable integer data and ensures compatibility with aggregation functions like `mean`, `median`, and `var`.
