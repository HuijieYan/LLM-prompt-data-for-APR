### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the `generic.py` file of pandas.
- The buggy function is responsible for aggregating data within a `DataFrameGroupBy` object based on certain criteria (`how`, `numeric_only`, `min_count`).
- The buggy function works with a `BlockManager` object that contains the data to aggregate.
- The issue reported on GitHub pertains to calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` dtype resulting in a `TypeError`.
- The bug seems to be related to the incorrect aggregation of data within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is likely caused by a type inconsistency or a misinterpretation of data during the aggregation process within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Ensure that the aggregation process in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function correctly handles the nullable integer data type and is aligned with the expectations of the calling context.
- Double-check the logic related to data handling and aggregation within the function to avoid type issues.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )
        result = maybe_convert_objects(result, block.values)

        agg_block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = BlockPlacement(indexer[offset : offset + loc])
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By fixing the logic related to the data aggregation process within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
