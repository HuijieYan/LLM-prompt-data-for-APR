### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the `generic.py` file of pandas.
2. The function is responsible for aggregation operations on blocks within the DataFrameGroupBy object.
3. The function seems to have an issue causing a TypeError when `mean`, `median`, or `var` functions are called.
4. The `DataFrame` object `self.obj` contains two columns 'a' and 'b' with nullable integer values.
5. The function extracts the data to aggregate from `data` using `_get_data_to_aggregate`.
6. It then iterates over the blocks present in the data and tries to perform aggregation operations like `mean`, `median`, etc., but encounters a TypeError.
7. The issue reported on GitHub relates to a similar problem where calling `mean` on a nullable integer grouped object results in a TypeError.

### Bug Cause:
The bug may be caused due to an issue with handling nullable integer data types during aggregation operations in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure proper handling of nullable integer datatype during aggregation.
2. Check for any conversion issues that may arise when performing operations like `mean`, `median`, etc., on nullable integer data.
3. Adjust any data processing steps to correctly handle nullable integers.

### Bug-fixed Version of `_cython_agg_blocks`:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    # Removed deleted_items, split_items, split_frames
    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result = no_result

        try:
            agg_func = getattr(block.values, how)
            result = agg_func(axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        except (TypeError, AttributeError):
            if alt is None:
                raise DataError(f"Unable to perform aggregation with '{how}' operation")
            
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            result = s.agg(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
        
        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result, block.values)
            agg_blocks.append(block.make_block(result))
            new_items.append(locs)
    
    if not (agg_blocks or new_items):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
    
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))
    
    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By making the above changes, the function should be able to handle nullable integer data more appropriately during aggregation operations.
