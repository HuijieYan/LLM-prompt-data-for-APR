## Analysis
The bug occurs when calling the `mean`, `median`, or `var` functions on a DataFrameGroupBy object with `Int64` data type columns. The bug is related to incorrect handling of nullable integer data types during aggregation, leading to a `TypeError`.

The provided code snippet is a part of the `pandas` library, where the `DataFrameGroupBy` class is extended with the `_cython_agg_blocks` method. This method handles the aggregation operations for the grouped data and supports various functions like mean, var, etc.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs due to the improper handling of nullable integer data types during aggregation. The incorrect handling of the nullable integer data type leads to a `TypeError` when calling the function on a DataFrameGroupBy object.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the nullable integer data type is correctly handled during aggregation operations. Specifically, the code should properly handle the nullable nature of the integer data type when computing the result of aggregation functions like mean, median, or var.

## Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` method with bug fixes to handle nullable integer data types properly:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                # Handle non-applicable functions
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
    
    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Adjust the locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

With these changes, the `_cython_agg_blocks` method should correctly handle nullable integer data types during aggregation operations, fixing the TypeError issue when calling `mean`, `median`, or `var` on a DataFrameGroupBy object with `Int64` columns.
