### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is a method within the class `DataFrameGroupBy`, which extends `GroupBy`. This function is supposed to perform aggregation operations on data blocks.
2. The function takes parameters `how` (string), `alt` (any), `numeric_only` (boolean), and `min_count` (int), along with `self` reference.
3. The buggy function is failing to handle the case when `how` is set to 'ohlc' and an `alt` function is defined. It leads to issues with block aggregation and the final output.
4. The failing test case aims to verify that applying certain aggregation functions (mean, median, var) on a nullable integer column of a DataFrame when grouped by another column produces the expected output.
5. The issue is reported on GitHub regarding a TypeError when calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype, which aligns with the failing test scenario.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function arises from the handling of the `alt` parameter when `how` is 'ohlc'. It results in an incorrect aggregation process, eventually leading to a DataError.

### Suggested Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles the 'ohlc' case properly, especially when an alternative function (alt) is provided. This may involve revisiting the logic around how the `alt` function is applied during aggregation.

### Correction in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Manage 'ohlc' case with alt function
            if how == "ohlc" and alt is not None:
                obj = self.obj[block.items[0]]  # Get the sub-DataFrame for the block
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                result = s[alt](axis=self.axis)  # Apply alt function
        finally:
            if result is not None and result != object():
                result = maybe_convert_objects(result, try_float=True)

                # Create a new Block from the aggregated result
                agg_blocks.append(block.make_block(result))
                new_items.append(np.array(locs))

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Update the items based on the new aggregation
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    # Update the locs of the aggregated blocks
    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = BlockPlacement(slice(offset, offset + loc, 1))
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

Applying the suggested fix above should address the bug and enable the function to aggregate values correctly, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
