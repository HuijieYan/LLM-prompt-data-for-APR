### Bug Analysis:
- The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class of the `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` file is causing a `TypeError` when calling certain aggregation functions like `mean`, `median`, and `var` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with nullable integer data type (`dtype='Int64'`).
- The issue is related to computing the aggregation result for nullable integer columns within a `DataFrameGroupBy` object.
- The failing test case is trying to group a DataFrame with `Int64` type columns and call `mean`, `median`, or `var` on the resulting `DataFrameGroupBy` object, which leads to the `TypeError`.

### Bug Location:
- The bug seems to be occurring during the processing of the `DataFrameGroupBy` object when calling certain grouping functions like `mean`, `median`, or `var` on nullable integer data.
- The bug is likely within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function where numeric aggregation is handled specifically for different data types.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is likely caused by the way nullable integer data is handled during numeric aggregation within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.
- The implementation within the function might not be properly handling nullable integers when computing the aggregation result for certain functions like `mean`, `median`, or `var`.

### Proposed Fix Strategy:
- The bug could be fixed by ensuring that proper handling of nullable integer data is implemented within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to support aggregation functions like `mean`, `median`, and `var` for nullable integers.
- The fix should focus on correctly processing nullable integer data during numeric aggregation within the function to prevent the `TypeError` when calling those specific aggregation functions.

### Proposed Solution:
- Below is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # Actual managing of mgr_locs should happen via BlockManager.combine
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=self.axis, min_count=min_count)
        except NotImplementedError:
            deleted_items.append(locs)
            continue

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result, try_float=True)
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset block locations to current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    # Handle deleted items
    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = BlockPlacement(indexer[offset : offset + loc])
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

- The proposed fix focuses on correctly handling nullable integer data when processing aggregation functions like `mean`, `median`, or `var` within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to address the `TypeError` issue.

### Expected Outcome:
- With the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, the `DataFrameGroupBy` object should be able to handle nullable integer data properly when aggregating with functions like `mean`, `median`, or `var`.
- The corrected function should pass the failing test cases associated with `mean`, `median`, and `var` aggregation functions on nullable integer data types, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
