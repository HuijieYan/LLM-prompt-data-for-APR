### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is failing when trying to aggregate data, resulting in a TypeError when trying to call functions like `mean`, `median`, and `var`. The issue is related to calling mean on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with Int64 dtype, as described in the GitHub issue. The function is not handling the nullable integer data type properly, leading to the type error.

### Bug Location:
The issue is likely occurring when trying to calculate the result for `mean`, `median`, or `var` functions within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. The problem lies in how the aggregation is being done with the nullable integer data type.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug is caused by the `_cython_agg_blocks` function not handling the nullable integer data type correctly during aggregation. This results in a TypeError when functions like `mean`, `median`, and `var` are called on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with nullable integer values. The function needs to be modified to properly handle nullable integer data type during aggregation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the nullable integer data type is properly handled during aggregation.
2. Check the specific data type being processed and apply the necessary conversions if needed.
3. Make sure that the result is correctly calculated and casted to the appropriate type to avoid the TypeError.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        dtype = block.dtype

        if dtype.kind in ['i', 'u', 'f']:  # Handle integer and float data types
            try:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
            except NotImplementedError:
                result = no_result

        if result is not no_result:
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    # Adjust the indexer to account for the items we have removed
    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should properly handle nullable integer data types during aggregation, fixing the TypeError issue reported in the GitHub bug.
