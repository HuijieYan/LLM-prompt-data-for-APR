### Issue Analysis:
1. The issue is related to calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with the `Int64` dtype, resulting in a TypeError.
2. The specific error occurs when using the `nullable integer data type`, causing issues with functions like `mean`, `median`, and `std`.
3. The test case provided in the GitHub issue expects the mean values after grouping by column 'a' with 'b' values [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] to be [1.5, 3.5, 5.5, 7.5].
4. The issue is reproducible with pandas version 1.0.1 and numpy version 1.18.1.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is used to aggregate data blocks in a `DataFrameGroupBy` object.
2. The error is likely due to handling the nullable integer data type incorrectly during the aggregation process.
3. The data may not be properly converted before applying the aggregation function, leading to a TypeError when functions like `mean` are called on nullable integer data.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure proper handling of nullable integer data during the aggregation process.
2. As the issue is related to incorrect handling of Int64 dtype during aggregation, adjust the logic to correctly process nullable integers.
  
### Bug-fix the Buggy Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.convert(dtypes='numeric', copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    idx: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        if block.is_numeric:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )

        if result is not no_result:
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
            idx.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    idx_array = np.concatenate(idx)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.argsort(idx_array))

    offset = 0
    for blk, locs in zip(agg_blocks, idx):
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = locs + offset
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By using `convert` to ensure proper handling of nullable integer (Int64) data and adjusting the logic for aggregation, the corrected function should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
