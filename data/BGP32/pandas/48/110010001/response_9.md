### Analysis:
The error messages indicate that there is an issue with casting values from dtype 'float64' to 'int64' using `astype()` function, causing a TypeError. This error arises when trying to safely cast non-equivalent types which results in a failing test for functions like 'mean', 'median', or 'var' when using nullable integer values. The bug seems to be related to converting float values to integer values, but the conversion is not successful due to data type incompatibility.

### Error Cause:
The bug arises when trying to cast float values to integer values using `astype()` function, but the casting rule 'safe' prevents the casting from happening due to the difference in data types.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
The strategy to address this bug could involve ensuring that the casting operation from float to integer data types is performed correctly. We can adjust the logic for this casting operation to handle the conversion appropriately.

### Bug Fix for the Buggy Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to address the bug described above:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    # Initialize lists to store aggregated data and relevant information
    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    # Iterate over data blocks to perform aggregation
    for block in self._get_data_to_aggregate().blocks:
        # Perform aggregation based on given methods
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                # Exclude the block if operation cannot be performed in an alternative way
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[block.mgr_locs]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except:
                # Error in aggregation, exclude the block
                deleted_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
                continue

        # Handle aggregation results and perform appropriate data type conversion
        concated_result = np.concatenate(result) if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) else result
        if concated_result.dtype.kind == 'f':
            concated_result = concated_result.astype('int64')

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(concated_result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # Further logic to adjust and return aggregated results
    # ...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, the appropriate handling of the aggregation result is achieved by converting float values to integer data type (int64). This adjustment will help in avoiding the initial type casting issue and stabilize the aggregation process.
