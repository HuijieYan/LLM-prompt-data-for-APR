### Analysis
The error occurs during casting from a float (`float64`) to an integer (`int64`). The function `full_agg_controller` which tries to cast the result to the original dtype is encountering this issue. The error message specifically mentions the `astype` operation that fails due to the non-equivalent nature of the values.

### Bug Location
The bug is present in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function where the values are being aggregated and casted to a specific dtype, causing the `safe_cast` function to trigger an error.

### Bug Explanation
The bug happens when the function tries to cast float values to integer values, which are non-equivalent and not safely castable. As a result, it raises a TypeError when attempting to `astype` the values to the target dtype.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the casting operation between floats and integers is handled properly. One approach is to keep the result as floats if there's a possibility of encountering non-equivalent conversions.

### Corrected Version
Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            result = block.values.agg(how)
            
        if isinstance(result, pd.DataFrame):
            result = result._get_values(dtype=block.dtype)

        if block.is_extension:
            result = result.astype(block.dtype, copy=False)

        agg_block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    return agg_blocks, data.items
```

This corrected version resolves the issue of non-equivalent casting by first performing aggregation using DataFrame's `agg` method and then handling dtype adjustments correctly.
