### Analysis:
The error message indicates a problem with casting values from a float64 dtype to an int64 dtype using the `"safe"` casting rule in the `safe_cast` function. The error occurs during processing the result of an aggregation function in the `_cython_agg_blocks` method, specifically when trying to cast float values back to the original integer dtype.

### Potential Error Location:
The error likely occurs in the following section of the `_cython_agg_blocks` method:
```python
result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
```
This line attempts to downcast the result to the dtype of the original block. Since we are dealing with float values that need to be equivalent to ints, the downcast operation could be causing the issue.

### Cause of the Bug:
The likely cause of the bug is that the downcast operation using `maybe_downcast_numeric` is not preserving the equivalency between float values and integer values required for safe casting. As a result, the downcast operation raises a TypeError when trying to convert float values to the original integer dtype.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the downcasting of float values to the original integer dtype correctly, ensuring that the values remain equivalent after the cast. We may need to modify the downcast operation or implement a custom cast that addresses the equivalency requirement between float and int values.

### Corrected Version of the Method:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` method with a modified approach to downcasting:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Handle alternative aggregation method if applicable
            if alt is None:
                raise SpecificationError(
                    "Cannot handle non-numeric types for aggregation."
                )
            result = alt(block.values, axis=self.axis)

        if result is not no_result:
            # Perform downcast ensuring equivalence between float and int
            casted = maybe_convert_objects(result, dtype=block.dtype)
            if not np.array_equal(result, casted):
                raise DataError(
                    f"Cannot safely cast non-equivalent {result.dtype} to {block.values.dtype}"
                )
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(casted)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    ...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, we explicitly verify the equivalence between the result after downcasting and the original float values, ensuring that the cast operation is safe. By handling the conversion carefully, we can prevent the TypeError related to casting non-equivalent types.

This updated approach should address the casting issue encountered in the original implementation.
