### Analysis:
The error is occurring when trying to cast floating-point values to integer values during aggregation. The `safe_cast` function is being called, which attempts to safely cast values to the specified dtype, handling exceptions and checking for equivalency between the original and casted arrays. However, the error is raised when attempting to cast float values to integer values, which is not allowed by the safe casting rule.

### Bug Location:
The bug is likely happening when trying to cast float arrays to integer arrays, more specifically in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function where data aggregation is being performed.

### Bug Cause:
The bug stems from attempting to cast floating-point values to integer values using the safe casting mechanism, which does not permit casting between incompatible types like float64 to int64 when using the "safe" casting rule.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
The bug can be fixed by ensuring that float values do not get cast to integer values directly. If the objective is to aggregate numerical data, it is recommended to work with float data types instead of trying to cast them into integer types, which would lose precision. 

### Corrected Version of the Function:
The corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function that handles the safe casting issue would involve avoiding the direct cast of floating-point numbers to integers, particularly by adjusting the data types or handling non-integer results differently. Below is an example:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    ...
    if result.dtype.kind == 'f':  # Check if result is a float
        result = result.astype(float)  # Explicitly convert to float, avoiding integer casting
    ...
```

In this corrected version, the check for float dtype could assist in knowing how to treat the results to preserve type correctness during aggregation. Remember that handling floating-point numbers as integers may result in data loss or casting errors.
