### Analysis:
- The function `_cython_agg_blocks` is supposed to aggregate blocks of data based on specified aggregation functions. However, the code is running into issues related to safe casting of non-equivalent data types.
- The error message indicates a failure in casting from `float64` to `int64` safely according to the rules.
- The issue is likely triggered by invalid conversions when trying to cast the aggregated result to the appropriate dtype.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the casting operations within the function `_cython_agg_blocks` are handled correctly and safely. Specifically, the code should be modified to handle cases where non-equivalent data types are encountered during aggregation.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def safe_cast(values, dtype, copy: bool):
    """
    Safely cast the values to the dtype if they
    are equivalent, meaning floats must be equivalent to the
    ints.
    """
    try:
        casted_values = values.astype(dtype, casting="safe", copy=copy)
    except TypeError:
        if np.issubdtype(values.dtype, np.floating) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
            if np.all(np.mod(values, 1) == 0):  # Check if values are integer-equivalent
                casted_values = values.astype(dtype)
            else:
                raise TypeError(
                    f"Cannot safely cast non-equivalent {values.dtype} to {np.dtype(dtype)}"
                )
        else:
            raise
    return casted_values

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # Existing code remains mostly the same with the following modification
    
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Existing code here...

        if result is not no_result:
            # Handle safe type casting
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result)
            result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, dtype=getattr(result, "dtype", None))
            result = safe_cast(result, block.dtype, copy=False)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
    
    # Existing code here...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By incorporating a robust safe casting mechanism in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, we ensure that aggregations involving different data types are handled correctly, mitigating the error seen in the failing tests.
