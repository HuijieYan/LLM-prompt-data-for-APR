### Analysis:
The error message indicates a TypeError occurring in the `astype` method while trying to cast an array from `float64` to `int64` under the rule of 'safe'. This issue is related to casting float values to integers, and it is triggered within the `_cython_agg_blocks` method of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class.

### Bugs in the Buggy Function:
1. The function is handling cast exceptions incorrectly, leading to a wrong type conversion.
2. There is a block intended to cast back to the original dtype, which can result in casting errors.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by attempting to cast float64 values directly to int64 using the 'safe' casting mode. The conversion from float64 to int64 cannot be done safely in this case, leading to the `TypeError` being raised.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, it is necessary to handle the conversion from float64 to int64 in a way that prevents the error. The handling should safely cast the values, and if they are not equivalent, an appropriate response should be provided.

### Corrected Version of `_cython_agg_blocks`:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # handle exceptions for non-numeric functions like 'ohlc'
            if alt is None:
                # Exclude the block if we can't perform the operation an alternate way
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                # Exclude the block if an exception occurs during aggregation
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            else:
                result = cast(DataFrame, result)
                # Unwrap DataFrame to get array
                if len(result._data.blocks) != 1:
                    result = result._data.blocks[0].values
                    if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
                        result = result.reshape(1, -1)
        
        if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            result = result._data.blocks[0].values
        
        if result is not no_result:
            # Try to cast the block back to the original dtype
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No applicable functions")

    # Adapt the result to the current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    # Adjust the indexer to account for items that are omitted
    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version handles the dtype conversion issue more effectively by checking for DataFrame instances and applying appropriate conversion logic. This approach should prevent the `TypeError` from being raised during dtype conversion.
