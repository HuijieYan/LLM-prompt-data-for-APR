### Analysis:
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class has a type casting issue. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to an attempt to cast float64 values to int64, which violates the "safe" cast rule.

### Bug Location:
The bug is likely located in the part where there is an attempted type casting operation. Specifically, the code that tries to convert float64 to int64 is causing the error.

### Cause of the Bug:
The core issue is the attempted cast of float64 values to int64, which Python does not consider to be a safe operation, resulting in the given `TypeError`. This failed cast is triggered while processing the aggregation function in the `_cython_agg_blocks` method.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To resolve this bug, you need to ensure that the data types are compatible for casting. One approach could be to handle the float to int conversion explicitly, considering the specific case of your data. Be cautious about the data types and potential errors that could arise during the type conversion.

### Corrected Version:
Here is a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function that includes a safe handling of float to int conversions:

```python
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_integer_dtype

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # Existing code...
    
    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks = []
    new_items = []
    # Existing code...

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Existing code...
        
        if result is not no_result:
            # Existing code...
            # Handle float to int conversion explicitly
            if is_integer_dtype(block.dtype) and not is_integer_dtype(result.dtype):
                # Handle safely converting float64 to int64
                if np.issubdtype(result.dtype, np.floating):
                    if np.all(np.mod(result, 1) == 0):  # Check if all values are integers
                        result = result.astype(np.int64)
                    else:
                        raise TypeError("Cannot safely cast non-integer float64 to int64")
            # Existing code...

    # Existing code...
```

This corrected version includes a conditional block to deal with float to int conversions accurately. It ensures that the casting operation is safe and avoids type compatibility issues like the one stated in the error messages. Make sure to adapt and test this solution within your codebase to handle such scenarios effectively.
