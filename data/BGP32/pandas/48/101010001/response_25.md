1. **Analysis**:
   - The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` is responsible for aggregating blocks of data based on specified criteria.
   - The error message indicates a casting issue when attempting to convert float64 to int64 in the `safe_cast` function.
   
2. **Error Location**:
   - The error is likely occurring when attempting to cast values to the target dtype.
   
3. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - The bug is due to an attempt to cast values from float64 to int64 using `values.astype(dtype, casting="safe", copy=copy)`, which raises a `TypeError: Cannot cast array from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') according to the rule 'safe'`.
  
4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**:
   - To fix this bug, you should handle the dtype casting more carefully. If it's not safe to cast between the specified types, consider other methods or adjust the data appropriately.

5. **Corrected Version**:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        # rest of the code

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result)
            if result.dtype != block.dtype:
                try:
                    result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
                except DataError:
                    # Handle the downcasting failure as needed
                    removed = 1
                    continue
                    
            if block.is_extension:
                result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, block.dtype, skipna=True)
                    
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # rest of the function
```

This corrected version checks for the dtype compatibility before casting and ensures safe handling of the casting operation, which should resolve the TypeError related to dtype casting.
