### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py`.
2. The function encounters a type error during casting from `'float64'` to `'int64'` when performing groupby operations and certain aggregation functions like `mean`, `median`, and `var`.
3. The error message is triggered by the `safe_cast` function in `pandas/core/arrays/integer.py` due to non-equivalent data types being casted unsafely.
4. The bug is related to casting during aggregation with mixed data types in the group resulting in a type mismatch.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper casting or handling of mixed data types within the aggregation process.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check the data type of the result before casting to ensure consistency.
2. Implement conditional handling based on the data type to perform safe casting accordingly.
3. Ensure that the expected output is preserved while resolving the type casting issue.

### Bug-fixed version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
                if len(result.columns) != 1:
                    raise DataError("Unexpected data shape after aggregation")
                result = result[result.columns[0]]

            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Clean up split blocks
    for locs, result in zip(split_items, split_frames):
        agg_blocks.append(result.astype(block.dtype))
        new_items.append(locs)

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        indexer -= (deleted[:, None] < indexer).sum(axis=1)
    
    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : offset + loc]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

### Changes Made:
1. Added condition to check if the result is a DataFrame after aggregation and handled accordingly.
2. Safely downcast the result based on the block's dtype.
3. Ensured that unexpected data shapes after aggregation are handled properly.
4. Adjusted indexer correctly to account for removed items during aggregation.

By applying these changes, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should now correctly handle the data type casting issue during aggregation operations, addressing the reported bug.
