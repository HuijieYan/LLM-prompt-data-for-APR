### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs when trying to perform aggregation operations like `mean`, `median`, or `var` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object containing nullable integer data. The error arises when attempting to cast non-equivalent float64 values to int64, causing a TypeError.

### Error Location:
The error is likely located in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. The function attempts to handle aggregation operations on numeric data, but the casting issue occurs when the data types are not compatible during the aggregation process.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect casting of float64 values to int64 within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. When the function tries to handle the operation on nullable integer data, it fails to safely cast the float values to integer according to the rules, resulting in a TypeError.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the data types are compatible and handle the casting appropriately during the aggregation process. This involves checking and converting the values to the correct data type before performing any aggregation operation.

### Updated Code:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, min_count=min_count)
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                raise NotImplementedError("Alternate aggregation method not provided")

            obj = self.obj[block.mgr_locs]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            result = s.aggregate(alt)
            if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
               result = result._unstack()

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result)

        agg_block: Block = make_block(result, placement=block.mgr_locs)

        new_items.append(agg_block.mgr_locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    agg_items = data.items.take(np.concatenate(new_items))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

With this corrected version, the function should properly handle the aggregation operations on nullable integer data without causing the casting error.
