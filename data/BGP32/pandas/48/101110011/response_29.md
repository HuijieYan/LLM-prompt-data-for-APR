Based on the provided buggy function and the failing test, the issue seems to be related to the TypeError caused by attempting to cast non-equivalent float64 values to int64 in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class.

### Bug Location:
The bug originates from trying to convert float64 values to int64 values, which is not directly supported due to the non-equivalence between the two types.

### Bug Cause:
The error occurs in the `DataFrameGroupBy._cython_agg_blocks` function when trying to convert float64 values to int64, causing a TypeError. This issue arises due to the mismatch in types during casting.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct type conversions are applied to handle float64 values when converting to int64. We can modify the code to explicitly handle the conversion, avoiding type conflicts.

### Corrected Version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    agg_items: List[Tuple[str, Union[Type, str]]] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = block.plain_agg(how, min_count=min_count, gather=False)

        if result is None:
            continue

        if alt is not None:
            non_numeric_agg = False
            try:
                result = self._aggregate_generic(
                    result, alt, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
            except TypeError:
                non_numeric_agg = True

            if non_numeric_agg:
                continue

        agg_blocks.append(
            block.smart_cast(result, "float64").make_block_same_class(result)
        )
        agg_items.append(block.items[0])

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version:
- We make use of the `plain_agg` method to handle the aggregation.
- We explicitly handle the conversion of the result to 'float64' type.
- We skip the aggregation when there is an error due to non-numeric types.
- The corrected version ensures compatibility and correct type handling during the aggregation process.

By applying this fix, the `TypeError` related to the type casting issue should be resolved, and the function should work correctly with the given test cases.
