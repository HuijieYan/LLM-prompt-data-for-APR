### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` inside the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the file `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` is causing issues with type casting during aggregation.
2. The function is used to aggregate data blocks but is failing to properly cast from `float64` to `int64`.
3. The DataFrameGroupBy class is part of the GroupBy functionality in pandas, where different aggregation functions are applied to grouped data.
4. The failing test is trying to apply mean, median, and var functions on nullable integers, which causes a type casting error.
5. The error message indicates the issue of casting from `float64` to `int64`.
6. The GitHub issue further confirms the problematic behavior caused by calling `mean()` on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `_cython_agg_blocks` function not handling the type casting properly when aggregating data blocks. 

### Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the type casting from `float64` to `int64` is properly handled during the aggregation process. We need to adjust the logic in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle this type of conversion seamlessly.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.convert(
            convert_integer=True, convert_boolean=True, convert_floating=False
        )

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array

        result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

        if alt is not None and isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            result = result.agg(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))

        result = maybe_convert_objects(result, dtype=block.dtype)

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    return agg_blocks, data.items
```

By modifying the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle conversion using `maybe_convert_objects` and properly setting the conversion options for integer and boolean types, we can resolve the type casting error and ensure the aggregation functions work correctly on nullable integer data.

This corrected version should fix the bug and allow the failing test to pass without any type casting issues.
