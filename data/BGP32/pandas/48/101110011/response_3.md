### Bug Analysis:
1. The error message indicates a `TypeError` caused by trying to cast a float array to an int array.
2. The failing test function involves applying aggregation functions (`mean`, `median`, and `var`) to groupby objects with nullable integer data.
3. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the specific error when calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype.
4. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` involves aggregation logic that may result in erroneous type casting.

### Error Cause:
1. The `_cython_agg_blocks` function may incorrectly handle the aggregation logic and type casting, resulting in a `float64` to `int64` cast error.
2. In the failing test, the `values` array contains floats, but the function wrongly attempts to cast them to integers.
3. The GitHub issue shows that calling aggregation functions on nullable integer data can lead to this specific casting issue.

### Solution Strategy:
1. Ensure that the `_cython_agg_blocks` function correctly handles type casting when aggregating.
2. Troubleshoot the type casting operations within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to prevent the `float64` to `int64` conversion error.
3. Modify the code to align the type conversion process with the data types involved.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt = None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        except NotImplementedError:
            raise DataError(f"Function '{how}' not supported for this operation")
    
        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result)
    
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
        
    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No data to aggregate")
    
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))
    
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

Now, the corrected code should correctly handle the type casting operations during aggregation, resolving the `float64` to `int64` error.
