### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class of the `pandas` library is causing a `TypeError` when calling the `mean`, `median`, or `var` functions on `DataFrameGroupBy` objects with nullable integer (`Int64`) data type.
- The error is due to failed casting of float values to int values which is not allowed by the `astype` function.
- The issue has been reported on GitHub with the title "calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype results in TypeError".

### Bug Cause:
- The casting of float values to int values in the `safe_cast` function causes the `TypeError`.
- This happens because floats cannot be safely cast to integers and the casting fails.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the casting logic to handle the case where floats cannot be directly cast to integers.
- Ensure that the output of the aggregation functions is consistent with the data type being used.

### Corrected Version of the _cython_agg_blocks Function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        # Handle the case where the result dtype is 'float64'
        if result.dtype == "float64":
            result = result.astype("Int64")

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    agg_items = data.items  # Use original order for agg_items

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

### Changes Made:
- Check if the `dtype` of the `result` after aggregation is `"float64"`.
- If it is, cast it to `"Int64"` before creating the `agg_block`.
- This change ensures that the output values are consistent with the input data type and avoids the casting error.

By making these modifications in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, the `TypeError` issue should be resolved when calling aggregation functions on `DataFrameGroupBy` objects with nullable integer data type.
