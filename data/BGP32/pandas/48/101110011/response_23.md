### Bug Analysis:
- The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class is incorrectly handling the data dtype conversion while performing aggregation on grouped data.
- The error message indicates a `TypeError` occurring during dtype conversion from `float64` to `int64`.
- The issue reported on GitHub also points to an error when calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- The issue seems to be related to improper dtype handling during aggregation operations.
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper dtype conversion logic within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.
- Specifically, the conversion from `float64` to `int64` should be handled correctly to avoid the `TypeError`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function with improved dtype handling:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.convert_dtypes()

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )
        
        if np.issubdtype(result.dtype, np.floating) and block.dtypes[0].kind in 'iu':
            result = result.round().astype(block.dtype)
        
        agg_block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    agg_items = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(agg_items)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version ensures proper dtype conversion from `float64` to `int64` when needed during aggregation operations.

Please test this corrected version against the failing test cases to verify the bug fix.
