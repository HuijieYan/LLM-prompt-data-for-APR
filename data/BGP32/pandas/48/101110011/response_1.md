### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` seems to be causing a `TypeError` when trying to cast non-equivalent float data to integer data during aggregation operations.
2. The error arises from attempting to cast values from type 'float64' to 'int64' using the `astype` function, which throws a `TypeError`.
3. The failing test cases attempt to calculate the mean, median, or variance of numeric values grouped by a specific key, which involves the conversion of float values to integers in certain scenarios.
4. The specific error message `TypeError: Cannot cast array from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') according to the rule 'safe'` indicates the exact issue encountered during the aggregation process.
5. The related GitHub issue mentions a similar problem occurring when calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` dtype columns.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` utilizes the `astype` function to cast values during aggregation operations. However, when encountering float values, an attempt to cast them to integer values results in the mentioned `TypeError` as they are non-equivalent types.

### Suggested Fix Strategy:
To rectify this issue, it is necessary to handle the conversion of float values to integer values more robustly during the aggregation process. This can be achieved by ensuring that the data types are properly aligned before attempting the casting operation.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )
        if result is not None:
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version:
- We extract the desired aggregation results after ensuring the proper data type with `maybe_convert_objects(result)`.
- Exclude unnecessary splitting of object-dtype blocks, focusing on a clearer data handling approach.
- Skip irrelevant error handling and ensure a straightforward path to aggregating the data.

By adapting the function's operations to handle the data correctly and applying datatype conversions as needed, the corrected version should address the `TypeError` encountered during aggregation operations.
