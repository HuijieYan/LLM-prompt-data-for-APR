### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` is causing a `TypeError` related to casting arrays from `float64` to `int64` with the rule 'safe'.
- The errors are raised when calling functions like `mean`, `median`, and `var` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` dtype columns.
- The GitHub issue describes a similar problem with calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with nullable integer data type.
- The issue seems to be related to casting arrays between float and integer types when performing aggregation operations.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by improper casting when converting float values to integer within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.
- The function does not handle the conversion of float values to integer in a safe manner, leading to the `TypeError` during aggregation like `mean`, `median`, `var`.

### Fix Strategy:
- Update the casting logic to handle safe conversion of float values to the expected integer dtype.
- Make sure to apply proper type conversions when performing aggregation operations.

### Bug Fix:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Handle exception
        ...

        if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            result = result.values[0]  # Unwrap DataFrame to get array

        result = maybe_convert_objects(result, dtype=block.dtype)  # Safely convert data types
        agg_block = block.make_block(result)
        
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

This fix changes the way the result is unwrapped from a DataFrame and applies proper type conversions using `maybe_convert_objects` to ensure safe casting when aggregating the values.

By making these modifications, the function should now handle the casting of float values to integer properly during aggregation operations like `mean`, `median`, and `var`. This fix should resolve the `TypeError` issues when performing those operations on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with columns of `Int64` dtype.
