### Analysis:
1. The error is caused by a type casting issue when trying to cast from float64 to int64 using the `astype` method.
2. The error occurs during the aggregation process when calling the `mean`, `median`, or `var` functions.
3. The bug has been reported in a GitHub issue related to calling `mean` on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype.
4. The error message indicates the exact line in the code where the TypeError occurs.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by a type casting error that happens when attempting to convert float64 values to int64 within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. The error arises when trying to cast non-equivalent float64 values to int64, resulting in a TypeError.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the type casting from float64 to int64 is done correctly without raising a TypeError. We can handle this by checking if the values can be cast safely and preserving the equivalency between floats and integers.

### Bug Fix and Updated Function:
Here is the updated and corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            result = block.values
            if alt is not None:
                result = alt(result, axis=1)

        if result is not None:
            # Safely cast the block values to the original dtype
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    for idx, blk in enumerate(agg_blocks):
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer.sum()
        indexer = indexer[1:] - loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version handles the type casting from float64 to int64 more safely during the aggregation process. It ensures that the values are cast without raising a TypeError and maintains equivalency between float and integer values.
