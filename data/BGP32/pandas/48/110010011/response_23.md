### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is related to the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py`.
- The error message `TypeError: Cannot cast array from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') according to the rule 'safe'` indicates a type casting issue when trying to aggregate with mean, median, or variance on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object.
- The GitHub issue describes the problem when calling `mean`, `median`, or `std` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` dtype data, where it results in a `TypeError`.

### Bug Location:
The bug arises in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function when trying to cast the values to a specific dtype, causing a `TypeError` due to non-equivalent data types.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is due to the type casting of float64 to int64 in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. This issue arises when trying to cast non-equivalent data types safely.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, ensure that the data type conversion is done properly when aggregating with mean, median, or var. This might involve adjusting the type casting logic or handling data types more effectively to prevent the TypeError.

### Code Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

### Explanation of Fix:
The fixed version simplifies the `_cython_agg_blocks` function by eliminating unnecessary type casting logic. It focuses on the aggregation process and handling the result blocks correctly. This should prevent the TypeError related to type casting issues.

By making these modifications, the corrected function should now properly handle aggregation operations on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object without raising casting-related errors.
