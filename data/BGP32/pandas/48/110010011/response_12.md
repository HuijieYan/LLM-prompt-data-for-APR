### Analysis:
1. The provided buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks()` in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class is used to aggregate data blocks during groupby operations.
2. The error message indicates a casting issue while trying to perform an aggregation operation, specifically when attempting to safely cast `float64` to `int64`.
3. The bug is causing a `TypeError` due to issues with data type casting operations within the function.
4. The GitHub issue also describes a similar problem when calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype, resulting in a `TypeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Address the casting issue by ensuring the safe casting of data types.
2. Handle the case where the data types differ and require a safe conversion.
3. Update the function logic to handle potential data type mismatches appropriately.
4. Verify the data types being aggregated to prevent errors.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []
    no_result = object()

    for block in self._get_data_to_aggregate().blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array

        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            obj = self.obj[block.mgr_locs]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            result = cast(DataFrame, result)
            if len(result.columns) == 1:
                result = result[result.columns[0]].values.reshape(-1, 1)

        if np.issubdtype(result.dtype, np.floating) and block.dtype != np.float_:
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result)

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result, copy=False)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    return agg_blocks, self._new_items_for_result_ordering(new_items)
```

By updating the `try` block in the function, we ensure to handle data type casting issues and perform appropriate type conversions before aggregation, resolving the TypeError during aggregation operations on `DataFrameGroupBy`.

This fix should address the casting issue and ensure smooth aggregation operations on `DataFrameGroupBy` objects with various data types.
