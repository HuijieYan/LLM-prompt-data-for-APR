1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is a part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the `pandas.core.groupby.generic` module. It is responsible for aggregating data in blocks. The function takes input data from the groupby operation, processes it, and returns aggregated blocks of data along with corresponding indices.

2. The potential error locations in the buggy function could be:
   - In the loop where the data blocks are processed for aggregation.
   - The condition for handling split items may not be functioning correctly.
   - Errors related to datatype conversions during aggregation.
   - The final indexing logic before returning the aggregated blocks.
   
3. The bug in the function might be causing incorrect aggregation of data, leading to the failing test case. This could be due to improper handling of different types of blocks, improper aggregation of values, or incorrect indexing of aggregated data.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper handling of blocks, datatype conversions, aggregation operations, and indexing of aggregated data. Careful attention should be paid to how the different blocks are processed and aggregated in the loop, conditions for handling split items, and the final indexing logic to ensure correct alignment of aggregated blocks.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs)

            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)

    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[:loc]
        indexer = indexer[loc:]

    return agg_blocks, data.items.take(np.sort(np.concatenate(new_items)))
```

This corrected version aims to address potential issues in handling blocks, aggregation operations, and indexing, ensuring the function aggregates data correctly and passes the failing test case.
