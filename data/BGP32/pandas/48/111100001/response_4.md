### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the `pandas.core.groupby.generic` module.
2. The function is responsible for aggregating blocks of data for a groupby operation.
3. The bug is likely related to how the function processes the data blocks and aggregates them, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.
4. The function uses the `grouper` attribute from the class instance to perform aggregation, which seems to be a crucial part of the bug.
5. The failing test case is related to applying aggregation functions (`mean`, `median`, `var`) to nullable integer values and expecting correct results.

### Bug:
The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is likely related to how it handles aggregation for certain data types, specifically when `how` is not supported or when dealing with nullable integer values.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Check the aggregation logic for handling unsupported operations and nullable integer values.
2. Consider alternative approaches for handling these cases and improving the overall robustness of the function.
3. Validate the data type conversions and transformations during aggregation to ensure consistency.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
        for block in data.blocks:
            locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
            try:
                result, _ = self._aggregate_block(block, how, alt, min_count)
            except NotImplementedError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)  # Exclude the block not supporting the operation
                continue
    
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
    
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
    
        if not agg_blocks:
            raise DataError("No valid types to aggregate")
    
        indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
        agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))
    
        if deleted_items:  # Adjust the indexer for removed items
            deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
            ai = np.arange(len(data))
            mask = np.zeros(len(data))
            mask[deleted] = 1
            indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]
    
        offset = 0
        for blk in agg_blocks:
            loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
            blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
            offset += loc
    
        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By refactoring the aggregation logic and ensuring proper exception handling, the corrected function should address the bug and pass the failing test cases.
