### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class, which is a subclass of `GroupBy`.
2. The function is responsible for performing aggregation on data within a `BlockManager`.
3. The bug appears to be related to the handling of exceptions and the aggregation process based on the error response.
4. The bug seems to occur when the function encounters a `NotImplementedError`, leading to incorrect behavior in the aggregation process.
   
### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when the `_cython_agg_blocks` function encounters a `NotImplementedError` during the aggregation process. This error typically occurs when trying to call a function with `how == "ohlc"` and encountering a scenario where an alternative method (`alt`) is not provided. In this case, the block data should be excluded, but due to incorrect handling, the block is not excluded, leading to unexpected behavior in the aggregation process.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when a `NotImplementedError` is raised and an alternative aggregation method (`alt`) is not provided, the corresponding block data is excluded from the aggregation process.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                # exclude the block if alt is not provided
                continue

            # call alternative aggregation method
            result = alt(block.values, axis=self.axis)

        if result is not None:
            # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    for i, blk in enumerate(agg_blocks):
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer.sum()
        indexer += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By making the mentioned adjustments, the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should handle the aggregation process correctly, ensuring proper exclusion of blocks when necessary.
