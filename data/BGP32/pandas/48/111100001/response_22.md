### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class, which inherits from `GroupBy`.
2. The function is responsible for performing aggregation operations on blocks of data.
3. The bug seems to be related to the handling of split object-dtype blocks and the creation of new items.
4. The bug may be causing issues with splitting blocks, resulting in incorrect aggregation results.
5. The failing test `test_apply_to_nullable_integer_returns_float` is checking the behavior of aggregation functions like mean, median, and var on grouped data. The test fails due to the bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function appears to be related to the handling of split object-dtype blocks and the creation of new items. This could result in incorrect aggregation results, causing the failing test to not match the expected output.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the handling of split items and the creation of new items is done correctly. Specifically, when dealing with split object-dtype blocks, the function should unwrap DataFrames and handle split blocks appropriately.

### Corrected Version of `_cython_agg_blocks`:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is not None:
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                try:
                    result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                except TypeError:
                    pass  # Continue and exclude the block
                else:
                    result = cast(DataFrame, result)
                    if len(result._data.blocks) == 1:
                        result = result._data.blocks[0].values
                        if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
                            result = result.reshape(1, -1)
        
        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
    
    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
    
    return agg_blocks, data.items.take(np.concatenate(new_items))
```

The corrected version of the function addresses the issue with handling split blocks and ensures that the aggregation is performed correctly.

This correction should resolve the bug and make the failing test pass.
