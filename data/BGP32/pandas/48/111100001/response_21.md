### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class, which is a subclass of `GroupBy`.
- The function is responsible for performing various operations on blocks of data.
- The test function `test_apply_to_nullable_integer_returns_float` applies aggregate functions to nullable integer values to test the behavior.
- The bug occurs when trying to downcast the result to an object-dtype block in the case of a failed aggregation, causing an error.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function occurs when attempting to downcast the result to the original dtype in case of a failed aggregation.
- The `maybe_downcast_numeric` function is called with the result and the original dtype of the block, but if the block is an object-dtype block, this may result in an error.

### Bug Fix:
- To fix the bug, we should handle the case of object-dtype blocks differently when downcasting the result.
- We can modify the code to cast back the result to the original type if feasible or reshape it to be valid for non-Extension blocks.
- Remove unnecessary reshape operations and ensure the result is correctly handled for object-dtype blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array

        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            # Handle aggregation for object-dtype blocks
            # Create a Series with the original index values
            obj = pd.Series(block.values, index=self.obj.index[loc])
            
            try:
                result = obj.agg(alt)
            except Exception:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            result = cast(DataFrame, result)

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    return agg_blocks, data.items
```

### After applying the fix, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should now handle object-dtype blocks correctly, preventing the error that was occurring.
