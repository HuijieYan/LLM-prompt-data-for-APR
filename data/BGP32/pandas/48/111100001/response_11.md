### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is located in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the file `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py`.
2. The function is responsible for performing aggregation operations on blocks of data within a `DataFrameGroupBy` object.
3. The bug seems to be related to the handling of different types of blocks within the data and potential errors in aggregation.
4. The function seems to be failing when dealing with split object-dtype blocks, possibly causing incorrect aggregation results.
5. The function needs to be modified to handle split object-dtype blocks properly and ensure correct aggregation results.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is likely due to incorrect handling of split object-dtype blocks during aggregation. This causes discrepancies in the results and fails the test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the handling of split object-dtype blocks in the aggregation process and ensure proper aggregation results for all types of blocks.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By focusing the aggregation process on each block individually, we can ensure correct aggregation results even for split object-dtype blocks.
