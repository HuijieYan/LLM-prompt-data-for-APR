### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is a part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class which is a subclass of `GroupBy`.
2. The function is intended to perform aggregation on blocks of data from a DataFrame based on certain conditions.
3. The issue lies in the handling of object-dtype blocks which may be split into multiple blocks during aggregation, causing unexpected behavior.
4. The bug is likely to be related to incorrect handling of split items and frames during aggregation.
5. The failing test cases aim to test aggregation functions on nullable integer values and compare the results with expected output.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when object-dtype blocks are split into multiple blocks during aggregation. The code does not handle this scenario properly, leading to erroneous results during aggregation on these split blocks.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that split items and frames are handled correctly during aggregation.
2. Properly manage the split blocks to maintain consistency in the aggregation process.
3. Update the code to handle cases where the result is a split array or DataFrame.
4. Add necessary checks to handle split blocks and correctly assign values to aggregated blocks.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result, locs = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

        if result is None:
            deleted_items.append(locs)
        else:
            dtype = block.dtype.dtype
            if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
                block_results = [result[val].values for val in result.columns]
            else:
                block_results = [result]

            for vals in block_results:
                if vals is None:
                    deleted_items.append(locs)
                    continue

                # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
                vals = maybe_downcast_numeric(vals, dtype)
                agg_block = block.make_block(vals)
                new_items.append(locs)
                agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        indexer = np.array([idx for idx in indexer if idx not in deleted])

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By making these corrections to properly handle split items and frames during aggregation, the bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should be fixed, allowing it to pass the failing test cases.
