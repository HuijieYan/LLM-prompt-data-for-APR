### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is supposed to aggregate data for a DataFrameGroupBy object.
- The function iterates over blocks of data, aggregates them, and creates new blocks with the aggregated results.
- The bug seems to be related to handling split items where objects are split into multiple blocks.
- The current implementation does not handle split items correctly and leads to incorrect results.

### Bug Cause:
- When handling split items, the logic for creating new items and adding them to agg_blocks is incorrect.
- The function fails to correctly combine split items into the final result, leading to incorrect aggregation results.

### Fix Strategy:
- Revise the logic for handling split items to correctly combine and add them to the final result.
- Update the code to ensure split items are appropriately handled and aggregated.
- Add checks and validations to verify the correctness of the aggregation process.
- Refactor the section of the code dealing with split items for clarity and correctness.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
        for block in data.blocks:
            locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
            try:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
            except NotImplementedError:
                if alt is None:
                    assert how == "ohlc"
                    deleted_items.append(locs)
                    continue
    
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                    obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]
    
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                try:
                    result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                except TypeError:
                    deleted_items.append(locs)
                    continue
                else:
                    result = cast(DataFrame, result)
    
            if result is not None:
                result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
    
                agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
    
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
    
        if not agg_blocks:
            raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
    
        indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
        agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))
    
        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version should address the issue with split items handling in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function and pass the failing test cases.
