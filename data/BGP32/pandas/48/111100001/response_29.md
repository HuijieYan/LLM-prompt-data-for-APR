Based on the buggy function provided, the bug appears to be related to a DataFrameGroupBy method `_cython_agg_blocks()` that is called during aggregation operations. The bug seems to arise when splitting object-dtype blocks into multiple blocks, causing an error in handling the results.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for splitting object-dtype blocks and ensure proper handling of the results. Specifically, we should focus on how to manage the split blocks and merge them correctly before returning the aggregated results.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks()` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # generally if we have numeric_only=False and non-applicable functions
            # try to python agg
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                continue
            else:
                # unwrap DataFrame to get array
                result = result._data.blocks[0].values

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
        new_items.append(locs)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This revised version should address the issue of splitting object-dtype blocks and ensure proper aggregation results are handled before returning them. After implementing this fix, the provided failing test should pass successfully.
