### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is a method of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class, which is a subclass of `GroupBy`.
2. The function loops through data blocks, aggregates the values based on the specified method (`how`), and creates new blocks for the aggregated results.
3. The bug likely stems from how the function handles exceptions and aggregation of data blocks, particularly when `NotImplementedError` is caught.
4. The critical issue seems to be when an exception is encountered during aggregation, leading to inconsistencies in the results.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper handling and consistency in handling exceptions and aggregating data blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Revise the exception handling logic to handle different error cases more consistently.
2. Ensure that exception handling does not lead to inconsistent block handling or results.
3. Update the logic for handling split items and frames to maintain consistency in block processing.
4. Verify that the function aggregates data blocks correctly and returns the results in a consistent manner.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is not None:
                obj = self.obj[block.var_mgr_locs]
                result = obj.apply(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            else:
                result = block.values[0]
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By making the above corrections, we aim to address the issues in aggregating data blocks and ensure that the function behaves consistently across different scenarios.
