### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class is responsible for aggregating blocks of data, but there are several potential error locations within the function.
2. The function seems to have issues with handling split objects and blocks, casting back to original data types, and indexing.
3. The bug seems to arise from improper handling of blocks and data types within the function, leading to incorrect aggregation results.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper handling of split objects, correct casting back to original data types, and appropriate indexing of aggregated blocks.
5. We will provide a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function below:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is not None:
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                try:
                    result = s.agg(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                except TypeError:
                    continue
                else:
                    result = cast(DataFrame, result)
        
        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        if agg_block:
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset:offset+loc]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
``` 

By making the above corrections in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, it should now be able to properly aggregate blocks of data without encountering any errors.
