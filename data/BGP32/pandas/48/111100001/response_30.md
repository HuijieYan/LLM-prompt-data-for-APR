## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class, which is a subclass of `GroupBy`.
2. The function is responsible for aggregating data based on specified parameters like `how`, `numeric_only`, and `min_count`.
3. The error seems to be related to handling object-dtype blocks and splitting them into multiple blocks. 
4. The function is failing due to improper handling of blocks that are split into `List[Block[T], Block[U]]`.

## Bug Explanation:
1. The function `_cython_agg_blocks` tries to aggregate data blocks based on certain conditions like `numeric_only`.
2. When encountering object-dtype blocks that are split into multiple blocks, the function fails to handle them correctly.
3. This results in incorrect aggregation and the function fails to return the expected output.

## Bug Fix:
- To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the splitting of object-dtype blocks into multiple blocks and aggregate them correctly.
- We should address the `split_items` and `split_frames` lists to ensure that each split block is aggregated properly.
- Properly handling the split blocks and aligning the results with the original data items will resolve the issue.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Handle non-numeric aggregations here
            result = self._agg_split_blocks(block, locs, alt, how)
        
        if result is not no_result:
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or self.split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    self._clean_split_blocks()

    return agg_blocks, self.agg_items
```

In the corrected version, the function `_agg_split_blocks` is introduced to handle splitting of object-dtype blocks. The associated `split_items` and `split_frames` lists are replaced with `self.split_items` and `self.split_frames` to ensure proper handling of split blocks. Finally, the `_clean_split_blocks` function is called to clean up any leftover mess from split blocks.
