## Analysis
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is part of the pandas library and is responsible for aggregating data within a GroupBy object. The bug seems to be related to an error in the aggregation process when dealing with a nullable integer array (Int64 dtype) and certain aggregation functions like 'mean', 'median', and 'var'. This issue was reported on GitHub, and it seems that the error occurs when calling these specific aggregation functions on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype columns.

## Bug
The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function seems to arise when operating on nullable integer columns due to a type mismatch or compatibility issue with certain aggregation functions like 'mean', 'median', and 'var'.

## Suggested Fix
To address the bug, we need to handle the aggregation of nullable integer arrays properly, especially when using functions like 'mean', 'median', and 'var'. This may involve explicitly handling the nullable values or adapting the aggregation process to work correctly with nullable integer data types.

## Fixing the Bug
Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to address the bug:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array

        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                raise NotImplementedError("Alternate aggregation method not provided")
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            result = cast(DataFrame, result)

        if not isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version aims to properly handle the aggregation process for nullable integer data types, especially when using functions like 'mean', 'median', and 'var'.

Please test this corrected function with the provided test cases to ensure it resolves the bug reported on GitHub.
