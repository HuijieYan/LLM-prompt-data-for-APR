### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` has a bug causing it to throw a `TypeError` when calling certain aggregate functions (like mean, median, and std) on grouped DataFrame objects with `Int64` dtype. This issue is described in the GitHub post titled "calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype results in TypeError."

### Bug Identification:
The bug occurs when the function receives a `DataFrame` with `Int64` dtype values and attempts to perform aggregation operations like mean, median, or std on grouped data. The bug is related to the handling of `Int64` dtype in the function.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug is caused by the function's handling of the `Int64` dtype during aggregation. The function fails to properly process the `Int64` dtype values when calculating the mean, median, or std on grouped data, resulting in a `TypeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, you need to ensure that the function properly handles the `Int64` dtype during aggregation operations like mean, median, and std. This may involve casting the data to a suitable format or adjusting the aggregation calculations for `Int64` dtype values.

### Bug-fix Function:
Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = block.values
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        
        try:
            if how in ["mean", "median", "std"]:
                result = block.make_block(np.nanmean(result))
            else:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
        
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(result)
    
    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version of the function includes handling for specific aggregation methods like mean, median, and std when dealing with `Int64` dtype values. It calculates the aggregation appropriately for the given dtype to prevent the `TypeError` issue reported in the GitHub post.
