### Analysis:
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is responsible for aggregating blocks of data based on a given function (`how`) and other parameters. The function encounters an issue when handling object-dtype blocks, resulting in a `NotImplementedError`.

### Bug:
The bug occurs when the function encounters an object-dtype block and tries to aggregate it. This leads to a `NotImplementedError` being caught, which results in the block being excluded from further processing.

### Solution:
To fix the bug, we need to handle object-dtype blocks differently. We should add logic to convert object-dtype blocks to a suitable format before attempting aggregation. This will prevent the `NotImplementedError` and ensure a successful aggregation for all block types.

### Code Fix:
Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )
        
        if block.dtype == 'object':
            result = pd.to_numeric(result, errors='coerce')
        
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(result)

    # Rest of the code remains the same

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By adding the conversion of object-dtype blocks to numeric using `pd.to_numeric`, we ensure that all blocks are properly processed during aggregation, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
