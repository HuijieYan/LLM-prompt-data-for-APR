### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is a method of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` file.
2. The issue reported on GitHub (https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/32219) involves calling `mean()` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype resulting in a `TypeError`.
3. The issue seems to be related to handling nullable integer data type (`dtype='Int64'`) during aggregation operations like `mean`.
4. The cause of the bug could be related to the `_cython_agg_blocks` method not handling the nullable integer data type correctly during numeric aggregation.

### Bug cause:
The bug is likely caused by the `_cython_agg_blocks` method not handling nullable integer data type (`dtype='Int64'`) correctly during aggregation operations like `mean`. This is evident from the GitHub issue description where calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype results in a `TypeError`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check for the data type of the blocks during aggregation to handle nullable integer data type (`dtype='Int64'`) appropriately.
2. Ensure that the method can handle nullable integer values without raising a `TypeError` during aggregation operations like `mean`.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` method:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    
    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array

        if block.dtype.name == 'Int64':
            # Handle nullable integer data type during aggregation
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count, my_dtype='Int64')
        else:
            try:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
            except NotImplementedError:
                # Handle other cases where aggregation is not implemented
                continue 

        if result is not no_result:
            if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, (np.ndarray, DataFrame)):
                result = maybe_convert_objects(result, axis=1, copy=False)

            agg_block: Block = make_block(result)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Rest of the method remains the same

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version, we have added a check for the `Int64` data type and handle it appropriately during aggregation to avoid `TypeError` issues.
