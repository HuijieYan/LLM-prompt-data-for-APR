### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is a method of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the `pandas.core.groupby.generic` module.
2. The buggy function is responsible for handling aggregation operations on blocks of data in a `DataFrameGroupBy` object.
3. The bug causes a `TypeError` when calling `mean`, `median`, or `var` functions on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` dtype data.
4. The bug has been reported in GitHub issue #32219, stating that calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype results in a `TypeError`.
5. The bug occurs due to an error in handling the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) in the aggregation process.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `_cython_agg_blocks` method failing to properly handle aggregation operations on blocks of data with a nullable integer (`Int64`) dtype. The error occurs when trying to cast the block back to the original dtype, and the handling of nullable integer blocks is erroneous.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the aggregation operations on `Int64` dtype data are correctly handled, including proper casting back to the original dtype and accounting for nullable integer blocks.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    if alt is not None and how == "ohlc":
        raise DataError("Alternate aggregation not supported with 'ohlc'")

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if not numeric_only:
                # Fallback to python agg
                result = self._python_agg_with_alt(block, alt)
        finally:
            if result is not no_result:
                agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
                new_items.append(locs)
                agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
            else:
                deleted_items.append(locs)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No data to aggregate")

    # Reset locs in blocks to correspond to current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function ensures proper handling of aggregation operations on blocks of data with nullable integer (`Int64`) dtype. By following the suggested strategy and making the necessary adjustments, the bug causing a `TypeError` when calling aggregation functions on `Int64` dtype data in a `DataFrameGroupBy` object should be resolved.
