### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py`.
2. The failing test code is testing various aggregation functions like `mean`, `median`, and `var` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object.
3. The GitHub issue highlights that calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype results in a `TypeError`.
4. The bug seems to be related to handling nullable integer data types during aggregation operations within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class.

### Bug Location:
The bug is most likely located in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class, where the aggregation of data blocks based on specific operations is implemented.

### Bug Cause:
The bug could be caused due to the implementation not properly handling nullable integer data types (`Int64`) during aggregation operations, leading to a `TypeError` when calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the aggregation logic in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function properly handles nullable integer data types (`Int64`) when performing aggregation operations like `mean`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    # Ensure that nullable integer data types are handled properly
    if numeric_only:
        data = data.convert_dtypes()

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )
        
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Update the locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    indexer = data.items
    agg_items = data.items
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[:loc]
        indexer = indexer[loc:]
    
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version, I made sure to convert nullable integer data types to their appropriate form using `convert_dtypes()`. I also simplified the aggregation logic to ensure proper handling of results and updating the locations in the blocks. This should resolve the `TypeError` issue when calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` dtype.
