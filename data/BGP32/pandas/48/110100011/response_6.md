## Analysis:

1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is responsible for aggregating data in a DataFrameGroupBy object.
2. The bug in the function seems to be related to handling nullable integer data types (`'Int64'`).
3. The failing test `test_apply_to_nullable_integer_returns_float` is a part of the test suite for this issue on GitHub.
4. The issue on GitHub reported a TypeError when calling `mean` on a DataFrameGroupBy object with nullable integer data types.
5. The bug seems to be causing issues when trying to aggregate nullable integer data.

## Bug Cause:

The bug appears to be caused by the function not handling nullable integer data types correctly when aggregating data in the DataFrameGroupBy object. This likely leads to a mismatch in data types, resulting in a TypeError during aggregation.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function `_cython_agg_blocks` correctly handles nullable integer data types during aggregation. Specifically, we need to address any potential mismatches or type conversion issues that may arise when dealing with nullable integer data.

## Corrected Version of the Function:

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

        for block in data.blocks:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )

            # Handle nullable integer data type
            if str(result.dtype) == 'Int64':
                result = result.astype(float)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

        if not agg_blocks:
            raise DataError("No data to aggregate")

        # Adjust the locs in the blocks based on current ordering
        indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
        agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version ensures proper handling of nullable integer data types during aggregation within the DataFrameGroupBy object, addressing the bug reported on GitHub.
