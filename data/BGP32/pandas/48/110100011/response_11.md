### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `_cython_agg_blocks` within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the `pandas\core\groupby\generic.py` file.
2. The bug is related to calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype resulting in a TypeError, which is reported in the GitHub issue #32219.
3. The bug occurs when certain functions like mean, median, and std are applied after grouping, leading to a TypeError.
4. The issue in the buggy function seems to be related to handling nullable integer data types correctly while aggregating in a GroupBy operation.
   
### Bug Cause:
1. The bug is caused by inconsistent handling of nullable integer dtype when calling aggregate functions like mean, median, and std.
2. The `get_numeric_data` function is used within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, which might be causing issues with nullable integers.
  
### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if the issue is related to handling nullable integer dtype within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.
2. Adjust the aggregating logic to correctly handle nullable integers during the aggregation process.
   
### Updated Code:
```python
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_integer_dtype

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.select_dtypes(include='number')

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    agg_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        if is_integer_dtype(block.dtype):
            block_dtype = 'int'
        else:
            block_dtype = None
        
        try:
            result = block.agg(how, min_count=min_count, dtype=block_dtype)
        except (TypeError, DataError):
            if alt is not None:
                result = block.agg(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            else:
                raise
            
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
        agg_items.append(locs)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(agg_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    for i, blk in enumerate(agg_blocks):
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[i : i + loc]

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

### Summary:
1. The bug was caused by incorrect handling of nullable integer dtype within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.
2. By adjusting the method to correctly handle nullable integers during aggregation, the bug can be fixed.
3. The updated code provided above should resolve the TypeError issue when applying mean, median, and other aggregate functions on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype.
