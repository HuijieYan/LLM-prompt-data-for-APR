### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks()` is part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the `pandas.core.groupby.generic` module.
2. The function is responsible for calculating aggregation blocks based on specified parameters like `how`, `alt`, `numeric_only`.
3. The GitHub issue reported a problem when calling `.mean()` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` dtype, resulting in a `TypeError`.
4. The issue seems related to the handling of nullable integer data types in aggregation operations.
5. The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of data types within the `_cython_agg_blocks()` function.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function fails to properly handle the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) when performing aggregation operations. This leads to a `TypeError` when calling `.mean()` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper handling of nullable integer data types during aggregation operations in the `_cython_agg_blocks()` function. Specifically, the function should check for nullable integer data types (`Int64`) and perform appropriate conversions before aggregation.

### Corrected Version of the `_cython_agg_blocks()` Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks()` function that addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

        # Iterate over data blocks
        for block in data.blocks:
            result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
            if isinstance(block.dtype, pd.Int64Dtype):
                result = result.astype(float)

            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

        agg_items = data.items.take(np.concatenate(new_items))

        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly check for `Int64` dtype and convert it to `float` before aggregation to avoid any `TypeError` when calling aggregation functions. This fix ensures proper handling of nullable integer data types in the aggregation process.
