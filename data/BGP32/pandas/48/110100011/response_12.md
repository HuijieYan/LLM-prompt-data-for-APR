### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class within the file `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py`.
2. The issue reported on GitHub describes a problem with calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` dtype resulting in a `TypeError`.
3. The failing test function `test_apply_to_nullable_integer_returns_float` in `pandas/tests/groupby/test_function.py` also demonstrates the issue by asserting the incorrect result.
4. The bug seems to arise from how the function handles different data types during aggregation within the groupby operation.

### Error Location:
1. The error might occur when casting the block back to the original dtype in the block aggregation process.
2. There might be issues with how the function is handling the nullable integer dtype leading to the `TypeError`.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The bug seems to occur when trying to cast the result back to the original dtype in the aggregation process, especially when dealing with nullable integer dtype.
2. The error described in the GitHub issue aligns with the problem where calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` dtype results in a `TypeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Focus on how the function handles different data types during the aggregation process.
2. Check the casting process back to the original dtype, especially for nullable integer dtype.
3. Ensure proper handling of nullable integer dtype to avoid the `TypeError` reported in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    ...
    for block in data.blocks:
        ...
        assert not isinstance(result, DataFrame)

        if result is not no_result:
            # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
            result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, block.dtype)  # Changed to maybe_downcast_to_dtype

            if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                ...
                try:
                    # Cast back if feasible
                    result = type(block.values)._from_sequence(
                        result.ravel(), dtype=block.values.dtype
                    )
                except ValueError:
                    ...
                ...
```

By adjusting the part of the function responsible for casting the result back to the original dtype to use `maybe_downcast_to_dtype`, we can handle the nullable integer dtype correctly and avoid the `TypeError`.
