### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class, which inherits from the `GroupBy` class.
2. The function is responsible for aggregating blocks of data based on certain criteria.
3. The issue reported on GitHub is related to calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` dtype resulting in a `TypeError`.
4. The bug seems to be related to handling the aggregation of nullable integer types.
5. The function needs to be modified to handle nullable integer types correctly during aggregation.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the handling of nullable integer types during aggregation in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. The function may not be handling nullable integer types correctly, leading to a `TypeError` when calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with nullable integers.

### Strategy for Fixing:
1. Review the implementation of aggregation logic for handling nullable integer types.
2. Ensure that the function can properly handle nullable integer data during aggregation.
3. Update the logic to handle nullable integers in a way that prevents the `TypeError` when calling `mean`.

### Corrected Version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` Function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        if _is_nullable_integer_dtype(block.dtype):
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
            if result is not None:
                agg_block = block.make_block(result)
                new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
                agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
    
    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
    
    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version, we specifically check for nullable integer types and handle them appropriately during aggregation to prevent the `TypeError` issue reported on GitHub.
