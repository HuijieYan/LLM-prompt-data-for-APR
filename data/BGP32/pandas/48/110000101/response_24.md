### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is that when a DataFrame consisting of multiple columns is processed, it incorrectly aggregates the data. Specifically, when an aggregation function like 'mean' or 'median' is applied, it should be performed column-wise, but due to a mistake, it's being done row-wise. This leads to incorrect results being stored in the 'agg_blocks' list.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug and ensure that the function correctly aggregates the data column-wise, we need to modify the section where the aggregation operation is performed on each block. Specifically, we need to change the axis argument from `axis=1` to `axis=0` when calling the `self.grouper.aggregate` function. This adjustment will ensure that the aggregation is done correctly along the columns.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
    def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

        no_result = object()
        for block in data.blocks:
            result = no_result
            locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
            try:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=0, min_count=min_count
                )
            except NotImplementedError:
                # Python aggregation
                pass

            if result is not no_result:
                result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

                if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                    assert result.ndim == 1 or result.shape[0] == 1
                    try:
                        result = type(block.values)._from_sequence(
                            result.ravel(), dtype=block.values.dtype
                        )
                    except ValueError:
                        result = result.reshape(1, -1)

                agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

                new_items.append(locs)
                agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

        if not agg_blocks:
            raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

        # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
        indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
        agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

        offset = 0
        for blk in agg_blocks:
            loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
            blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
            offset += loc

        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version ensures that the aggregation is correctly performed column-wise, as expected. Now, the function should yield the right results for each column in the DataFrame during the aggregation process.
