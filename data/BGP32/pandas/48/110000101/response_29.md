Based on the given expected values and types of variables, the bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is due to the incorrect handling of result processing and aggregation logic. The function is failing to correctly process the result of the aggregation operation in certain conditions, leading to unexpected behavior and errors.

To fix the bug, the function needs to ensure that the result of the aggregation operation is correctly processed and converted into the appropriate data structure. Additionally, the function should handle special cases where the result may need to be reshaped or modified before assigning it to the `agg_block`.

Below is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function that addresses the identified issue:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], 'Index']:
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is not None:
                obj = self.obj[block.items[0]]
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                result = s.aggregate(alt)
            else:
                raise NotImplementedError("Aggregate function not implemented")
        
        if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            result = result._mgr.blocks[0]
        
        result = maybe_convert_objects(result)
        result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
        agg_block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged

    return agg_blocks, data.items.take(np.sort(np.concatenate(new_items)))
```

This corrected version ensures that the result of the aggregation operation is correctly processed and converted as needed before assigning it to the `agg_block`. It also handles the case where the result is a DataFrame and converts it appropriately.

By making these adjustments, the function should now behave correctly and produce the expected output for the provided test cases.
