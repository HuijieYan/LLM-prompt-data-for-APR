The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is meant to aggregate numerical data in a DataFrameGroupBy object according to a specified method (e.g., mean, median, var). However, there are issues in the handling of the aggregated data that lead to incorrect results. 

The potential causes of the bug include:
1. Improper handling of different block types (extension vs. regular blocks).
2. Incorrect reshaping of result arrays.
3. Inconsistent treatment of DataFrame vs. ndarray types.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the aggregation process properly handles different block types, reshapes the result arrays as needed, and maintains consistency in object types throughout the function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        
        agg_block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    aggregator_items = [data.items.take(np.concatenate(new_items))]
    
    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = np.arange(offset, offset + loc)
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, pd.Index(aggregator_items[0])
```

In this corrected version, I simplified the processing logic, removed unnecessary block type casting and reshaping, and ensured consistent array handling. This should address the bugs and provide the expected output for the test cases provided.
