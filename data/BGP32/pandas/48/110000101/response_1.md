### Analysis
1. The function `_cython_agg_blocks` is intended to aggregate blocks in a DataFrameGroupBy object.
2. The function checks if `numeric_only` is True, then aggregates numeric data. It processes each block in the DataFrame's blocks, aggregates them, and creates a new Block for each aggregation result.
3. The bug seems to be related to handling the `result` variable, which is expected to be a NumPy array but might not be properly managed.
4. The buggy function seems to have issues with how the results of aggregation are handled and stored in `agg_blocks`.
5. We need to ensure that all different aggregation results are correctly processed and stored in `agg_blocks` before returning them.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the result of each aggregation operation is properly handled and added to `agg_blocks`. We will fix this by refining the handling of `result` and creating the `agg_block` properly for each block. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array

        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))                    
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            agg_block: Block = make_block(result, placement=block.mgr_locs)
            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    return agg_blocks, data.items.take(np.concatenate(new_items))
```

This corrected version ensures that each aggregation result is properly stored in `agg_blocks` and the function handles various aggregation types correctly.
