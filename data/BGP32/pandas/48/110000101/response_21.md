The bug in the provided function is due to an issue in handling the result variable and creating the `agg_block`. The function is supposed to aggregate numeric data based on the given `how` operation, but it fails to correctly process the block values and create a valid `agg_block`.

To fix the bug:
- Ensure that the result is properly calculated and handled within the try-except block.
- Create the `agg_block` correctly based on the result.
- Update the new_items list with the locs array for indexing.
- Set the `mgr_locs` of the `agg_block` properly.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                raise NotImplementedError("Aggregation method not supported.")
        
        result = maybe_convert_objects(result)
        result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
        
        # Build the agg_block correctly
        agg_block: Block = make_block(result)
        
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Set correct locs for aggregated blocks
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    for offset, blk in enumerate(agg_blocks):
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = BlockPlacement(np.array(indexer[offset:offset + loc]))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version should now handle the aggregation correctly and create valid `agg_block` objects based on the aggregated results.
