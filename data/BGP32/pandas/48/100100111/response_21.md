### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is supposed to handle the aggregation of data blocks based on the specified method (`how`) and conditions.
- The bug seems to be related to the implementation of aggregation with nullable integer data types when calling `mean`, `median`, or `var`.
- The issue on GitHub indicates that calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype results in a `TypeError`.

### Identified Error:
- The bug might be related to the handling of nullable integer data types during aggregation with the methods like `mean`, `median`, or `var`.

### Proposed Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle the aggregation of nullable integer data types correctly, especially for methods like `mean`, `median`, and `var`.
2. Ensure that the function handles the nullable integer data types appropriately to avoid any `TypeError` when calling aggregation functions.

### Proposed Correction:
Here is a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function with the expected fixes:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        if result is not None:
            df_result = self.obj[data.items[block.mgr_locs.as_array]].groupby(self.grouper).agg(how)
            agg_block = make_block(df_result.values.T, block.mgr_locs)
            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our
    # current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

Make sure to test these changes with the provided failing test cases to ensure that the corrected function passes all the tests successfully.
