The issue arises when calling the mean function on a DataFrameGroupBy object with Int64 dtype, leading to a TypeError. The problem is likely due to the internal implementation of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, specifically when processing data with Int64 dtype during aggregation.

To address this issue, we need to modify the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle the Int64 dtype properly. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks = []
    new_items = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

        agg_block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(np.array(range(block.values.shape[0])))

        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    agg_items = data.items

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

To fix the issue, we removed unnecessary parts of the code and simplified the aggregation process for the DataFrameGroupBy object with Int64 dtype. This corrected function should now handle the aggregation properly without causing a TypeError.

Please test the corrected function with the failing test case provided in the GitHub issue to ensure that it resolves the problem. If you encounter any further issues or have additional requirements, feel free to ask for further assistance.
