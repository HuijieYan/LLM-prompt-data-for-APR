### Analysis
The bug seems to be related to the `agg_blocks` list not being properly populated with the aggregated values. This might be due to issues in extracting the aggregated values from the grouped data or creating the new aggregated blocks.

### Bug Explanation
In the buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks`, the issue arises in getting the result of aggregation for each block in the GroupBy operation. The bug prevents the correct extraction and processing of aggregated values, leading to the TypeError observed in the failing test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the code responsible for extracting and aggregating the data from each block needs to be revised. Specifically, the part where the result of aggregation is obtained from `self.grouper.aggregate` and processed to properly populate the `agg_blocks` list.

### Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array

        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # handle alternative aggregation method if specified
            if alt is not None:
                result = alt(block.values, axis=self.axis)
            else:
                raise

        result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    agg_items = data.items.take(np.hstack(new_items))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

Please test the corrected function against the failing test cases to verify that the bug has been fixed.
