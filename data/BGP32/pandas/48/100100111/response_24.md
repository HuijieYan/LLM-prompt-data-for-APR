### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is part of the `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` file.
2. The function is intended to aggregate data blocks based on specific criteria.
3. The bug causes issues when calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` dtype, resulting in a `TypeError`.
4. The GitHub issue provides a detailed scenario where the bug occurs and the expected output.
5. The bug occurs when applying aggregation functions like `mean`, `median`, and `std` on grouped data with `Int64` dtype.
6. The error does not occur when using functions like `min`, `max`, and `first`, or by working with a single column (`SeriesGroupBy`) instead of the whole DataFrame.
7. The expected output for the failing test is the mean values for each group in the grouped DataFrame.

### Bug Location:
The bug is likely caused by the handling of data types within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, leading to a `TypeError` when performing aggregation on `Int64` data.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the function properly handles the aggregation of `Int64` data.
2. Check the data types and casting within the function to avoid the `TypeError`.
3. Verify the alignment of the columns and data blocks during aggregation to maintain consistency.
4. Consider potential issues related to nullable integer data types.
5. Update the function logic to correctly handle the aggregation of different data types.

### Bug-fixed Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to address the bug:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.select_dtypes(include=['number'])

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )
        agg_blocks.append(result)
        new_items.append(locs)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    agg_items = data.items.take(np.concatenate(new_items))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By updating the function as shown above, it should now correctly handle the aggregation of data blocks with nullable integer data types and avoid the `TypeError` issue described in the GitHub problem statement.
