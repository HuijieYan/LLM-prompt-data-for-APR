The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function seems to be related to the handling of nullable integers in the DataFrame when calling the `mean` function for grouping. The issue described on GitHub also highlights similar problems with calling other aggregation functions like `median` and `std` for nullable integer columns.

### Error Location:
The possible error locations in the buggy function are:
1. Handling of nullable integers in the `ExtensionBlock` blocks when performing aggregation functions.
2. Conversion of the resulting values to the correct dtype after the aggregation operation.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug likely arises due to the incorrect handling of nullable integers when performing the aggregation operation in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. As nullable integers are a newer data type in Pandas, some operations may not be fully supported, leading to errors when calling aggregation functions like `mean`, `median`, and `var` on nullable integer columns.

### Potential Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, you should ensure proper handling of nullable integers during the aggregation process. This may involve converting nullable integer values to regular integers before performing the aggregation operation, and then converting them back if needed after the operation is complete.

### Corrected Function:

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function that should address the issue:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=self.axis, min_count=min_count)

        if isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
            result = result.astype('float64')  # Convert result to float if necessary

        agg_block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = BlockPlacement(indexer[offset : (offset + loc)])
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version ensures proper handling of nullable integers in the aggregation process and should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.

Please test the corrected function with the provided failing test cases to ensure that it now passes without any errors.
