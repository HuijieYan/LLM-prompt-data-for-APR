### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is meant to aggregate data within specific blocks based on the provided parameters.
2. The function seems to be encountering a TypeError when trying to aggregate data in the context of the GitHub issue cited. The error occurs when using nullable integer data type for the 'b' column and calling `mean` after grouping.
3. The bug is likely related to handling nullable integers during aggregation operations, which leads to the TypeError reported in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Location:
1. The bug may be related to the way the function handles nullable integers during aggregation, causing a TypeError when trying to calculate aggregate statistics like mean.
2. The issue seems to be arising in the function's logic for aggregating the data within blocks, especially when dealing with nullable integers.

### Bug Cause:
1. The bug causes a TypeError during aggregation with nullable integers when calling functions like `mean`, `median`, or `var`.
2. It could be due to incorrect handling of nullable integer data types during aggregation operations in the function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper handling of nullable integers during aggregation to avoid the TypeError.
2. Adjust the logic in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to correctly handle nullable integers when performing aggregation operations.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.convert(numeric_only=True)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        
        if isinstance(result, pd.DataFrame):
            result = result.to_numpy()
        
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    for idx, blk in enumerate(agg_blocks):
        blk.mgr_locs = BlockPlacement(slice(idx, idx+1, 1))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected code aims to properly handle nullable integers and ensure correct aggregation without causing a TypeError. It converts the data to numeric if needed and aggregates the blocks appropriately before returning the results.
