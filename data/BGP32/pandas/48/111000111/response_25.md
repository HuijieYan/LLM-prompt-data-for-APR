## Bug Analysis
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is responsible for aggregating data in a DataFrameGroupBy object. It is apparent from the function that it is meant to process numeric data blocks for aggregation.
2. The bug likely lies in handling exceptions related to not being able to perform the aggregation operation, especially when `alt` is None. This situation is specific to the 'ohlc' case.
3. The bug causes problems when handling object dtype blocks and splitting them into multiple blocks, leading to incorrect results or errors in aggregation.
4. To fix the bug, the exception handling and split block logic need to be revised to address the scenario when an alternate aggregation method is not available.
  
## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Implement a check to validate if an alternate aggregation method (specified by `alt`) is provided or not when needed.
2. Handle cases where the aggregation operation cannot be performed using the default method (e.g., 'ohlc') by either skipping the block or applying the alternate method.
3. Address the split block scenario properly to avoid aggregating incorrect data or encountering errors.
4. Ensure that the function returns the expected output based on the input parameters and the bug description provided in the GitHub issue.

## Bug Fix
Below is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function that addresses the identified issues:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt: Callable = None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = None
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                # Exclude the block if alt method is not available
                if how == "ohlc":
                    continue
            else:
                # Use the alternate method for aggregation
                obj = self.obj.iloc[locs]
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                if isinstance(result, DataFrame) and len(result._data.blocks) == 1:
                    result = cast(DataFrame, result)
                    result = result._data.blocks[0].values

        if result is not None:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            
            # Prepare the aggregation block
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
    
    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
    
    # Update the location indexes
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))
    
    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : offset + loc]
        offset += loc
    
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By applying this fix, the function should handle the aggregation of data appropriately and produce the expected results as described in the GitHub issue.
