## Bug Analysis
The bug arises when calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy object with Int64 dtype. The error is triggered due to an incompatibility with the nullable integer data type while performing aggregation operations like mean, median, and std.

## Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is responsible for performing aggregation operations on the grouped data. The error occurs when calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy object with Int64 dtype due to compatibility issues with the nullable integer data type. The issue leads to a TypeError being raised during the aggregation process.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the compatibility between the nullable integer data type and aggregations like mean, median, and std. This can be achieved by ensuring proper type handling within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

## Bug Fix
Here is a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function that addresses the compatibility issue with the nullable integer data type:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue                
            
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]    
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
                
        block_dtype = block.dtype
        if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and block_dtype.name == "Int64":
            result = result.astype("float64")

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset: offset + loc]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version ensures that the result is properly handled to accommodate the nullable integer data type during aggregation operations like mean. The type conversion to float64 is used as a workaround to address the compatibility issue.

By applying this fix, the TypeError when calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype should be resolved. The function now correctly handles the aggregation operations for nullable integer data types.
