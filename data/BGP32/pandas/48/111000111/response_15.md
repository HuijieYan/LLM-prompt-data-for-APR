### Analysis:
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is intended to aggregate data using specified methods like mean, median, std, etc., based on certain conditions. The bug seems to be related to how the data is being processed and aggregated. The error reported in the GitHub issue is also related to the incorrect behavior of the `mean` function for a `DataFrameGroupBy` with Int64 dtype.

### Identified Issue:
The bug is likely due to improper handling of the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) during aggregation, causing a TypeError. The function `_cython_agg_blocks` needs to handle the nullable integer data type properly to avoid such errors.

### Suggested Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the function can handle nullable integer data type (`Int64`) appropriately during aggregation.
2. Make sure the result after aggregation aligns with the expected output provided in the GitHub issue.
3. Check for any inconsistencies or issues with handling different data types during aggregation.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array.copy())
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    new_loc = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.argsort(new_loc))

    for index, blk in enumerate(agg_blocks):
        blk.mgr_locs = BlockPlacement(new_loc[index:(index+1)])

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version should address the issue related to handling nullable integer data types (`Int64`) properly during aggregation.

### Note:
Make sure to test the corrected function with the provided test cases to verify that it behaves as expected and resolves the reported issue.
