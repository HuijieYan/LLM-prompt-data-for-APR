### Bug Analysis
- The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is responsible for performing aggregation on the data based on the given parameters.
- The bug could potentially be related to the calculated `result` values or the handling of different block types during aggregation.
- The GitHub issue mentions a TypeError when calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with an `Int64` dtype, which could be related to the buggy function.

### Bug Cause
- The bug might be caused by incorrect handling of the `Int64` data type during aggregation in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.
- The issue reported on GitHub specifically points out problems with the `mean` function, which suggests there might be a type-related issue when performing the aggregation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the aggregation process correctly handles the `Int64` data type.
- Validate the data type conversion and casting operations to handle `Int64` dtype properly during aggregation.
- Verify the aggregation logic to avoid any type-related errors when performing operations like mean, median, var, etc., on the data.

### Updated Corrected Function
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=self.axis, min_count=min_count
        )

        if not isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = BlockPlacement(np.arange(offset, offset + loc))
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

### Conclusion
- The updated function should resolve the issue related to aggregating with `Int64` data types and avoid the TypeError reported in the GitHub issue.
- By ensuring proper dtype handling throughout the aggregation process, the function should be able to correctly calculate aggregations like mean, median, etc., on the data.
