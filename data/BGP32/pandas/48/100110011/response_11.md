### Bug Analysis:
- The bug occurs when calling the `mean`, `median`, or `var` functions on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with nullable integer data type (`dtype='Int64'`).
- The error message indicates that there is an issue with casting from `float64` to `int64` due to non-equivalency.
- The failing test tries to compute the mean, median, or variance on a grouped DataFrame with nullable integer values.
- The failing function `_cython_agg_blocks` is involved in processing aggregation within the grouped DataFrame and handling data types.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug arises because the function `_cython_agg_blocks` does not correctly handle nullable integer data types when performing aggregation operations like mean, median, or variance.
- When trying to cast floating point values to integer values, it fails due to the presence of `NA` values which are not viable for conversion to integer directly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- We need to update the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to properly handle nullable integer data types when performing aggregation operations.
- Specifically, we need to address the issue of casting floating point values to integer values considering the presence of `NA` values in the data.
- A robust solution involves checking and handling the `NA` values appropriately during the aggregation process to ensure a successful conversion from float to integer.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        
        # Check if result contains any NA values
        if result.isna().any():
            agg_block = block.make_block(result, placement=block.mgr_locs)
        else:
            if how in ("mean", "median", "var"):
                result = result.astype(float)  # Ensure conversion to float for safe casting
        
            # Perform aggregation and downcast
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
            maybe_downcast_numeric(agg_block, block.dtype)

        new_items.append(agg_block.mgr_locs)

        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function properly handles nullable integer data types when aggregating data in a `DataFrameGroupBy` object. It includes specific checks to handle NA values and ensures proper casting for safe aggregation operations like mean, median, and variance. This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
