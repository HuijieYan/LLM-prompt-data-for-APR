### Bug Analysis:
- The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is a core part of the groupby functionality in Pandas.
- The error message suggests a type casting issue from `float64` to `int64` which is causing a `TypeError`.
- The failing test cases involve calling functions like `mean`, `median`, and `var` on nullable integer data, leading to the same error.
- The GitHub issue also indicates the same problem occurring when calling `mean` after grouping on a DataFrame with `Int64` dtype.

### Error Cause:
- The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` appears to be processing grouping and aggregation operations on the DataFrame.
- During the processing, there is a situation where a type casting operation from `float` to `int` is attempted which is resulting in the `TypeError`.
- This mismatch between float and int types is likely causing the issue with functions like `mean`, `median`, and `var`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To resolve the issue, we need to ensure that any potential type casting situations from `float` to `int` are handled correctly or avoided.
- Specifically, when aggregating the data within the `_cython_agg_blocks`, we need to handle the casting properly to prevent the TypeError.
- We can modify the code to ensure that the result of any calculations is consistently of the expected type, especially when dealing with nullable integers.

### Corrected Function:

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the _cython_agg_blocks function
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = block.to_numeric().groupby(self.grouper).agg(how).values
        agg_block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(agg_block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
        
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.concatenate(new_items))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By modifying the code to ensure a proper type conversion and aggregation, we should be able to fix the issue with the casting error.

Feel free to modify the function further based on specific requirements or additional test cases.
