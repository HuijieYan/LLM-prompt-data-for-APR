### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is responsible for performing aggregation operations on grouped data.
2. The error message indicates a `TypeError` during casting from `float64` to `int64`.
3. The GitHub issue describes a similar scenario where calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype results in a `TypeError`.
4. The function fails for various aggregation functions like `mean`, `median`, and `var`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by attempting to cast non-equivalent `float64` values to `int64` during the aggregation operation. This issue arises due to differences in data types between the result and the target dtype.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that before casting the aggregation result, we check the compatibilty between the current dtype and the target dtype. Additionally, we should handle the casting in a way that respects the data type constraints.

### Proposed Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    no_result = object()

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result = no_result

        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                # Exclude the block if we cannot perform the operation in an alternate way
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, block.dtype)  # Handle dtype casting

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
            new_items.append(locs)

    if not (agg_blocks or deleted_items):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Rest of the function remains the same

    return agg_blocks, data.items.take(np.sort(np.concatenate(new_items)))
```

This fix adds a check to handle dtype casting properly before creating the aggregation block. It ensures that the result is compatible with the target dtype to avoid `TypeError` during casting.

With this corrected version, the function should now properly handle the aggregation operation without causing casting errors.

### Note:
Ensure to test this corrected version with the failing test cases to confirm that the bug has been successfully resolved.
