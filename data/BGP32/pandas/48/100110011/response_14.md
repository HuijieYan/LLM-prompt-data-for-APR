### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is responsible for aggregating blocks based on certain criteria, and the bug causes a `TypeError` when attempting to cast non-equivalent float64 values to int64.
2. The failing test `test_apply_to_nullable_integer_returns_float` triggers this bug by testing aggregation functions like mean, median, and var on DataFrames with nullable integer values.
3. The error message indicates a failure in casting float64 to int64, which aligns with the reported issue in the GitHub report regarding calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype causing a `TypeError`.
4. The bug seems to stem from incorrect handling of dtype conversion between float64 and int64 during aggregation operations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the dtype casting logic to handle conversions from float64 to int64 during aggregation.
2. Ensure that the aggregation operations adhere to the expected behavior with the nullable integer dtype.
3. Check for edge cases where float64 values need to be cast to int64 without losing precision.
4. Adjust the data processing steps in `_cython_agg_blocks` function to account for dtype conversion issues correctly.

### Bug Fix for `_cython_agg_blocks` Function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        
        # Handle dtype conversion for float64 to int64
        if isinstance(result, pd.Series) and result.dtype == "float64":
            if block.dtype == "Int64":
                result = result.astype("Int64")

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By incorporating the provided fix, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should now handle the conversion from float64 to Int64 dtype when necessary, resolving the issue with the failing test and aligning with the reported problem in the GitHub issue.
