### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` in the file `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` is causing a `TypeError` due to inappropriate type casting when aggregating data using the `mean`, `median`, or `var` functions.
2. The error occurs when aggregating integer values stored in a nullable integer column.
3. The GitHub issue #32219 describes a similar problem, where calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype results in a `TypeError`.
4. The error message indicates that `values.astype(dtype, casting="safe")` within the `safe_cast` function causes the issue when trying to cast from `float64` to `int64`.
  
### Bug Explanation:
1. When the `mean` function is applied to a `DataFrameGroupBy` object on a column with `Int64` dtype, the internal type casting operation from `float64` to `int64` fails.
2. The error is triggered by calling the `_cython_agg_blocks` function with inappropriate casting rules, leading to a `TypeError` during type conversion.
  
### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the type casting within `safe_cast` to handle the conversion from `float64` to `int64` appropriately to resolve the type conversion issue.
2. Ensure that the casting rules align with the data types being handled to prevent any casting errors during aggregation.
3. Implement a safe conversion mechanism to handle nullable integer values appropriately during the aggregation process.
  
### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # existing code here...

    for block in data.blocks:
        # existing code here...
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        # existing code here...

        if result is not no_result and not isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            # existing code here...
            if result is not no_result:
                # existing code here...

                # update the type casting to handle nullable integer values
                casted_result = maybe_convert_objects(result, try_float=True)
                casted_result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(casted_result, dtype=block.dtype)

                agg_block: Block = block.make_block(casted_result)

                # existing code here...
```

By updating the type casting logic within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to properly handle nullable integer values and ensure compatible type conversions during aggregation, the bug causing the `TypeError` should be resolved.
