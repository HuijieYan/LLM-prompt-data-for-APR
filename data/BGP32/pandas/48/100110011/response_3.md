## Bug Analysis:
1. The failing test triggers an error related to casting float64 to int64 when applying certain aggregation functions on grouped DataFrames with Int64 dtype columns.
2. The error is related to the function `_cython_agg_blocks`, specifically when performing the casting operation in the block inside the function.
3. The bug causes a `TypeError` when trying to cast non-equivalent float64 to int64, as the function is not handling the data types correctly during aggregation.
4. The strategy for fixing the bug involves properly handling the casting of different data types in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

## Bug Fix:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        # existing code here...

        except TypeError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if isinstance(obj, np.ndarray):
                obj = pd.Series(obj)

            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
```

In the provided fix, when encountering the `TypeError` during aggregation, the code checks if the object is an instance of `np.ndarray` and converts it to a `pd.Series`. This conversion helps in handling the casting operation correctly during aggregation, avoiding the `TypeError` related to non-equivalent casting.
