Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test cases, the bug seems to be related to the handling of the `Numeric` data type in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function of the DataFrameGroupBy class in pandas.

### Bug Explanation:
- The bug occurs when applying certain aggregation functions (`mean`, `median`, `var`) to a DataFrameGroupBy object with `Int64` data type columns.
- The bug leads to a `TypeError` when trying to perform aggregation operations on this specific data type in the mentioned functions.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- The issue arises due to the inconsistency in handling the `Int64` data type during aggregation operations.
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `Int64` data type is properly handled during aggregation operations in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.convert_to_continuous()

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        
        if result is None:
            deleted_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
            continue

        result = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(result)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    return agg_blocks, data.items

```

After fixing the bug, the corrected function should now handle the `Int64` data type properly during aggregation and should pass the failing test cases.

Let me know if you need further assistance with this bug fix!
