Based on the analysis of the provided code and the failing test cases, we can see that the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is experiencing issues when trying to aggregate numeric data. The main problem seems to be in the handling of `Int64` datatype in the `df` DataFrame, which leads to errors during grouping and aggregation operations like `mean`, `median`, and `var`.

To address the bug and resolve the issue reported on GitHub, we need to ensure that the `_cython_agg_blocks` function can handle nullable integer data correctly during aggregation operations.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self _get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.transform(block, how=how)
        agg_block = block.make_block(result)
        
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    agg_items = data.items

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version:
- We have removed unnecessary variables and lists like `deleted_items`, `split_items`, and `split_frames`.
- The main fix is in the aggregation process where we now directly transform each block with the grouped operation using `self.grouper.transform`.
- We are correctly appending the `mgr_locs` and the transformed block to the respective lists.

This corrected version should handle the grouping and aggregation operations on nullable integer data correctly, as expected in the test cases provided.
