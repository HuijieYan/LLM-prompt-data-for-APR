### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is part of the class `DataFrameGroupBy` which inherits from `GroupBy`.
2. The function is responsible for aggregating blocks based on certain criteria like `how` (e.g., mean, median) and `numeric_only` flag.
3. The buggy function seems to be encountering TypeError when aggregating with certain functions such as mean, median, var on nullable integer data.
4. The GitHub issue highlights a similar problem where calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype results in TypeError.
5. The issue seems to stem from the handling of nullable integers in aggregation operations.

### Bug:
The bug appears to be related to the handling of nullable integer data types during the aggregation process. The error occurs when applying mean, median, and var functions to nullable integer data within a DataFrameGroupBy object.

### Strategy for Bug Fix:
1. The bug seems to arise due to the interaction between nullable integer data and the aggregation operations. We need to make sure that the aggregation logic is compatible with nullable integer data types.
2. One potential fix could involve handling nullable integer data conversions and operations properly within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to avoid TypeError.

### Updated Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=self.axis, min_count=min_count
        )
        # Ensure result is not a DataFrame
        if isinstance(result, pd.DataFrame):
            result = result.values

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    # Update the locs in the blocks
    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset: offset + loc]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This version should handle the aggregation logic for nullable integer data types appropriately and avoid the TypeError.
