The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is related to the handling of DataFrameGroupBy operations on nullable integer dtypes. The bug causes a TypeError when trying to calculate the mean after grouping using `Int64` dtype.

### Analysis:
1. The `_cython_agg_blocks` function in the DataFrameGroupBy class processes numeric data blocks and performs aggregation operations.
2. The bug occurs when trying to calculate the mean value after grouping on a DataFrame with `Int64` dtype.
3. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the problem with calling the mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with `Int64` dtype, resulting in a TypeError.
4. The bug is in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, affecting the calculation of aggregation blocks and resulting in incorrect output when mean is used on nullable integer columns.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of Nullable Integer dtype when aggregating data in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. The issue arises due to the specific implementation of mean calculation for nullable integers.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure proper handling of nullable integer dtype during aggregation operations.
2. Check for the presence of nullable values and adapt the aggregation logic accordingly.
3. Convert nullable integer dtypes to appropriate numeric data types before aggregation.

### Code Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function that addresses the issue:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.convert_dtypes()

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    for block in data.blocks:
        if block.is_integer():
            result = self.obj.groupby(self.grouper.group_index).transform(how).iloc[:, block.mgr_locs.as_array]
        else:
            result = block.values

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    agg_items = data.items

    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.argsort(indexer))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By applying the fix above, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should now correctly handle aggregation operations on DataFrameGroupBy objects with nullable integer data, resolving the TypeError issue when calculating the mean.
