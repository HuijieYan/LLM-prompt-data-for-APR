After analyzing the buggy function and the issue reported on GitHub, it appears that the problem arises when calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` dtype. The bug results in a `TypeError`.

The bug seems to occur in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. The issue is most likely related to the handling of the nullable integer data type (`Int64` dtype) during aggregation.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper handling of the `Int64` dtype data when applying aggregation functions. We can make adjustments to correctly handle the nullable integer data type and avoid the `TypeError` that occurs during the calculation of mean, median, and variance.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.convert(numeric_only=True)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array

        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            result = s.agg(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)

        new_items.append(np.array([agg_block.mgr_locs]))
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    items = np.concatenate(new_items)
    indexer = np.argsort(np.hstack(items))

    for i, blk in enumerate(agg_blocks):
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = BlockPlacement(indexer[offset : (offset + loc)])
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, data.items.take(indexer)
```

This corrected function should now handle the `Int64` dtype properly during aggregation, and the `TypeError` issue should be resolved. The function should now pass the failing test case provided.

Please test the corrected function thoroughly to ensure that it behaves as expected and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
