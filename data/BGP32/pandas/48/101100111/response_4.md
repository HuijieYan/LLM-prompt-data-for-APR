Based on the provided information, the bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is causing a TypeError when calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype. The issue is related to the handling of Int64 data type in the grouping operation.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the Int64 dtype during aggregation. One possible strategy is to explicitly convert the Int64 dtype to a numeric type that is compatible with the aggregation operations.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        values = block.values
        # Convert Int64 data to float for aggregation
        if isinstance(values, pd.array.IntegerArray):
            values = values.astype(float)

        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )
        
        result = maybe_convert_objects(result)

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    agg_items = data.items.take(np.concatenate(new_items))
  
    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected function ensures that Int64 data is explicitly converted to a compatible data type (float) before aggregation, avoiding the TypeError issue.

Please test this corrected version with the failing test cases to ensure that it resolves the bug and passes all the test scenarios. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
