Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is related to the block merging process and the handling of input data types during aggregation. The issue is specifically pointed out in the GitHub issue where calling mean on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype results in a TypeError. 

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the aggregation process can handle the `Int64` data type correctly. We can do this by adjusting the way the data is processed and ensuring that the types are compatible throughout the function.

Here is a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function based on the analysis and the expected variable values:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result)
            agg_block: Block = make_block(result)

            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    if split_items:
        for locs, result in zip(split_items, split_frames):
            for i, loc in enumerate(locs):
                new_items.append(np.array([loc], dtype=locs.dtype))
                agg_blocks.append(result.iloc[:, [i]]._data.blocks[0])

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = BlockPlacement(slice(offset, offset + loc, 1))
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version should handle the `Int64` data type correctly during the aggregation process and address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.

Make sure to test this corrected function with the failing tests provided to verify that it now passes the expected input/output values and resolves the bug.
