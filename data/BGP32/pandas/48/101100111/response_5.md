The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is related to the TypeError occurring when calling the mean function on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype, as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Analysis:
The bug seems to be related to handling Int64 dtype data when calling mean, median, or std functions on a DataFrameGroupBy object.

The function `_cython_agg_blocks` is designed to aggregate data based on specific inputs like how, numeric_only, and min_count. However, the bug occurs when the input data contains Int64 dtype columns and certain operations are performed on it.

The issue might be with the operation of computing the result when dealing with the Int64 data type in the DataFrame.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug, we may need to ensure that the operations performed on the Int64 columns are compatible and correctly handle the nullable integer datatype.

### Bug Fix Implementation:
Here is a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function that should address the bug:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
        # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
        for block in data.blocks:
            if isinstance(block.values, pd.arrays.IntegerArray):
                block_values = block.values.to_numpy()
            else:
                block_values = block.values
            
            agg_result = block_values.mean() if how == 'mean' else block_values.median()
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(agg_result)
            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # Rest of the function remains the same

    return agg_blocks, self._get_data_to_aggregate().items.take(np.concatenate(new_items))
```

This corrected version ensures that the mean and median calculations are handled appropriately when dealing with Int64 dtype columns, including the nullable integer case.

Please test this corrected function with the failing test cases provided to ensure that the bug is fixed and the expected results are achieved.
