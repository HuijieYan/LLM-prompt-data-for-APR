## Analysis and Explanation:
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is failing due to an exception raised while calling `result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))`. This exception occurs when trying to aggregate a column of nullable integer data type using the `mean`, `median`, or `var` functions.

The issue is related to `ExtensionBlock` and `Int64` data types. The function fails to handle the nullable integer data type correctly during aggregation, leading to a `TypeError`. The bug is related to conversion issues between nullable integers and regular integers in the aggregation process.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the nullable integer data type is handled correctly during aggregation operations. By adjusting the way the function handles nullable integers and converting them appropriately during aggregation, we can resolve the issue.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=self.axis, min_count=min_count)
        
        # Handle nullable integer data type in aggregation
        if not isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result, convert_numeric=True)

        result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result)
        if block.dtype.kind == "O":
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    return agg_blocks, data.items.take(np.concatenate(new_items))
```

This corrected version includes additional checks and conversions to handle nullable integer data types correctly during aggregation. This modification should resolve the issue and ensure the function works properly with nullable integer data types.
