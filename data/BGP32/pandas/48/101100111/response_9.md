The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function seems to arise from an issue with the aggregation of nullable integer dtype columns in a DataFrameGroupBy object.

Here's an analysis and corrective approach for the function:

1. Analysis of the buggy function:
   - The `_cython_agg_blocks` function is responsible for aggregating data in a DataFrameGroupBy object.
   - The issue seems to stem from the interaction with nullable integer dtype columns when using aggregation functions such as mean, median, and var.

2. Potential error locations:
   - The `for block in data.blocks` loop may be problematic when handling nullable integer dtype values.

3. Cause of the bug:
   - The bug is likely related to the handling of nullable integer dtype columns during aggregation, leading to a TypeError when mean, median, or var is called on nullable integer columns.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
   - Check the implementation of the aggregation logic to correctly handle nullable integer dtype.
   - Ensure that operations involving nullable integer columns are correctly handled to avoid TypeError.

5. Correction to the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":

    # Get the data to aggregate
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    # Handling numeric_only flag
    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    # Define lists to store aggregated blocks, locs, and other variables
    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    # Iterate over blocks in data
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array

        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )

            # Handle result
            if result is not no_result:
                result = maybe_convert_objects(result, block.skipped)
                result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

                agg_block: Block = make_block(result)
                new_items.append(locs)
                agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is not None:
                # Perform the operation using alt function for non-numeric
                obj = self.obj[block.mgr_locs.indexer]
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                result = cast(DataFrame, result)

                # Handle DataFrame result
                if len(result._data.blocks) == 1:
                    split_items.append(locs)
                    split_frames.append(result)
        
    # Handle split block cleanup
    if split_items:
        for locs, result in zip(split_items, split_frames):
            for i, loc in enumerate(locs):
                new_items.append(np.array([loc], dtype=locs.dtype))
                agg_blocks.append(result.iloc[:, [i]]._data.blocks[0])

    # Reset locs in the blocks
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    # Return the aggregated blocks and items
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version aims to correctly handle the aggregation of nullable integer dtype columns in the DataFrameGroupBy object, ensuring that mean, median, and var functions work as expected.

Please replace the existing `_cython_agg_blocks` function with this corrected version. Make sure to test it against the failing test cases to ensure the bug is fixed.
