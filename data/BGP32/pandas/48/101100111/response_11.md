## Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. The issue arises from an incorrect condition check for `TypeError` exception handling, which leads to exclusion of blocks when certain functions like 'mean', 'median', and 'var' are called.

- The bug appears when `how` is set to 'mean', 'median', or 'var' in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.
- The function tries to handle a `NotImplementedError` exception for certain functions but mistakenly uses a condition for `TypeError` handling, leading to the exclusion of blocks.
- This exclusion behavior results in incorrect output when trying to apply these functions on grouped data with nullable integers (Int64 dtype).

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, the condition and exception handling mechanism inside the `try-except` block for `NotImplementedError` should be corrected. The function should properly handle the grouping and aggregation for the mean, median, and var functions without excluding blocks unnecessarily based on the wrong exception type.

## Bug Fix:
After correcting the issue based on the analysis above, here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                raise
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
        
        if result is not no_result:
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Further code remains the same as the original function for reshaping and returning results

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By correcting the exception handling and condition checking in the function, it should now properly aggregate the data without excluding blocks unnecessarily and provide the correct output when functions like 'mean', 'median', and 'var' are called on grouped data with nullable integers (Int64 dtype).
