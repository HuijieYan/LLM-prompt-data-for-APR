## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` file.
2. The function is intended to aggregate blocks based on certain conditions, but it fails to do so, resulting in `TypeError` when calling `mean` with `Int64` dtype.
3. The cause of the bug lies in the aggregation process when dealing with nullable integers.
4. To fix the bug, the handling of nullable integers during aggregation needs to be adjusted.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check the specific blocks where the issue with nullable integers arises.
2. Modify the aggregation process to handle nullable integers correctly.
3. Ensure compatibility with different aggregation methods like `mean`, `median`, and `var`.

## Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1)
        -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
        
        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
        
        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
        for block in data.blocks:
            locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
        
        agg_items = data.items
        indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
        agg_items = agg_items.take(indexer)
        
        for i, blk in enumerate(agg_blocks):
            blk.mgr_locs = BlockPlacement(slice(i, i+1, 1))
        
        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version addresses the issue with nullable integers during aggregation in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. It ensures proper handling of nullable integers when performing aggregation operations like `mean`, `median`, and `var`.
