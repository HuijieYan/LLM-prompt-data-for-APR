The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is related to an issue where calling certain aggregation functions on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype resulted in a TypeError. 

The bug is caused by the way the function handles the aggregation process. It fails to properly aggregate numeric data when using the `mean`, `median`, or `var` functions. This bug leads to incorrect output and raised exceptions.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the aggregation process correctly handles the nullable integer data type and performs the aggregation functions as expected.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(self, how: str, alt = None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.convert(numeric_only=True, copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                # we cannot perform the operation in an alternate way, exclude the block
                assert how == "ohlc"
                continue
            else:
                result = block.agg(alt, axis=self.axis)

        agg_blocks.append(block.make_block(result))
        new_items.append(locs)

    if not (agg_blocks or new_items):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    agg_items = data.items.take(np.concatenate(new_items))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By properly converting the data to numeric types and ensuring that the aggregation process is handled correctly, the corrected function should now work as expected and pass the failing test cases.
