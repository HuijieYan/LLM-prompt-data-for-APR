The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is currently failing due to issues with the aggregation process. Specifically, there are problems related to the calculation and assignment of results within the function, leading to incorrect behavior.

To address the problem, we first need to correct the calculation of the aggregation result within the loop that processes each block. Additionally, we need to ensure proper handling of different data types and shapes that may arise during aggregation.

Below is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))

            result = cast(DataFrame, result)
            result_values = result.values

            if result_values.shape[1] == 1:
                result_values = result_values.reshape(1, -1)

        else:
            result_values = result

        result_values = maybe_downcast_numeric(result_values, block.dtype)

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result_values)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    aggregator_locs = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(aggregator_locs))

    # Update the locs to account for removed items
    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        indexer = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        aggregator_locs = (indexer - mask.cumsum())[aggregator_locs]

    offset = 0
    for agg_block in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(agg_block.mgr_locs)
        agg_block.mgr_locs = BlockPlacement(slice(offset, offset + loc, 1))
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version addresses the issues with the aggregation process and ensures proper handling of different scenarios that may occur during the aggregation of blocks.

The corrected function should now pass the failing tests and produce the expected output values for all the given test cases.
