## Analysis
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the `pandas` library. This function is responsible for aggregating data using an aggregation function (`how`) and returning the aggregated blocks. During the aggregation process, it handles various cases including splitting object-dtype blocks and aggregating numeric data.

The bug in the function is causing incorrect results when computing the aggregation for certain cases, leading to failures in the provided test cases.

## Bug Explanation
The main issue in the code arises when the function computes the aggregation result in cases where an alternate aggregation method (`alt`) should be used, typically when an operation is not applicable for numeric data. In these cases, the code wrongly falls back to the default aggregation method instead of applying the provided alternate function `alt`.

This leads to incorrect results being computed and therefore failing the test cases that expect specific aggregated values.

## Proposed Fix
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when an operation is not applicable for the data, the function uses the provided alternate function `alt` for aggregation. This involves correctly handling the cases where `NotImplementedError` is raised after trying the default aggregation.

The corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                raise NotImplementedError("Alternate function 'alt' is required for aggregation.")

            obj = self.obj[block.items[0]]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))

        assert not isinstance(result, DataFrame)

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                result, _ = maybe_convert_objects(result, dtype=block.dtype)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version ensures that the alternate aggregation function `alt` is used when an operation is not applicable for a specific block.

With this fix, the function should now correctly aggregate the data according to the specified function and pass the failing test cases provided.
