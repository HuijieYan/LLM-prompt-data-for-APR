## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is used to aggregate blocks of data within a `DataFrameGroupBy` object. The function loops through the blocks in the data, applies aggregation functions based on the `how` parameter, and constructs new blocks to store the aggregated data.

The bug in this function could stem from the way it processes blocks in the data and aggregates them. There are multiple potential locations for errors, such as handling different data types, issues with creating new blocks, or incorrect indexing.

## Bug Cause
The bug in the function is likely due to an issue with how the function is aggregating data to generate new blocks in certain scenarios, such as when splitting object-dtype blocks or encountering exceptions during aggregation.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the aggregation process is correctly handling different data types, splitting blocks, and creating new blocks. We should also address any exceptions that may occur during the aggregation process.

## Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array

        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            result = self._python_agg_block(block, how, alt, min_count)
        
        # Ensure the result is not a DataFrame
        assert not isinstance(result, DataFrame)

        if result is not None:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                result = type(block.values)._from_sequence(
                    result.ravel(), dtype=block.dtype
                )

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    # Update the locs in the agg_blocks
    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version of the function includes handling the aggregation process more robustly and ensuring correct block creation and handling of exceptions. The function should now properly aggregate the blocks within the `DataFrameGroupBy` object.
