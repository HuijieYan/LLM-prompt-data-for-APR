The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks()` has issues in handling the aggregation for DataFrameGroupBy objects. The function needs to correctly aggregate the data based on the specified method ('how') and axis. It also needs to handle cases where the aggregation results in float values. The current implementation has some errors that need to be fixed.

The main issues in the buggy function:
1. Incorrect aggregation logic: The function is not correctly aggregating the data based on the specified method ('how') and axis. This is leading to incorrect results.
2. Incorrect handling of float values: When aggregating data that results in floats, the function is not properly converting the results to a valid block format.

To correct the issues:
1. Check the grouper object and how it aggregates the data in the GroupBy object.
2. Ensure that the aggregation results are properly handled and converted to the appropriate block format.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks()` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Handle if aggregation is not supported
            continue
        
        if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
            result = result.reshape(1, -1)

        agg_block: Block = make_block(result, placement=block.mgr_locs)

        new_items.append(np.array([block.mgr_locs[0]]))
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for agg_block in agg_blocks:
        size = len(agg_block.mgr_locs)
        agg_block.mgr_locs = BlockPlacement(slice(offset, offset + size))
        offset += size

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version of the function should handle the aggregation properly and ensure that the results are correctly processed and converted to the expected block format.

Please replace the existing `_cython_agg_blocks()` function with this corrected version and re-run the test cases to verify the functionality.
