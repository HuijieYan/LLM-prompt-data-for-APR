The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` has several bugs that need to be addressed. The main issue is related to handling aggregation for object-dtype blocks. The function is not correctly aggregating data when encountering object-dtype blocks. 

One potential reason for the bug is how the function deals with object-dtype blocks during aggregation. The function assumes a single block input will return a single block output, which might not be the case when object-dtype blocks are involved.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that object-dtype blocks are handled correctly during aggregation and that the function can process them properly. We also need to handle splitting object-dtype blocks into multiple blocks if necessary.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            # call our grouper again with only this block
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            else:
                result = cast(DataFrame, result)
                
                if len(result._data.blocks) > 1:
                    result = result.stack()
                else:
                    result = result._data.blocks[0].values

        if not isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            if block.is_extension:
                result = maybe_convert_objects(result, block.values)

            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    agg_items = data.items.take(np.concatenate(new_items))

    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = BlockPlacement(slice(offset, offset + loc, 1))
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version handles object-dtype blocks correctly during aggregation and deals with cases where a single block input might result in multiple blocks in the output.

By updating the function in this way, it should now pass the failing test cases and produce the expected output for each scenario.
