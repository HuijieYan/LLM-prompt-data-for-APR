### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is causing incorrect aggregation results which fail the provided test cases. The primary issue lies in the aggregation logic and block management within the function.

The key problem areas in the function are:
1. Improper aggregation handling for non-numeric data types.
2. Incorrect management of blocks and items during the aggregation process.
3. Mistakes in constructing the final aggregation results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, the following steps need to be taken:
1. Ensure correct aggregation for both numeric and non-numeric data types.
2. Properly manage the blocks and items throughout the aggregation process.
3. Construct the final aggregation results accurately.

### Bug-fix Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function with the bug fixes applied:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        
        try:
            # Perform aggregation based on the specified 'how' method
            if block.is_extension:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
            else:
                result = block.apply(lambda x: getattr(x, how)())
        except (NotImplementedError, TypeError) as e:
            if alt is not None:
                # Call the alternative function for aggregation
                result = block.apply(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            else:
                # Exclude the block if there is no alternate method
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            
        if result is not no_result:
            # Create a new Block with the aggregated result
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
    
    # Construct the final aggregation blocks and items
    # based on the processed data
    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    # Adjust the indexer to account for removed items
    for deleted in deleted_items:
        indexer = np.where(np.isin(indexer, deleted), -1, indexer)
        indexer = np.unique(np.clip(indexer, -1, None))
    
    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By applying these bug fixes, the corrected `_cython_agg_blocks` function should now handle the aggregation correctly and pass the failing test cases provided.
