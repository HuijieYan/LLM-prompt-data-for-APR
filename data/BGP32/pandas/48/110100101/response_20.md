### Analysis:
1. The `_cython_agg_blocks` function is part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class, which is a subclass of `GroupBy`.
2. The function is responsible for computing aggregation blocks from the data based on a specified function (`how`).
3. The function iterates over the blocks of data, applies the aggregation function, and creates new aggregation blocks.
4. There are multiple lists used to store intermediate results: `agg_blocks`, `new_items`, `deleted_items`, `split_items`, and `split_frames`.
5. The issue seems to be related to the construction of `new_items` where only the first row of each block is appended. This causes incorrect shaping of the final result.
6. A correction strategy involves ensuring all rows from each block are considered in the aggregation step, as they would impact the final result.

### Bug Fix:
Here is a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
  
    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                # we cannot perform the operation
                # in an alternate way, exclude the block
                assert how == "ohlc"
                continue

            # call our grouper again with only this block
            obj = self.obj.iloc[locs]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                continue

        result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By ensuring that all rows in each block are considered during the aggregation step, the corrected function should now produce the correct results and pass the failing test cases.
