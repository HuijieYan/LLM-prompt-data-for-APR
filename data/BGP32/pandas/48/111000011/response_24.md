## Analysis:
The bug occurs when calling `.mean()` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with Int64 dtype data. The issue is related to type casting errors within the `_cython_agg_blocks` method of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class.

## Error Locations:
1. The bug might be associated with the data type casting and handling within the function.
2. Errors might occur during the aggregation process when dealing with different data types.
3. Inability to handle nullable integer data type (Int64) during mean aggregation.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by incorrect handling of nullable integer data type (Int64) within the `_cython_agg_blocks` method of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. When calling `.mean()` on a grouped DataFrame with Int64 dtype, type casting errors occur, leading to a TypeError.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper handling of nullable integer data type (Int64) during aggregation operations. This involves checking for Int64 dtype data and performing appropriate type conversions to avoid errors when calling mean.

## Bug Fix:

Below is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` method of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        try:
            result = self.grouper.filter_indices_and_values(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Handle Int64 dtype for mean operation
            if block.dtype == np.int64 and how == 'mean':
                result = self.grouper.aggregate_int64(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
            else:
                raise  # Propagate the error
            
        # Create a block with the aggregated result
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    agg_items = data.items

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the fixed code:
- We have added a new check to handle the Int64 dtype specifically for mean operation within the try-except block.
- If the block has an Int64 dtype and the operation is mean, a custom method `aggregate_int64` is called to handle the mean operation for Int64 dtype.
- This ensures that mean operation on Int64 dtype data is handled correctly within the `_cython_agg_blocks` method.

By making these modifications, the bug related to calling mean on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with Int64 dtype should be fixed.
