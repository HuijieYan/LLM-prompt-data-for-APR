### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is a method within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class which extends `GroupBy` class.
- The purpose of the function is to aggregate data blocks while handling certain conditions based on the input parameters.
- The function seems to have a bug related to handling the nullable integer data type `Int64` in DataFrameGroupBy operations.
- The GitHub issue mentioned shows that calling `mean` after grouping results in a `TypeError` when using the `Int64` dtype.

### Bug Location:
- The bug might be related to the handling of the `Int64` dtype during aggregation in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.
- Specifically, there might be an issue in how the nullable integer data type `Int64` is processed in the aggregation.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs due to discrepancies in handling the nullable integer data type `Int64` in the aggregation process, leading to a `TypeError`.
- This issue arises when trying to perform aggregation operations, such as `mean`, on the data involving the `Int64` data type within the `DataFrameGroupBy`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the nullable integer data type `Int64` is handled correctly during aggregation operations.
- This may involve checking for specific conditions related to the `Int64` dtype and adapting the aggregation process accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    # Handling nullable integer type Int64 by checking dtype
    is_nullable_int64 = any(block.dtype == 'Int64' for block in data.blocks)
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Handling nullable integer type Int64
        if is_nullable_int64 and block.dtype == 'Int64':
            result = block.values.to_numpy(dtype=float)  # Convert Int64 to float for aggregation
        else:
            locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)  
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    agg_items = data.items
    # Reset locs in blocks to correspond to current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = agg_items.take(np.argsort(indexer))

    if not agg_blocks:  # If no valid aggregration, raise DataError
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
    
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

### Summary:
- In the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, special handling for the nullable integer type `Int64` is added.
- When encountering `Int64` dtype, the function converts it to float before performing aggregation to avoid `TypeError`.
- This modification should address the bug related to calling `mean` on `Int64` data within `DataFrameGroupBy`.
