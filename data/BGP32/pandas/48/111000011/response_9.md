### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks()` is part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` file.
- The function is responsible for aggregating data of different blocks in a groupby operation.
- The GitHub issue mentions that calling `.mean()` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` datatype results in a `TypeError`.
- The issue seems to be related to the handling of nullable integer data type (`Int64`) during aggregation.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is likely caused by the assumption that the data being aggregated is always numeric and can be directly used for aggregation operations.
- When `numeric_only` is set to `True`, the function attempts to extract only numeric data, expecting it to be suitable for aggregation.
- The issue arises when operation like `mean` is called on non-numeric (`Int64`) data, leading to a `TypeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Update the `_cython_agg_blocks()` function to handle nullable integer data type (`Int64`) gracefully during aggregation.
- Check the data type before performing aggregation operations to handle non-numeric cases appropriately.
- Adjust the logic to properly handle nullable integer data type during aggregation.

### Bug-fixed Version:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Check if the data block has numeric values
        if not block.is_numeric:
            continue

        # Handle nullable integer data type (Int64) separately
        if block.is_extension:
            if block.dtype_str == 'Int64':
                result = block.values.compute().astype('float64')
            else:
                result = block.values

        else:
            # Perform aggregation for other numeric blocks
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )

        # Create aggregation block
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # continue with existing logic for index adjustment and returning the results
```

### Summary:
- The bug stems from assuming that all data being aggregated is numeric, leading to errors with non-numeric (`Int64`) data.
- The bug fix involves explicitly handling nullable integer data type (`Int64`) during aggregation to avoid `TypeError`.
- The suggested corrected version of `_cython_agg_blocks()` function addresses the issue by detecting non-numeric data types and handling them accordingly.
