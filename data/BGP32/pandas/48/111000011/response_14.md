## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is a method defined in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class, a subclass of `GroupBy` in the `pandas` library.
2. The related functions called within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function are `get_groupby` and `maybe_downcast_numeric`.
3. The bug seems to be related to handling numeric data types within grouped data in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class, which results in a `TypeError` as reported in the GitHub issue.
4. The issue on GitHub provides a clear demonstration of the problem where using nullable integer data type (`Int64`) in a DataFrame and calling `mean()` after grouping results in a `TypeError`.
5. The explanation from the issue suggests that the bug exists when applying certain functions like `mean`, `median`, and `std` on grouped data with `Int64` dtype. The bug does not occur with functions like `min`, `max`, or `first`.
6. The Python version, `pandas` version, and related libraries versions mentioned in the issue are provided for reference.

## Bug Cause:
The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect handling of nullable integer data types (`Int64`) within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function when performing aggregation operations like `mean`, `median`, or `std` on grouped data.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the aggregation functions (`mean`, `median`, `std`, etc.) correctly handle nullable integer data types (`Int64`) within the grouped data in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. This may involve appropriate data type conversion or handling to avoid the `TypeError` reported in the GitHub issue.

## Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        if result is not None:
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result)
            agg_block: Block = make_block(result, klass=block.values.__class__)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[:loc]
        indexer = indexer[loc:]

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version ensures that the results obtained after aggregation are correctly converted back to the appropriate data types using the `maybe_convert_objects` function. Furthermore, it avoids the use of `maybe_downcast_numeric` which might be causing the issue with `Int64` data types.
