### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class which extends `GroupBy` class.
2. The function is responsible for performing aggregation on blocks of data within a `DataFrameGroupBy` object.
3. The issue reported on GitHub is related to calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` dtype which results in a `TypeError`.
4. The bug is likely related to the handling of nullable integer types (`Int64`) in the aggregation process.

### Bugs in the Buggy Function:
1. The bug might be related to the handling of nullable integer (`Int64`) dtype when performing aggregation.
2. Lack of proper handling for nullable integers while performing aggregation operations within the function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check for any specific handling needed for nullable integer dtypes when aggregating the data.
2. Update the aggregation logic to handle nullable integers correctly.
3. Ensure that the necessary checks are in place to avoid any TypeError related to nullable integer types.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        no_result = object()
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result = no_result
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None or self.obj.dtypes[block.mgr_locs[0]].name != "Int64":
                # Skip aggregation if alt is None or block dtype is Int64
                return [], self.grouper.result_index

        if not isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No valid types to aggregate")

    # Reset locs to correspond to current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    for i, blk in enumerate(agg_blocks):
        blk.mgr_locs = np.array([indexer[i]], dtype=locs.dtype)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

### Changes Made in the Corrected Version:
1. Added a check for `self.obj.dtypes[block.mgr_locs[0]].name != "Int64"` to skip aggregation if the block dtype is `Int64`.
2. Corrected the error checking logic and properly reset locs for aggregation blocks.

By implementing the suggested changes, the bug related to handling `Int64` dtypes during aggregation in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class should be resolved.
