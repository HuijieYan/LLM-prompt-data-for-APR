## Analysis:
1. The bug is related to calling the `mean()` function on a DataFrameGroupBy object with an `Int64` datatype, resulting in a TypeError.
2. The issue occurs when trying to aggregate the data using the `_cython_agg_blocks` function in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class.
3. The bug seems to be related to handling the `Int64` datatype column during aggregation.
4. The issue arises due to the `_cython_agg_blocks` function not handling the `Int64` datatype column correctly in the aggregation process.
5. To fix the bug, we need to update the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle the `Int64` datatype properly.

## Strategy:
1. Check for the `dtype` of the column being aggregated.
2. Handle the case where the column has an `Int64` datatype separately to avoid the TypeError.
3. Ensure that the `_cython_agg_blocks` function can properly handle the `Int64` datatype during aggregation.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected version of the _cython_agg_blocks function

def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        for block in data.blocks:
            locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
            try:
                if isinstance(block.dtype, pd.Int64Dtype):  # Check if the dtype is Int64
                    result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values.astype('float'), how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
                else:
                    result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
            except NotImplementedError:
                # Handle the exception
    
            # Rest of the code remains the same
    
        # Check remaining code as is
```

By updating the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle columns with `Int64` datatype separately by converting them to `float` before aggregation, we can resolve the TypeError issue when calling the `mean()` function on a DataFrameGroupBy object with an `Int64` datatype.
