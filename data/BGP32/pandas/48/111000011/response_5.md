### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class which inherits from `GroupBy`.
2. The function is responsible for performing aggregation on blocks of data based on certain conditions like `numeric_only` and `min_count`.
3. The issue described on GitHub is related to calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` dtype, resulting in a `TypeError`.
4. The bug leads to a `TypeError` because the implementation of `_cython_agg_blocks` does not handle the `Int64` dtype elegantly during aggregation.

### Error Locations:
1. The error is likely occurring when trying to aggregate data with `Int64` dtype in the `DataFrameGroupBy` object.
2. The code does not have specific handling for `Int64` dtype during aggregation, leading to the `TypeError`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the inability of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle the `Int64` dtype during aggregation, triggering a `TypeError` when calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to add specific handling for the `Int64` dtype during aggregation in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, allowing it to aggregate correctly without triggering a `TypeError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self._aggregate_block(block, how, alt, min_count)
        agg_blocks.append(result)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    return agg_blocks, data.items

def _aggregate_block(self, block: Block, how: str, alt, min_count: int):
    no_result = object()

    locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
    try:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )
    except NotImplementedError:
        return no_result

    if result is not no_result:
        result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

        if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
            try:
                result = type(block.values)._from_sequence(
                    result.ravel(), dtype=block.values.dtype
                )
            except ValueError:
                result = result.reshape(1, -1)

        return block.make_block(result)

    return None
```

In the corrected version:
- We introduced a helper method `_aggregate_block` to handle the aggregation process for each block.
- The helper method checks if the aggregation result is not `no_result`, downcasts numeric values, and adjusts the block if needed.
- The main `_cython_agg_blocks` function now loops over all blocks in the data, aggregates them using the helper method, and collects the result blocks for further processing.

This modification should address the handling of the `Int64` dtype during aggregation in the `DataFrameGroupBy` object, preventing the `TypeError` issue described in the GitHub problem.
