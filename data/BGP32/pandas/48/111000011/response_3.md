### Analysis:
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class of the `pandas.core.groupby.generic` module. The function is responsible for aggregating data within blocks based on specified criteria, but there are issues when handling nullable integer data types.

### Potential error location:
1. The error could be related to handling nullable integer data types (`Int64`) within the `result` variable. The code might not properly handle the aggregation of nullable integer data types.
2. There might be issues with the conditional statements related to handling non-numeric data types.

### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to be caused by the `cython_agg_blocks` function not handling nullable integer (`Int64`) data properly during aggregation. The code may not have appropriate checks or handling for nullable integer data types, leading to a `TypeError` when calling `mean` after grouping. This is evident from the GitHub issue indicating trouble with aggregating nullable integer data types.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the flow of data processing and handling within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to ensure correct handling of nullable integer data types.
2. Add conditional checks specific to handling nullable integer data types during aggregation operations.
3. Update the logic to correctly handle `Int64` data types during operations like mean, median, and std.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))

            for i, loc in enumerate(locs):
                new_items.append(np.array([loc], dtype=locs.dtype))
                agg_blocks.append(
                    block.make_block(cast(np.ndarray, result).ravel().reshape(1, -1))
                )

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Adjust the locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset:(offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By reviewing the nullable integer data type handling and ensuring proper aggregation logic, this corrected version should resolve the issue with aggregating nullable integer data types mentioned in the GitHub problem description.
