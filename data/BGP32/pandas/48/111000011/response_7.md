### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class, which is a subclass of `GroupBy`.
- The function is responsible for aggregating the data in a `DataFrameGroupBy` object based on the specified function (`how`), considering optional parameters like `numeric_only` and `min_count`.
- The bug described in the GitHub issue is related to calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` dtype, resulting in a `TypeError`.
- The issue seems to occur due to handling the aggregation operation in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, specifically the aggregation logic involving nullable integer data types.

### Error Cause:
- The bug is caused when the `maybe_downcast_numeric` function is applied to the aggregated result. Since the Nullable Integer data type is relatively new and may have different behaviors compared to standard numeric data types, this operation results in a `TypeError`.
- The code logic in `maybe_downcast_numeric` is not fully compatible with nullable integer data types, leading to the error.

### Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to update the handling of nullable integer data types in the aggregation process, specifically in casting the result back to the original dtype.
- We should enhance the logic around handling nullable integer data types to ensure compatibility with aggregation operations and casting.

### Bug-Fixed Version:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # Actual managing of mgr_locs should happen via BlockManager.combine
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )
        result = maybe_convert_objects(result)
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate([blk.mgr_locs.to_numpy() for blk in agg_blocks])
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.argsort(indexer))

    for i, blk in enumerate(agg_blocks):
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[i]
    
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- Removed the usage of `maybe_downcast_numeric` and introduced `maybe_convert_objects` to ensure compatibility with nullable integer data types.
- Simplified the aggregation process by directly applying `self.grouper.aggregate` and then converting the result with `maybe_convert_objects`.
- Adjusted the logic for resetting locs in the blocks to maintain proper ordering post-aggregation.

By applying these changes, the bug related to calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype should be resolved.
