### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class, which is a subclass of `GroupBy`.
- The buggy function is responsible for performing aggregation operations in Cython for data blocks.
- The issue reported on GitHub involves calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object that results in a TypeError when the dtype of the DataFrame is 'Int64'.
- The issue occurs due to the handling of nullable integer data type (Int64) in the aggregation process within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of nullable integer data type.
2. Type compatibility issues when calling aggregation functions.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug is caused by the assumption that the data blocks being aggregated do not contain nullable integer data (Int64), leading to a TypeError when processing such data.
- The function does not account for handling nullable integer data when performing aggregation methods such as `mean`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Update the logic in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to correctly handle nullable integer data types when performing aggregation operations like `mean`.
- Ensure proper type compatibility checks and conversions to avoid TypeErrors.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data()

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except (NotImplementedError, TypeError):
            if alt is not None:
                obj = DataFrame(block.values)
                s = get_groupby(obj.squeeze(), self.grouper)
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=1))
            else:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result, try_float=False)
            agg_block: Block = make_block(result)

            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        mask = np.in1d(np.arange(len(data)), deleted)
        indexer -= mask.cumsum()
    
    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset:offset+loc]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

### Changes Made:
1. Updated the handling of nullable integer data using `maybe_convert_objects`.
2. Added checks for handling TypeError exceptions.
3. Simplified the logic and improved type compatibility checks.

By applying these changes, the corrected version of the function should address the issue reported on GitHub.
