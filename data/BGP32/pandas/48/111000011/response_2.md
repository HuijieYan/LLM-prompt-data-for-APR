### Analysis:
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class is responsible for aggregating data, especially in cases where an `Int64` datatype is used, causing a TypeError. The issue on GitHub describes the problem well, mentioning that calling `mean` after grouping results in a TypeError specifically when using the new nullable integer data type `Int64`.

### Bug Identification:
The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function seems to arise from the handling of integer datatypes in the aggregation process. The error specifically occurs when trying to downcast the result in some cases involving `Int64` datatypes.

### Bug Cause:
The key cause of the bug seems to be related to how the function handles data with new nullable integer data type `Int64` during aggregation. The error happens when there are inconsistencies in handling the `Int64` data type during the process, leading to a failure in downcasting the aggregated data.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to handle the `Int64` datatype properly during aggregation. Specifically, the downcasting process has to be reviewed and updated to accommodate the nullable integer data type.

### Bug Fix:

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array

        if block.dtype.kind == 'i' or block.has_object_dtype():

            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )

            # Cast the block back to the original dtype
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result, 'Int64')
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function handles the `Int64` datatype properly during aggregation by considering the integer datatype characteristics and processing accordingly. This fix should address the issue described in the GitHub report.
