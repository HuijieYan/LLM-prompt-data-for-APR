## Analysis:
- The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is a method in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class, which inherits from `GroupBy`.
- The bug reported in the GitHub issue is related to calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` dtype, resulting in a `TypeError`.
- The issue description provides sample code and expected output.
- The problem occurs when calling `mean` after grouping.
- The bug is due to the handling of numeric data in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, affecting how aggregation operations are performed.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. In the loop iterating over blocks, the exception handling for `NotImplementedError` might not be correctly bypassing numeric-only checks.
2. Handling of split object dtype blocks where `_data.blocks` is split into multiple blocks might be causing incorrect aggregation.
3. Downcasting and block creation might introduce inconsistencies in the output blocks.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by improper handling of numeric data during aggregation in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. When encountering `NotImplementedError` or dealing with split items, the function's logic to handle these cases might be incorrect, leading to the `TypeError` reported in the GitHub issue.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the handling of different data types, specifically `Int64` dtype, is correctly managed during aggregation. This involves revisiting the logic for handling exceptions, split items, and downcasting to maintain consistency in the resulting aggregation blocks.

## Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.convert(numeric=True, copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array

        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                raise NotImplementedError("Unsupported operation")  
            else:
                result = alt(block.values, axis=1)

        agg_blocks.append(block.make_block(result))

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate([block.mgr_locs for block in agg_blocks])
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.argsort(indexer))

    for i, block in enumerate(agg_blocks):
        loc = len(block.mgr_locs)
        block.mgr_locs = indexer[sum(len(b.mgr_locs) for b in agg_blocks[:i]):sum(len(b.mgr_locs) for b in agg_blocks[:i+1])]

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version, the handling of numeric data, exceptions, and aggregation logic is improved based on the identified potential error locations. This version should address the reported issue with calling `mean` on `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype.
