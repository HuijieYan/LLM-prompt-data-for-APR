## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is used within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class.
2. The issue on GitHub suggests that calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype results in a `TypeError`.
3. The bug might be related to handling the data type `Int64` during aggregation in the function.
4. The function iterates over blocks in the data, and the bug might be related to how it handles `Int64` type data blocks during aggregation.
5. The bug seems to arise when trying to aggregate data with `Int64` dtype, leading to a `TypeError`.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused due to the handling of `Int64` type data blocks during aggregation. The function fails to handle the `Int64` type data properly, leading to a `TypeError`.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function can handle `Int64` dtype data blocks during aggregation. This may involve specifically handling the `Int64` data type scenario and making necessary data conversions to avoid the `TypeError`.

## Corrected Function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result = no_result
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is not None:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
            else:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    return agg_blocks, data.items
```

Make sure to test this corrected version thoroughly to ensure that it resolves the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report.
