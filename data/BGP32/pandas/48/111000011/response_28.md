### Analysis:
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class is responsible for aggregating data based on the specified parameters. It seems that the bug is related to handling nullable integer data type (`Int64`) during aggregation, which results in a `TypeError`. The `GitHub` issue mentions that calling `mean` after grouping using `Int64` dtype results in a `TypeError`, while it works fine with `int64` dtype.

### Identified Bug:
The bug seems to be related to the processing of nullable integer data type during aggregation in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. The function does not handle `Int64` dtype correctly, which leads to a `TypeError` during subsequent operations like `mean`, `median`, and `std`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the function can handle nullable integer data type (`Int64`) properly during aggregation. We should ensure the correct conversion or manipulation of data to prevent `TypeError` in subsequent operations.

### Bug Fix:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.convert(numeric_only)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    no_result = object()
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=self.axis, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Handling for non-applicable functions
            deleted_items.append(locs)
            continue

        if result is no_result:
            continue
        
        agg_block: Block = make_block(result, placement=locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Adjust the indexing for deleted items
    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        indexer = make_block(data.groups_info.blocks_array, 'grouping').mgr_locs.as_array
        if deleted.size > 0:
            indexer = cast(np.ndarray, make_block(indexer, placement=np.setdiff1d(indexer, deleted)).mgr_locs.as_array)

    return agg_blocks, self.recons_groups(indexer)
```

This corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should handle the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) properly during aggregation, avoiding the `TypeError` issue mentioned in the GitHub problem description.

It's important to test this corrected function thoroughly with both `Int64` and `int64` dtypes to ensure that the issue has been resolved successfully.
