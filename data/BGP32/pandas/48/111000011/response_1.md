### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the `generic.py` file is causing an issue related to calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype, resulting in a TypeError.
- The error seems to be related to handling the nullable integer data type in the groupby operation.
- The issue reported in the GitHub post indicates that mean after grouping results in a TypeError, specifically when using the new nullable integer data type (`Int64`).
- The function is supposed to aggregate data and handle different block types, potentially resulting in errors when dealing with specific data types, like the nullable integer type.

### Identified Error Locations:
- The bug could be related to how the `maybe_downcast_numeric` function is handling the conversion of the result to match the original block dtype.
- Handling of non-numeric types or object-dtype blocks might not be properly managed, leading to type errors when trying to cast back to the original dtype.
- The code might not be properly handling the splitting of object-dtype blocks into separate blocks.
- There might be issues with resetting the locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug seems to be caused by the handling of nullable integer data (`Int64`) types within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. The function may not be properly managing the conversion and aggregation of these specific data types, resulting in a TypeError when trying to perform the mean operation on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Ensure proper handling of nullable integer data types (`Int64`) during the aggregation process.
- Verify the conversion and aggregation logic for different block types, especially when dealing with non-numeric types.
- Adequately manage the splitting of object-dtype blocks to avoid unexpected behavior.
- Verify the correct resetting of locs in the blocks to maintain the current ordering.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            if not block.is_numeric and not block.is_extension:
                raise NotImplementedError("Custom handling needed for non-numeric types")
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                # Exclude the block if no alternate method is available
                assert how == "ohlc"
                continue
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
                result = result._data.blocks[0].values.flatten()
        except TypeError:
            continue
        agg_block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset locs in the blocks
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[:loc]
        indexer = indexer[loc:]

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function aims to handle nullable integer data types (`Int64`) properly during the aggregation process, addressing potential issues related to error handling and block management.
