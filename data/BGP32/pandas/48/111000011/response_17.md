### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in pandas.
2. The function aggregates blocks based on certain conditions, but the issue reported on GitHub shows that calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype results in a `TypeError`.
3. The bug seems to be related to handling of nullable integer data type (`Int64`) during aggregation.
4. The GitHub issue provides examples where the error occurs and the expected output.
5. The bug causes a `TypeError` when aggregating `Int64` data, especially with functions like `mean`, `median`, and `std`.

### Error Location:
- The error occurs due to improper handling of data blocks with `Int64` dtype during aggregation.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by a mismatch or incompatibility in handling nullable integer data type (`Int64`) during aggregation. The current code doesn't properly handle this type of data and leads to a `TypeError` in certain aggregation functions.

### Strategy for Fixing:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles nullable integer data type (`Int64`) during aggregation. This might involve checking the data type of each block being aggregated and applying the appropriate conversions or operations to avoid the `TypeError`.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result = no_result

        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            result = no_result

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result)

            if result.ndim == 1:
                result = result.reshape(1, -1)

            agg_block: Block = make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.argsort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : offset + loc]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, I have added a check to convert the result to compatible types (`maybe_convert_objects`) and included reshaping for cases where the result has only 1 dimension. This should help in handling nullable integer data type (`Int64`) correctly during aggregation.
