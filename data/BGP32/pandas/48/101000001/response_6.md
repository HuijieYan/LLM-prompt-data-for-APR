The bug in the provided function `_cython_agg_blocks` seems to be related to the handling of split object-dtype blocks. The function is intended to aggregate blocks of data, but it encounters issues when dealing with split blocks, which leads to incorrect results or exceptions.

Here are the steps to fix the bug:

1. The function `DataFrameGroupBy._cython_agg_blocks` should iterate over block items and perform aggregation individually. It seems the current implementation is trying to process aggregates at a block level, leading to issues with split blocks.

2. In cases where a block is split into two blocks (T, U), the logic should handle this splitting correctly without assuming a single block input and output.

3. The handling of split blocks is causing inconsistencies in the aggregation process. The function needs to properly handle split items and frames to ensure correct aggregation results.

4. Update the logic within the loop that aggregates block data to handle split blocks properly. Ensure that the aggregation output from split blocks is correctly processed before appending to the final aggregated result.

Here is a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is not None:
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                    obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                try:
                    result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                except TypeError:
                    pass
                else:
                    result = cast(DataFrame, result)
                    result = result.iloc[:, [0]]._data.blocks[0].values

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result, try_float=False, convert_integer=True)
            agg_block: Block = make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.argsort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version attempts to properly handle the splitting of object-dtype blocks and aggregate them accordingly. Make sure to test this corrected version to verify that it fixes the bug in the original function.
