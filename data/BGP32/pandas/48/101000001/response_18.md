I have analyzed the provided buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` along with its context and related functions. Based on the code and related functions, I can identify a potential error location which might lead to a bug in the code.

Potential Error Location:
- The potential error might occur in the block where `agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)` is executed. There is no check for the case where `result` may be `None`, which could result in `agg_block` being `None`. This could potentially lead to issues downstream in the code.
- Additionally, the `if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):` condition to check if either `agg_blocks` or `split_frames` is empty before raising `DataError` could potentially fail to trigger an error in certain edge cases where none of the aggregates or splits are performed.

Explanation of the Bug:
- The primary cause of the bug is the potential issue with generating `agg_block` with a potential `None` value due to the lack of appropriate handling for such cases. This could eventually lead to unexpected behavior when manipulating the `agg_blocks` list.
- The bug might not be immediately evident without inspecting the specific scenarios where `result` may not be computed correctly due to exceptions or special cases.

Strategy to Fix the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we should implement proper error handling where `result` might be `None`, ensuring that `agg_block` is not instantiated with a `None` value.
- We should also revisit the condition checking for `agg_blocks` and `split_frames` to accurately determine when to raise a `DataError` based on the presence of valid aggregates or splits.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python

        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":

        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

        for block in data.blocks:

                )

                else:
                    result = cast(DataFrame, result)

                        split_frames.append(result)
                        continue

            if result is not no_result and result is not None:
                result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
    
                if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                    assert result.ndim == 1 or result.shape[0] == 1
                    try:
                        result = type(block.values)._from_sequence(
                            result.ravel(), dtype=block.values.dtype
                        )
                    except ValueError:

        for blk in agg_blocks:

``` 

This corrected version includes adequate checks to ensure the proper handling of potential `None` values and errors in the aggregation process, as well as a revised condition for raising `DataError` based on the presence of valid aggregates.
