The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function arises from improper handling of data blocks during the aggregation process. The main issue is related to splitting object-dtype blocks into separate blocks, causing incorrect aggregation results and indexing errors later in the function.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling split object blocks and ensure correct aggregation for all data types. Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            result = alt(block.values, axis=1)
        assert result is not None
        
        if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
            result = result.reshape(1, -1)
        
        result = maybe_convert_objects(result)
        result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
        
        if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
            result = block.make_block(result)
            agg_blocks.append(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
    
    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
    
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))
    
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version, we have simplified the logic for aggregation, ensured proper handling of the result data types, and avoided splitting object blocks unnecessarily. This should address the bugs and provide correct aggregation results for different data types.
