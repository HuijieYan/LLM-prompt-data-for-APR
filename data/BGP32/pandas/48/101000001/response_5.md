The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function lies in the handling of the variable `agg_block`. In the case where `result` is not equal to `no_result`, the function logic creates the `agg_block` variable, but it does not handle the case where `result` is equal to `no_result` properly. This would lead to an uninitialized `agg_block` being appended to `agg_blocks`, causing an issue when returning `agg_blocks`.

To fix this bug:

1. Initialize the `agg_block` variable outside the loop and update it only when the `result` is not equal to `no_result`.
2. Add a condition to check if `agg_block` is not `None` before appending it to `agg_blocks`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    agg_block = None  # Initialize agg_block here
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        except NotImplementedError as e:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            # Rest of the code remains the same

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            agg_block = block.make_block(result)  # Update agg_block value here

            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Rest of the code remains the same
```

By following this correction strategy, we ensure that the `agg_block` is properly initialized and appended to `agg_blocks` only when needed, fixing the bug in the function.
