To fix the bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, it is important to identify the root cause of the issue. The bug seems to arise from the manipulation of the `agg_blocks` list and the associated `mgr_locs`. The bug results in incorrect indexing and alignment of blocks in the final output. 

### Bug Explanation:
1. The main issue is related to the handling of split items and frames. When there are split items (object-dtype blocks split into List[Block[T], Block[U]]), the code is not correctly handling the indexing and alignment of these split items in the output `agg_blocks`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the indexing and alignment of split items are correctly managed with respect to `mgr_locs` to avoid incorrect grouping and aggregation.
2. Properly adjust the indexer and `mgr_locs` to align the newly aggregated blocks in the final output.

### Corrected Version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is not None:
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                try:
                    result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                except TypeError:
                    # Exclude the block if aggregation fails
                    continue
                else:
                    result = maybe_convert_objects(result)
                    result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, original_dtype=block.dtype)
                    agg_block = make_block(result, locs)

        else:
            if result is None:
                continue
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result)
            result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, original_dtype=block.dtype)
            agg_block = make_block(result, locs)

        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
        new_items.append(locs)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

### Additional Changes:
1. Removed unnecessary lists for deleted items and split items.
2. Simplified the handling of aggregation results and block creation.
3. Fixed indexing and alignment for aggregated blocks in the final output.

By making the above corrections, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should now handle the aggregation process correctly without any indexing or alignment issues.
