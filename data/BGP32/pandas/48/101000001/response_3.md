The cause of the bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is related to how the new_items are being appended to the `agg_blocks`. There are inconsistencies in appending the `agg_block` to `agg_blocks` and appending the `locs` to `new_items`.

The fix for this bug is to ensure that `agg_block` is only appended to `agg_blocks` when it has been correctly created, and to append the corresponding `locs` to `new_items` inside the `if` block where the `agg_block` is created.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Exception handling

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                try:
                    result = type(block.values)._from_sequence(
                        result.ravel(), dtype=block.values.dtype
                    )
                except ValueError:
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)
            
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    if split_items:
        # Clean up the mess left over from split blocks.
        for locs, result in zip(split_items, split_frames):
            for i, loc in enumerate(locs):
                new_items.append(np.array([loc], dtype=locs.dtype))
                agg_blocks.append(result.iloc[:, [i]]._data.block)

    # Rest of the code remains the same

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, the `agg_block` is appended to `agg_blocks` only when it has been successfully created inside the `if result is not no_result` block. The corresponding `locs` are appended to `new_items` within the same block to ensure consistency between the two lists.
