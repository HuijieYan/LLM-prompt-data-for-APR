Upon analyzing the buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks`, we can identify potential error locations. One possible cause of the bug is the incorrect indexing and handling of `agg_blocks` and `split_frames` during block aggregation. The function is intended to aggregate blocks based on specific criteria, but there are inconsistencies in the handling of various cases, particularly when dealing with split object-dtype blocks.

To fix the bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, we need to ensure proper indexing and alignment of the aggregated blocks and split frames. Additionally, we should address the handling of exceptions and ensure that the code progresses smoothly even in cases of failure during aggregation.

Here is a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                # Exclude the block if alternative aggregation is not possible
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            result = s.transform(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))

        if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            result = result._data.blocks[0].values

        agg_block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No valid data to aggregate")

    return agg_blocks, data.items
```

In this corrected version, we have removed unnecessary handling of deleted items and split frames. Instead, we focus on aggregating the blocks based on the specified criteria and storing them in the `agg_blocks` list. The function now properly handles exceptions and ensures a smooth progression through the aggregation process.

By simplifying the logic and ensuring consistent handling of aggregated blocks, the corrected version of `_cython_agg_blocks` should now function correctly without the previous bug.
