## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` within the class `DataFrameGroupBy` in the `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` file is responsible for aggregating data blocks.
2. The function iterates over blocks within the `data` BlockManager, performs aggregation based on specified conditions, and creates new aggregation blocks.
3. The bug could potentially arise from misinterpretation of block aggregation results, handling of alternative aggregation methods, cleaning up split block mess, or resetting block locs.
4. The bug seems to be related to handling split blocks where assumptions about single block inputs and outputs are violated, potentially leading to incorrect aggregation and block creation.
  
## Bug Description:
The bug occurs when dealing with split object-dtype blocks resulting from certain conditions during aggregation. The code assumes a single block input returning a single block output, but in the case of split blocks, this assumption fails, leading to mishandling of block data and potentially incorrect aggregation results.
  
## Fix Strategy:
1. Introduce proper handling for split object-dtype blocks in the aggregation process.
2. Adjust the logic to correctly address split block scenarios and process the data accordingly.
3. Ensure consistent handling of block input-output relationships to avoid errors during aggregation.
