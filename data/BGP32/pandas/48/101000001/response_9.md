The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function stems from the way blocks are being processed and the possibility of object blocks being split into two separate blocks. The logic for handling these split blocks is flawed and requires correction.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The loop that iterates over `data.blocks` processes each block and may end up splitting object-dtype blocks into two separate lists: `split_items` and `split_frames`. 
2. However, when processing the split blocks, the blocks themselves and their respective locations (`locs`) are not handled correctly when adding them to the `agg_blocks` list.
3. The current logic for handling the split blocks does not accurately link the original block locations to the split frames, causing confusion in reordering and managing the split frames.

### Fix Strategy:
1. When splitting object-dtype blocks, appropriately manage the association between the original `locs` and the split frames.
2. Update the logic for iterating and processing the split blocks to ensure the correct linking of locations and split frames in the `agg_blocks` list.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            result = cast(DataFrame, result)

            if len(result._data.blocks) != 1:
                split_items.append(locs)
                split_frames.append(result)
                continue

            result = result._data.blocks[0].values
            if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
                result = result.reshape(1, -1)

        assert not isinstance(result, DataFrame)

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
            new_items.append(locs)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    for split_locs, split_frame in zip(split_items, split_frames):
        for i, loc in enumerate(split_locs):
            new_items.append(np.array([loc], dtype=locs.dtype))
            agg_block = split_frame.iloc[:, [i]]._data.blocks[0]
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version, the handling of split blocks in the `for` loop and the subsequent processing of these split blocks has been updated to ensure the correct association of locations and split frames in the `agg_blocks` list. This should address the bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function and improve its functionality.
