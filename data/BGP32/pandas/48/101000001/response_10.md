The bug in the provided function `_cython_agg_blocks` is related to the incomplete handling of data blocks during the aggregation process. The issue arises when attempting to combine split object-dtype blocks into a single consistent output, potentially leading to incorrect results or exceptions.

To fix this bug, a strategy would involve ensuring that the handling of split object blocks is properly managed, including the concatenation of new items and adjustment of locs. Additionally, proper exception handling for cases where the aggregation method is not applicable is essential to maintain the integrity of the aggregation process.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function with the bug fixed:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            else:
                result = cast(DataFrame, result)
                if len(result._data.blocks) != 1:
                    split_items.append(locs)
                    split_frames.append(result)
                    continue

                result = result._data.blocks[0].values
                if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)

        if not isinstance(result, DataFrame) and result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    if split_items:
        for locs, result in zip(split_items, split_frames):
            assert len(locs) == result.shape[1]
            for i, loc in enumerate(locs):
                new_items.append(np.array([loc], dtype=locs.dtype))
                agg_blocks.append(result.iloc[:, [i]]._data.blocks[0])

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, the processing of split object-dtype blocks is appropriately managed to ensure that the aggregation results are consistent and accurate. Additionally, proper exception handling is incorporated to handle cases where the aggregation method may not be applicable.

By fixing these issues, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should now perform the aggregation of data blocks correctly without encountering the previously identified bug.
