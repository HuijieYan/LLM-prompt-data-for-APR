### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the file `generic.py`. The function aims to perform aggregation operations on data blocks based on specified criteria. The error arises when trying to cast float values to integer values, which is not feasible due to the nature of the data.

The issue stems from the incorrect handling of numeric data. If the data is numeric-only, non-numeric data should be excluded or handled differently. The function `_cython_agg_blocks` fails to account for cases where non-numeric data exists within the blocks. This leads to an attempt to cast float data to integer data, which is not correct.

### Bug Location
The bug is located in the portion of the function where an attempt is made to cast data values to specific types. The bug specifically arises in handling non-numeric data within the blocks during the aggregation process.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by a lack of appropriate handling for non-numeric data in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. When the function encounters non-numeric data, instead of excluding it, it tries to cast float values (from aggregation results) to integer values, resulting in a type error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to enhance the logic for handling non-numeric data within the blocks. If the function encounters non-numeric data while aggregating, it should handle the data separately or exclude it from the aggregation, rather than trying to cast float values to integers.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        # Handle non-numeric data
        if not np.issubdtype(block.values.dtype, np.number):
            deleted_items.append(locs)
            continue

        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        if result is not None:  # Check for valid results
            # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
    
    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
    
    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))
    
    if deleted_items:
        # Adjust the indexer to account for the items we have removed
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]
    
    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc
    
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By including proper handling for blocks containing non-numeric data, the corrected version of the function should now avoid the type error during aggregation processes.
