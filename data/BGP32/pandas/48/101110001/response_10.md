### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is causing a type error when attempting to cast `float64` arrays to `int64` arrays using `values.astype(dtype, casting="safe", copy=copy)`. This error is being triggered when the function tries to convert floating-point values to integers. The issue lies in handling the dtype conversion in a safe manner when aggregating data.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function when attempting to cast array values from `float64` to `int64`.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is due to an improper type conversion of `float64` to `int64` in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. The conversion is not safe for these different data types, leading to a type error.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to handle the conversion from `float64` to `int64` properly, ensuring that the type casting is done in a manner that avoids the TypeError. One common approach is to convert floating-point numbers to integers using `values.astype(int)` instead of attempting to cast directly from `float64` to `int64`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        except NotImplementedError:
            result = np.vectorize(lambda x: alt(x) if alt is not None else x)(block.values)
        
        agg_block = block.make_block(result.astype(int))
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
        new_items.append(locs)
    
    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
    
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))
    
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version safely casts the aggregated data from `float64` to `int64`.
