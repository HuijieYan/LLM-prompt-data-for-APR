### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function when trying to cast non-equivalent float values to int values. This TypeError arises from an attempt to safely cast the datatype while it's not feasible due to the difference between float64 and int64.

The error happens due to the internal type casting of values during the aggregation process which eventually causes type mismatch issues and fails the comparison of equivalent values.

### Bug Location:
The bug is isolated in the `_cython_agg_blocks` method within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class of the pandas library.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by an improper datatype conversion during the aggregation process. When trying to cast values from float64 to int64, it fails due to the type mismatch, leading to the `TypeError`.

### Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug, we should ensure that the datatype casting between float and int values follows a proper approach, considering the specific requirements of the aggregation calculations.

### Updated Corrected Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function with modifications to handle datatype conversions correctly:
```python
    def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
        
        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        
        for block in data.blocks:
            result = None
            locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
            
            try:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
            except NotImplementedError:
                if alt is not None:
                    obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                    s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                    
                    result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                    result = cast(DataFrame, result)
                    
                    if len(result) == 1:
                        result, = result._data.blocks
                        if result.values.ndim == 1:
                            result = pd.Series(result.values)
                        
                if result is not None:
                    result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
                    agg_block = block.make_block(result)
                    new_items.append(locs)
                    agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
    
        if not (agg_blocks):
            raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
        
        indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
        agg_items = data.items.take(np.argsort(indexer))
        
        for i, blk in enumerate(agg_blocks):
            loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
            blk.mgr_locs = indexer[i: i + loc]
    
        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By following these fixes, the corrected function should now accurately perform the datatype conversions during aggregation and avoid the `TypeError` related to the non-equivalent type casting error.
