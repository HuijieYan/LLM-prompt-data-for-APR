## Analysis
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the `generic.py` file of the pandas library is causing a TypeError when trying to cast a float64 value to int64. The error occurs in the safe_cast method while attempting to cast the values. This issue arises during aggregation functions such as mean, median, and var.

The error can be traced back to attempting to cast float64 values to int64 within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. The intention here is to handle various data types, but the incorrect casting is causing the TypeError.

## Bug Cause
The bug arises from the incorrect casting of float64 to int64 when aggregating in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. The bug causes a cast error that throws a TypeError due to the difference in data types being cast.

## Fix Strategy
To resolve the bug, the safe casting of the data needs to account for different data types properly. The handling should consider the variance in input data types during aggregation, avoiding the casting issue when trying to cast from float64 to int64.

## Solution
Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to address the bug:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )[0]
        result = maybe_convert_objects(result)
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
    
    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
    
    return agg_blocks, data.items
```

In this corrected version, the `result` is obtained by directly aggregating the values, converting objects when necessary before creating block instances for aggregation blocks. This approach ensures that the resulting data is correctly handled during aggregation, avoiding data type conflicts.
