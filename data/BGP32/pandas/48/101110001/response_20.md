### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs when trying to apply functions like `mean`, `median`, or `var` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with nullable integer values. The underlying issue is casting from `float64` to `int64`, which results in an error due to the incompatible data types.

The issue arises in the `_cython_agg_blocks` method within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. The logic for handling numeric aggregation does not properly cater to nullable integer values, leading to the failed conversions and subsequent `TypeError`.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the logic inside the `_cython_agg_blocks` method to handle nullable integer values appropriately when performing aggregation.
2. Ensure that there are checks to handle cases where numeric data types need to be properly converted without loss of data integrity.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the updated version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function with necessary fixes to handle nullable integers:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
   
    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
   
    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        if block.is_extension:
            # Handle nullable integer blocks separately
            result = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
        else:
            try:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
            except NotImplementedError:
                # Handle non-applicable functions differently
                pass
            else:
                agg_block = block.make_block(result)

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Updating agg_blocks and returning results
    return agg_blocks, data.items.take(np.concatenate(new_items))
```

This version of the function should properly handle the aggregation and casting logic for nullable integers, fixing the casting error that arises in the failing tests.
