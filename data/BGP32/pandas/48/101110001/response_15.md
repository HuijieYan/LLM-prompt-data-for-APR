### Analysis:
1. The function `_cython_agg_blocks` is responsible for the aggregation process within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class.
2. The error message points to a TypeError caused by trying to cast array values from `float64` to `int64` with the `casting='safe'` rule, indicating an issue with data type conversion.
3. The error occurs during the aggregation function execution.
4. The issue arises from not handling floating-point values correctly during aggregation operations that are expected to return integer values.
5. The buggy function doesn't appropriately handle conversion and casting in cases where non-equivalent data types are present.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, enhance the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle cases where the data types are not equivalent, especially when casting from floats to integers during aggregation.

### Updated Function Code:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function with modifications to handle data type conversions more robustly:
```python
    def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
        no_result = object()
        for block in data.blocks:
            result = no_result
            locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
            try:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
            except NotImplementedError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
    
            if result is no_result:
                continue

            # Correct type handling to safely cast
            safe_conversion = lambda x: int(x) if how != 'var' else float(x)
    
            result, handled = safe_conversion(result)
            if not handled:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
    
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
    
        if not agg_blocks:
            raise DataError("No matching data types for aggregation")
    
        # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our
        # current ordering
        indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
        agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))
    
        if deleted_items:
            deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
            ai = np.arange(len(data))
            mask = np.zeros(len(data))
            mask[deleted] = 1
            indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]
    
        offset = 0
        for blk in agg_blocks:
            loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
            blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
            offset += loc
    
        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By modifying the conversion logic to safely handle data types during aggregation, this corrected function should now address the TypeError related to casting from float64 to int64 and pass the failing test cases.
