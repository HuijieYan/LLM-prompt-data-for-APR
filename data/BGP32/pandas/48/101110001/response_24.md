### Issue Analysis
The error occurs due to an improper casting of float values to integer values while performing aggregation ("mean", "median", "var") within the groupby operation. The error message indicates that there is an attempt to cast `float64` to `int64`, causing a type conversion error.

### Bug Location
The bug arises in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py`. Specifically, the block values returned from aggregation processes are forced into integer type without considering the original data type of the values, resulting in the type conversion error.

### Bug Explanation
The reason for the bug is that in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, there is an assumption that the aggregated values should be converted to integer type, leading to the casting error between float and integer types on some operations ("mean", "median", "var").

### Bug Fix Strategy
The bug can be fixed by handling the type conversion properly during the aggregation process. The type casting should be based on the output type that matches the result of the aggregation method. Moreover, it is crucial to have a more robust check to avoid conflicts between float and integer types. 

### Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
   
	data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

	if numeric_only:
	    data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

	agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
	new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
	deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
	split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
	split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

	no_result = object()
	for block in data.blocks:
	    result = block.mgr_locs.as_array.copy()
	    try:
	        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
	            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
	        )
	        result_single = result[1] if isinstance(result, tuple) else result
	        
	        # Adjust dtype after aggregation based on the output type
	        result_single = maybe_convert_objects(result_single, block.dtype)
	        
	        agg_block: Block = make_block(result_single, block.items, axis=0)
	        
	    except (NotImplementedError, TypeError):
	    	# Handle the exceptions for specific operations
	        if alt is None:
	            deleted_items.append(result)
	        else: 
	            deleted_items.append(result)
	    else:
	        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

	if not agg_blocks:
	    raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

	indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
	agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

	# No need for adjustments for deleted items

	return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This modification ensures that the handling of the values during aggregation is done correctly based on the output type, avoiding the casting error between float and integer types.
