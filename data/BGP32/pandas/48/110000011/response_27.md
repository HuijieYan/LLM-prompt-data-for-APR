## Analysis:
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class is responsible for calculating aggregated values for numeric blocks within a group. The issue reported on GitHub describes a problem when calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` dtype columns, resulting in a `TypeError`.

## Potential error locations:
1. The block's dtype handling and aggregation process might be causing the `TypeError` issue.
2. The logic for alternative aggregation method (`alt`) when `how` is `'ohlc'` seems to be incorrect.
3. Handling of cases where result is a DataFrame and casting back to the original dtype.
4. Ensuring proper conversion from `Int64` to numerical types for aggregation.

## Bug cause:
The bug seems to be caused by the handling of the `Int64` dtype during the aggregation process within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. The handling of alternative aggregation methods when encountering the `'ohlc'` case may also be incorrect, leading to the `TypeError`.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure proper handling of the `Int64` dtype during aggregation.
2. Check the logic for the alternative aggregation method (`alt`) when `how` is `'ohlc'`.
3. Improve handling of converting DataFrame results back to the original dtype.

## Corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    agg_block: Block

    no_result = object()
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Handle alt method for 'ohlc'
            if alt is not None and how == 'ohlc':
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                result = obj.apply(alt, axis=1).values
            else:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
        
        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Handle sorting and adjustment of indexer
    indexer = np.concatenate([block.mgr_locs for block in agg_blocks])
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]
    
    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

## Summary:
The corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should properly handle the aggregation of numeric types, including the `Int64` dtype columns when calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object. Additionally, the logic for alternative aggregation methods (`alt`) when encountering the `'ohlc'` case has been improved.
