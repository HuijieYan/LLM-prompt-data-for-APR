### Analysis:
The bug is related to calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy object with `Int64` dtype, which results in a `TypeError`. The issue seems to occur when specific aggregation functions like `mean`, `median`, and `std` are used. The bug lies within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` file.

### Error Location:
The bug occurs when attempting to aggregate data with nullable integer type columns (`Int64`). The issue arises during the process of applying aggregation functions to the grouped data using Cython optimizations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises because the function `_cython_agg_blocks` does not handle the nullable integer dtype (`Int64`) columns properly during aggregation operations like `mean` or `median`. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to perform these operations on the grouped data.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the nullable integer dtype (`Int64`) columns properly in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. Specifically, we need to ensure that the aggregation operations like `mean` are compatible with nullable integer dtype.

### Bug-fixed Version:
I will propose a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle nullable integer dtype (`Int64`) columns properly during aggregation operations like `mean`.

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        if result is None:
            continue
        
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset:offset + loc]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function simplifies the aggregation process and properly handles nullable integer dtype (`Int64`) columns during aggregation operations. This should address the `TypeError` issue when calling `mean` on a DataFrameGroupBy with `Int64` dtype.
