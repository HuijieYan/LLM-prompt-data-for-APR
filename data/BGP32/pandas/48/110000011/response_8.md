### Analysis:
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is used in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class to aggregate data based on specified criteria. The issue reported on GitHub is related to calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy object with `Int64` dtype data, which results in a `TypeError`. This bug occurs when an alternate method of aggregation needs to be used due to certain conditions.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of alternate aggregation method when `NotImplementedError` is raised.
2. Type checking and handling for the result of aggregation.
3. Downcasting the data back to its original dtype after aggregation.
4. Managing split object-dtype blocks in case of DataFrame splits.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when an alternate aggregation method is triggered due to conditions like `NotImplementedError`. The function expects a specific outcome from the aggregation process based on the dtype, but in certain cases, it encounters situations that require handling in a different way. This results in an error when casting the data back to its original dtype.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check the conditions under which the alternate aggregation method is triggered.
2. Ensure proper type checking and handling for the result of aggregation.
3. Confirm the data is downcasted back to its original dtype correctly.
4. Manage the split object-dtype blocks appropriately.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    no_result = object()

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array

        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Condition for alternate aggregation
            result = alt(block, axis=self.axis) if alt else no_result

        if result is not no_result and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            if block.is_extension:
                try:
                    result = type(block.values)._from_sequence(
                        result.ravel(), dtype=block.dtype
                    )
                except ValueError:
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Prepare the final aggregated blocks and items
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    # Adjust the indexer if items were removed during aggregation
    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version addresses the conditions for alternate aggregation, ensures proper downcasting of data, and manages the aggregated blocks appropriately in cases where an alternate method needs to be applied.
