### Analysis:
The issue reported on GitHub states that calling the `mean()` function on a DataFrameGroupBy object with `Int64` dtype columns results in a TypeError. The error occurs when using the nullable integer data type. This bug is likely happening due to an issue in the `_cython_agg_blocks()` function in the `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` file.

### Bug Location:
The bug likely occurs in the `_cython_agg_blocks()` function where DataFrame objects with `Int64` dtype columns are not handled correctly during the aggregation process.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `_cython_agg_blocks()` function is not handling the nullable integer dtype (`Int64`) columns properly when iterating over the blocks to aggregate the data. This leads to a TypeError when calling certain aggregation functions like `mean()`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_cython_agg_blocks()` function properly handles `Int64` dtype columns during the aggregation process. We can identify the columns with `Int64` dtype and apply appropriate handling to prevent the TypeError.

### Bug-fixed Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks()` function that addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []
    
    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None or (
                block.dtype == 'Int64' and how in ['mean', 'median', 'std']
            ):
                # If alt is not defined or block is of Int64 dtype and function is mean, median, std
                # exclude the block and continue aggregation
                assert how in ['min', 'max', 'first', 'last']  # Prevent error for unsupported functions
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

        # Rest of the function remains the same as the original version

    # Rest of the function remains the same as the original version

    return agg_blocks, agg_items  # Return aggregated blocks and items
```

This corrected version checks for the `Int64` dtype columns and ensures that they are excluded from performing aggregation functions like `mean`, `median`, and `std`. This fix should prevent the TypeError from occurring when calling `mean()` on a DataFrameGroupBy object with `Int64` columns.
