## Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with the GitHub issue
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is a method of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class, which is responsible for aggregating data based on the specified method (e.g., mean, sum, etc.). The GitHub issue describes a problem that occurs when calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with columns of `Int64` data type. This aligns with the functionality of the `_cython_agg_blocks` method, which involves aggregation operations on blocks of data.

## Identify potential error locations within the buggy function
1. Handling of numeric data only may result in type inconsistencies.
2. An error might occur in the aggregation process if the data type is not supported.
3. Checking for unsupported operations may lead to incorrect exclusions.
4. Reassigning `result` to a DataFrame after aggregation might cause issues.
5. Cleaning up split blocks may not be done correctly.

## Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function
The bug seems to stem from the way the `_cython_agg_blocks` method handles aggregation of data blocks within a groupby operation. The issue reported on GitHub is related to calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with columns of `Int64` data type, which might be associated with incorrect type handling or aggregation process within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

## Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the aggregation logic within the `_cython_agg_blocks` method should be reviewed and modified to properly handle the `Int64` data type. Specifically, attention should be given to the aggregation operation when non-numeric types are encountered, as well as the handling of result types. Ensuring that the aggregation process can correctly handle the nullable integer data type should address the issue reported on GitHub.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
    def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

        no_result = object()
        for block in data.blocks:
            result = no_result
            locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
            try:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
            except (NotImplementedError, TypeError):
                if alt is None:
                    deleted_items.append(locs)
                    continue

                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                    obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))

            if not isinstance(result, DataFrame):
                result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, dtype=block.dtype)
                agg_block = block.make_block(result)
                new_items.append(block.mgr_locs)
                agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

        if not agg_blocks:
            raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

        return agg_blocks, data.items
```

In the corrected version:
1. Exception handling has been improved to catch both `NotImplementedError` and `TypeError` during aggregation.
2. The downcasting process has been updated to handle different data types appropriately.
3. The logic for adding aggregated blocks has been revised to correctly append processed data.
4. The function now returns the aggregated blocks and items directly without further processing.

This corrected version should address the issue reported on GitHub when calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` data type columns.
