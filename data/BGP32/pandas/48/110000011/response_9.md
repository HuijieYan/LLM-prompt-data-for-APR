### Analysis:
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the `pandas.core.groupby.generic` module. The issue reported on GitHub is related to calling `mean` on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype results in a TypeError. The error occurs when using the new nullable integer data type.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of nullable integer data type in the aggregation process.
2. Data type conversion and casting operations.
3. Error handling and exception catching mechanisms.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by the handling of nullable integer data type in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. When applying aggregation functions like `mean` on columns with nullable integer data type (`Int64`), there might be an issue with the data type conversion or casting process, leading to a TypeError. The bug may also relate to how the function handles special cases like splitting object-dtype blocks.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) correctly during the aggregation process. This may involve ensuring proper data type conversion, handling special cases related to split blocks, and enhancing error handling for consistent behavior across different data types.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(block, how, axis=self.axis, min_count=min_count)
        if result is not None:
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result)
            agg_block: Block = make_block(result)
            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    agg_items = np.concatenate(new_items)
    return agg_blocks, data.items.take(agg_items)
```

Ensure to test this corrected version to verify if the reported issue with `mean` on nullable integer data type is resolved. The fix focuses on handling data type conversion correctly and simplifying the aggregation process.
