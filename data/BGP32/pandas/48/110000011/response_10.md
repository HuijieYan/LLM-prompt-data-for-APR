## Analysis:
The bug is related to calling the `mean` method on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` dtype columns, resulting in a `TypeError`. This issue arises when trying to aggregate data using the `mean` method on nullable integer columns.

## Error Location:
The bug is likely originating from the `_cython_agg_blocks` function within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class, where the aggregation process for numeric types is being handled.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the implementation of the `_cython_agg_blocks` method does not properly handle nullable integer columns when trying to aggregate data with the `mean` method. This leads to a `TypeError` being raised due to improper handling of the `Int64` dtype columns.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the aggregation process for nullable integer columns needs to be adjusted within the `_cython_agg_blocks` method. Proper handling of nullable integer dtype columns during the aggregation process should resolve the issue.

## Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` method that addresses the issue:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    if alt is None:
        # Perform the operation in the same way as before
        dtype_to_reduce = data.dtypes.unique()
        if len(dtype_to_reduce) != 1 or not np.issubdtype(dtype_to_reduce[0], np.number):
            raise TypeError("Data must be of numeric type")
    
        # Aggregate the data using the specified method
        agg_blocks = data._reduce(how, axis=0, skipna=True, numeric_only=True, min_count=min_count)
    else:
        agg_blocks = data._cython_agg_blocks(how, alt=alt, min_count=min_count)

    # If no aggregation blocks are present, raise an error
    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.arange(len(data))
    
    new_items = [block.mgr_locs.as_array for block in data.blocks]

    # Update the locations in the blocks after aggregation
    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : offset + loc]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, data.items
```

By updating the aggregation process and ensuring proper handling of nullable integer columns during the aggregation, this corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` method should resolve the TypeError issue when calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` dtype columns.
