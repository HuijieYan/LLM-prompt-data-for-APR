### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the `pandas.core.groupby.generic` module.
2. The function is responsible for aggregating blocks of data based on specified criteria.
3. The related functions `aggregate` and `_get_data_to_aggregate` are called within `_cython_agg_blocks`.
4. The failing test is related to calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` dtype, leading to a TypeError.
5. The GitHub issue describes a similar problem where calling `mean` after grouping results in a TypeError.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely due to a TypeError occurring when trying to perform aggregation operations on nullable integer values in the `DataFrameGroupBy` object.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the aggregation of nullable integer values correctly within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. This involves adjusting the data processing logic to handle nullable integers and avoid the TypeError.

### Corrected Version:
Here is a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        if block.dtype.name == "Int64" and block.is_extension:
            # Handle nullable integer blocks
            result = block._try_aggregate(how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        else:
            locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

        if result is not None:
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result)
            agg_block: Block = make_block(result)

            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version includes handling nullable integer blocks correctly during aggregation, which should resolve the TypeError issue when calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` dtype.
