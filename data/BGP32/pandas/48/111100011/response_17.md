### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class which inherits from `GroupBy`.
2. The function is responsible for aggregating data based on specified criteria but is currently failing when calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` dtype.
3. The bug seems to be related to the handling of nullable integer data type during aggregation.
4. The error in the function is likely causing the failure observed in the test code provided.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is likely caused by the handling of `Int64` dtype during aggregation, specifically when the `mean` function is called.
- The function `_cython_agg_blocks` may not be correctly handling the `Int64` dtype in this case, leading to a TypeError.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- We need to ensure that the function correctly handles the nullable integer data type `Int64` during aggregation.
- Specifically, when calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` dtype, the function should handle this case appropriately.

### Correction:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)[0]

        result = maybe_convert_objects(result)  # convert to object dtype if needed

        agg_block: Block = make_block(result, placement=block.mgr_locs)

        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    return agg_blocks, data.items
```

By modifying the function to correctly convert the aggregated result to an object dtype using `maybe_convert_objects` and making sure the placement matches the original block's location, we can fix the bug related to handling `Int64` dtype during aggregation.
