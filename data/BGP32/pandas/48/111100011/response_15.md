### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` file.
- The function is related to data aggregation operations within a grouped DataFrame.
- The function is failing in scenarios when calling `mean` or other aggregation functions on grouped DataFrame with nullable integer data type (Int64).
- The root cause of the issue seems to be the handling of nullable integer data type within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, leading to a `TypeError`.
- The GitHub issue provides a clear description of the problem and the expected output, highlighting the issue with calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype.

### Error Location:
- The error seems to be related to the handling of nullable integer data within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, especially when performing aggregation operations like `mean`.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug arises due to the incorrect handling of nullable integer data type (Int64) within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.
- The function fails to appropriately process the nullable integer data, leading to a `TypeError` when calling aggregation functions like `mean`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- The fix should involve ensuring that the function correctly handles nullable integer data type when performing aggregation operations.
- Check for the presence of nullable integer data and implement appropriate handling to prevent the `TypeError` during aggregation.
- Make necessary adjustments to accommodate nullable integer data within the aggregation logic.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        if isinstance(result, pd.Series):
            result = result.astype('float64').values  # Convert to float if needed

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    for i, blk in enumerate(agg_blocks):
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[:loc]
        indexer = indexer[loc:]

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

### Conclusion:
The corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should now appropriately handle nullable integer data types during aggregation, ensuring compatibility with the grouped DataFrame operations. This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and enable smooth aggregation of nullable integer data in grouped DataFrames.
