### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` file.
2. The function is attempting to aggregate data using Cython-based operations within a GroupBy object.
3. The issue mentioned in the GitHub problem relates to calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype, resulting in a TypeError.
4. The bug seems to be related to handling nullable integer data types in the aggregation process.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function occurs because the logic for handling nullable integer data types in the aggregation process is incomplete, leading to a TypeError when specific functions like `mean`, `median`, and `var` are called.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to enhance the handling of nullable integer data types within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to allow smooth aggregation operations without encountering TypeError in cases like `mean`, `median`, and `var`.

### Corrected Version:
Here is a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function with improvements to handle nullable integer data types correctly:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        if pd.api.types.is_list_like(block.values):
            result = getattr(block.values, how)(fillna=alt)
        else:
            result = block.values
        agg_block = block.make_block(result)
        
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version includes improvements to handle different data types correctly during aggregation, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
