### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class.
2. The function has several operations related to aggregating data for a `DataFrameGroupBy` object.
3. The bug was identified in the GitHub issue "calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype results in TypeError", which is related to calling `mean()` function after grouping a DataFrame with `Int64` dtype columns.
4. The bug occurs due to the handling of nullable integer data type in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function when performing aggregation operations.
5. The strategy for fixing the bug involves proper handling of the nullable integer data type when performing aggregations, ensuring data consistency and type conversion.

### Bug Fix:
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas import DataFrame, MultiIndex

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # existing code

    for block in data.blocks:
        # existing code

        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            else:
                # handle nullable integer dtype
                if pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(block.dtype) and pd.api.types.is_nullable(block.dtype):
                    result = block._try_cast_for_bool_compat(result)
        # existing code

    # existing code

    return agg_blocks, agg_items

# Patch the buggy function _cython_agg_blocks into the DataFrameGroupBy class
DataFrameGroupBy._cython_agg_blocks = _cython_agg_blocks
```

### This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that calling `mean()` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with Int64 dtype columns does not result in a TypeError.
