### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` file.
2. The function is related to aggregating data based on certain conditions within a `DataFrameGroupBy` object.
3. The function fails when calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` dtype, resulting in a `TypeError`. This issue is documented in the GitHub issue mentioned.
4. The cause of the bug seems to be related to handling nullable integer data type (`Int64`) during aggregation.
5. The strategy for fixing this bug would involve modifying the way `nullable_int` values are handled during aggregation to prevent the `TypeError`.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs due to improper handling of `nullable_int` values (`Int64`) during the aggregation process in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.
- When calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` dtype, the function encounters an issue while handling the nullable integer values.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug related to calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` dtype, we need to ensure proper handling of nullable integer values during aggregation.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            deleted_items.append(locs)
            continue

        if isinstance(result, pd.DataFrame):
            result = result.to_numpy()

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
            new_items.append(locs)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.argsort(indexer))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version ensures proper handling of the result during aggregation and conversion of `DataFrame` result to a numpy array when needed. This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
