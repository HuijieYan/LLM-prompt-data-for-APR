Upon analyzing the buggy function and the related GitHub issue, it is evident that the bug arises when calling the `mean` function after grouping a DataFrame with columns of `dtype='Int64'`. The bug leads to a TypeError, and the affected functions include `mean`, `median`, and `std`, while functions like `min`, `max`, and `first` work correctly.

The bug occurs due to the implementation of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. The function fails to handle the aggregation operations properly for columns with `dtype='Int64'`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the aggregation operation for `dtype='Int64'` columns is handled correctly in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. This involves proper type handling and aggregation logic for nullable integer columns.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function based on the provided expected values and the GitHub issue:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values,
            how,
            axis=1,
            min_count=min_count,
            dtype=block.dtype,
        )

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version ensures proper handling of nullable integer columns during aggregation operations in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. It addresses the TypeError issue mentioned in the GitHub problem description.

Please test this corrected version with the provided test cases and confirm if it resolves the bug effectively.
