## Bug Analysis
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class which inherits from `GroupBy`.
2. The function is meant to handle aggregation operations on numeric data within a `BlockManager`.
3. The bug seems to be related to TypeError when calling mean on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with the Int64 dtype.
4. The bug may be caused by an issue in the handling of numeric data when performing aggregation operations.
5. The bug needs to be fixed to ensure that mean aggregation works correctly with the Int64 dtype.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle the case of mean aggregation with the Int64 dtype correctly.
2. Ensure that appropriate data conversions and type handling are performed within the function to avoid the TypeError.
3. Verify the handling of numeric data during aggregation to align with the expected behavior.
4. Make sure the function returns the expected results for mean aggregation with the Int64 dtype.

## Bug Fix - Corrected Version
```python
# Corrected version of the _cython_agg_blocks function
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            # Use an if branch specific for mean aggregation with Int64 dtype
            if how == 'mean' and block.dtype.name == 'Int64':
                result = block.values.astype('float64').mean()
                result = np.array([[result]])
            else:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Error handling code
            # Continue processing if NotImplementedError is raised

    # Rest of the function implementation remains the same

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By ensuring proper handling of mean aggregation with the Int64 dtype, this corrected version of the function should address the TypeError issue reported in the GitHub bug.
