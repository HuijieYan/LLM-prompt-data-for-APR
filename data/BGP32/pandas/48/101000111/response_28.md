### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is designed to perform aggregation operations on grouped data. It involves processing blocks of data and creating new aggregated blocks.
2. The bug might be related to how the function handles the result of the aggregation operation and constructs the aggregated blocks.
3. Based on the GitHub issue, the problem arises when calling aggregation functions like `mean`, `median`, `std` on a DataFrameGroupBy object with the Int64 dtype, leading to a TypeError.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles the aggregated results properly and constructs the appropriate output.

### Bug Cause:
The bug might be caused by the incorrect handling of the aggregated results when calling aggregation functions like `mean`, `median`, `std` on a DataFrameGroupBy object with the Int64 dtype.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check how the aggregation results are processed and converted to the final aggregated block.
2. Ensure that the handling of the aggregated results is consistent for different aggregation functions and data types.
3. Validate the construction of the aggregated blocks to match the expected output.

### Proposed Fix:
```python
# Fix the buggy function _cython_agg_blocks

def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
        
        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

        for block in data.blocks:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=self.axis, min_count=min_count
            )
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

        agg_items = data.items[pd.Series(np.concatenate(new_items)).sort_values().index.values]

        if not agg_blocks:
            raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By simplifying the aggregation logic to process each block, create the aggregated blocks, and adjust the items accordingly, this updated function aims to address the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
