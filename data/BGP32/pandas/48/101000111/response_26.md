The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` has issues related to handling the grouping operation and aggregating data. The function encounters a TypeError when trying to perform aggregation operations with the nullable integer data type.

### Problem:
The bug occurs when calling the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to aggregate data from a DataFrameGroupBy object, specifically when grouping on a nullable integer column (`Int64` dtype) and using aggregation functions like mean, median, and std.

1. The function encounters a TypeError due to the interaction between the nullable integer data type and certain aggregation operations.
2. The function doesn't handle the nullable integer dtype properly during aggregation, leading to unexpected errors.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to address how the function processes the nullable integer data type during aggregation operations. We should ensure that the nullable integer data type is handled correctly to avoid errors during aggregation.

### Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = block._try_aggregate(how, min_count=min_count)
        if result is not None:
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)
    
    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = BlockPlacement(indexer[offset : (offset + loc)])
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

The corrected function uses the `_try_aggregate` method to handle aggregation operations on nullable integer data types properly. It iterates over the blocks of data, applies the aggregation operation, and constructs the aggregated blocks accordingly.

By fixing the handling of nullable integer data types during aggregation, the function should now be able to handle the DataFrameGroupBy aggregation without encountering a TypeError for nullable integer columns.

This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub regarding calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype resulting in a TypeError.
