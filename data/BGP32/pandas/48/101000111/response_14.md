The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is related to the handling of nullable integer dtype columns when calling the `mean` function after grouping in a `DataFrameGroupBy` object. This bug causes a `TypeError` to be raised. The issue on GitHub describes the problem where calling the `mean` function after grouping results in a `TypeError` when using the new nullable integer data type (`Int64`).

The cause of the bug seems to be related to the handling of nullable integer dtype columns within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, specifically in the computation of the mean value. In the case of nullable integer columns, the bug leads to an error due to incorrect calculations.

To fix the bug, we need to address the handling of nullable integer columns when computing aggregate functions like mean inside the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. The correction involves ensuring proper handling of nullable integer dtype columns to prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.

Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.convert(
            objects=True, 
            numeric_only=numeric_only, 
            copy=False
        )
    
    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self._grouped_agg_block(block, how=how, min_count=min_count)
        if result is not None:
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
    
    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)
    
    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : offset + loc]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, we ensure proper handling of nullable integer columns by converting the data before performing the aggregation. This approach aims to address the `TypeError` that occurs when computing aggregate functions on nullable integer columns within the `DataFrameGroupBy` object.

This correction should resolve the issue described in the GitHub problem statement related to calling the `mean` function after grouping on nullable integer columns.
