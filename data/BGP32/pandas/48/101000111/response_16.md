After analyzing the buggy function and the provided GitHub issue, the bug seems to be related to calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with columns of the `Int64` data type, resulting in a `TypeError`. The issue arises due to improper handling of the data types inside the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

The bug occurs specifically when trying to aggregate data with the `mean`, `median`, `var`, or `std` functions on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` columns. The issue does not manifest when using other aggregation functions like `min`, `max`, or `first`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure proper handling of nullable integer data types (`Int64`) when performing aggregation operations in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. Specifically, the bug may be related to incorrect type conversions or handling of `Int64` data during aggregation.

Below is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )
        
        if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            # Unwrap the result DataFrame to get the values
            result = result.values

        agg_block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Adjust locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version should handle nullable integer data types (`Int64`) properly during aggregation operations, resolving the `TypeError` issue when calling aggregation functions like `mean`, `median`, `var`, or `std` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` columns.

Please test this corrected version with the provided test cases to ensure it behaves as expected and resolves the bug mentioned in the GitHub issue.
