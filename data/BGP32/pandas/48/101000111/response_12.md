### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is responsible for aggregating data based on certain criteria specified by `how` and `numeric_only` parameters.
2. The bug occurs when calling certain aggregation functions like 'mean', 'median', 'var', and 'std' with nullable integer data types (`Int64`). This leads to a `TypeError`.
3. The issue on GitHub highlights the problem when calling `mean` after grouping `Int64` dtype data.
4. The bug is likely because the function does not handle nullable integer data types properly during aggregation functions that involve calculation.
5. The expected output should be the mean of 'b' column grouped by 'a'.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Convert the nullable integer data to a supported type for aggregation calculations that can handle nullable values, such as handling the possibility of `NA` values during computation of mean, median, etc.
- Check for nullable integer data types and appropriately handle aggregation calculations to avoid `TypeError`.

### Bug Fix:
Below is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        if block.dtype.name == 'Int64':
            block_values = block.values.to_numpy()
        else:
            block_values = block.values

        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block_values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Handle aggregation functions that are not implemented
            pass

        # Rest of the code remains the same

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Rest of the code remains the same

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By properly handling nullable integer data types in aggregation calculations, the function should now handle mean, median, var, and std operations without raising a `TypeError`.
