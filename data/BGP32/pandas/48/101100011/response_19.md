### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class within the `pandas.core.groupby.generic` module is responsible for the issue described in the GitHub report.
2. The function is intended to perform aggregation on numeric data but encounters errors when dealing with object-dtype blocks and split blocks, leading to TypeError in certain cases.
3. The issue reported on GitHub is related to calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype resulting in a TypeError, which aligns with the buggy behavior described in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.
4. The bug occurs when attempting to aggregate particular columns with certain functions that are not directly applicable to the data, causing unexpected handling of input data types.
5. To fix the bug, we need to handle object-dtype blocks and split blocks properly during aggregation to prevent the TypeError and ensure correct behavior when aggregating data.

### Strategy for Fix:
1. Adjust the logic in `_cython_agg_blocks` function to properly handle object-dtype blocks and split blocks, ensuring that the aggregation process works correctly for all data types.
2. Implement conditional checks to detect and avoid issues related to data types that are not compatible with the chosen aggregation method.
3. Update the error handling mechanism to gracefully handle exceptions and exclude problematic blocks from the aggregation process.
4. Ensure that the final aggregation output retains the correct data type and structure to match the expected result.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Handle non-applicable functions
            if alt is None:
                if how == "ohlc":
                    deleted_items.append(locs)
                    continue
            else:
                result = alt(block.values, axis=self.axis)
                result = maybe_convert_objects(result)
        
        if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            result = result._data.blocks[0].values

        if result is not None:
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
            new_items.append(locs)

    if not (agg_blocks):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

### Updated Changes:
1. Added proper conversion for non-numeric data using `maybe_convert_objects`.
2. Simplified exception handling for non-applicable functions.
3. Fixed handling of DataFrame objects and their values during aggregation.
4. Adjusted the logic to properly append valid aggregation results to `agg_blocks`.
5. Updated the indexer and agg_items calculations for correct ordering of aggregated data.

With these modifications, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should now handle different data types during aggregation, resolving the TypeError issue reported on GitHub.
