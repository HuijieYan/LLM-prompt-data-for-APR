### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is a method of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the file `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py`.
2. The function is responsible for aggregating data based on specified criteria, but it is failing in certain cases.
3. The GitHub issue `calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype results in TypeError` is linked to this bug.
4. The bug seems to be related to handling of numeric data with nullable integer dtype.
5. The function is expected to aggregate numeric data, but it encounters TypeErrors in certain scenarios.
6. The issue might be due to incorrect handling of nullable integers during aggregation.

### Error Location:
- The error could potentially occur during the aggregation process when dealing with nullable integer data.
- The use of `maybe_downcast_numeric` and data type conversions might be causing issues.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug might be caused by the handling of nullable integer data types during numeric aggregation.
- The function is unable to correctly process nullable integers in certain scenarios, leading to exceptions.
- This causes the function to raise TypeErrors when trying to perform aggregation operations.

### Proposed Fix Strategy:
- Check the handling of nullable integers during aggregation.
- Ensure that the function can safely process nullable integer data types.
- Consider modifying the data type conversion logic to handle nullable integers more effectively.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Handle non-applicable functions here
            deleted_items.append(locs)
            continue
        
        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result, convert_numeric=True)
            agg_block: Block = make_block(result, block.items, block.ref_items)

            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items).argsort()
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    # Handle deleted items to adjust indexer
    for items in deleted_items:
        indexer = indexer[indexer != items]

    for i, blk in enumerate(agg_blocks):
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[blk.mgr_locs.as_array]
    
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

### Note:
- The corrected version aims to address issues related to handling nullable integer data during aggregation.
- The changes include using `maybe_convert_objects` for safer conversions and adjusting indexers accordingly.
- This corrected version should help resolve the bug and pass the failing test mentioned in the GitHub issue.
