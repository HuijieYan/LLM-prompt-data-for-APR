### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the `generic.py` file, which inherits from `GroupBy`.
- The function is responsible for performing aggregation based on the specified `how` method, with additional parameters like `numeric_only` and `min_count`.
- The function iterates over the data blocks and aggregates the values, handling exceptions and different scenarios.
- The bug seems related to handling data with the nullable integer dtype 'Int64' when calling mean, median, or var functions after grouping.

### Bug Description:
- The bug arises when trying to call mean, median, or var functions on a DataFrameGroupBy object with nullable integer values ('Int64').
- The bug occurs due to the way the function handles the calculation and dtype conversion while performing aggregation operations on the data blocks.
- The bug is closely related to the GitHub issue mentioned, where calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with 'Int64' dtype results in a TypeError.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- We need to ensure proper handling of nullable integer dtype 'Int64' values during aggregation operations to avoid the TypeError.
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the aggregation blocks are processed and converted to the correct data type after the aggregation is performed.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

        if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            result = result.to_numpy()  # Convert to NumPy array for handling nullable Int64

        # Downcast the result to the appropriate dtype
        result = maybe_convert_objects(result)

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No valid types to aggregate")

    new_mgr_locs = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(new_mgr_locs)

    for offset, blk in enumerate(agg_blocks):
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = new_mgr_locs[offset : offset + loc]

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

### Summary:
- The corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function addresses the bug related to handling nullable integer dtype 'Int64' values during aggregation.
- It ensures proper conversion to NumPy arrays and downcasting of the results to the appropriate dtype to prevent any TypeErrors.
- With this fix, the function should now pass the failing test cases related to nullable integer aggregation operations.
