### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class is responsible for the error described in the GitHub issue related to calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype.
2. The bug is likely caused by a TypeError due to incorrect handling of nullable integer data type (`Int64`) during aggregation.

### Bug Location:
The bug is likely located in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function where aggregation is performed on the data. Specifically, the error could be related to the handling of nullable integer data during aggregation, leading to a TypeError.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely causing a TypeError when trying to perform aggregation operations on `Int64` dtype data using the `mean` function in a `DataFrameGroupBy`. This issue arises due to improper handling of nullable integer data types in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure proper handling of nullable integer data during aggregation operations.
2. Check for cases where the dtype is `Int64` and adjust the aggregation process accordingly.
3. Debug the function to identify the specific point where the TypeError occurs and apply appropriate type conversions or checks.

### Corrected Version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Handle case of non-numeric aggregation
            continue

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

Applying this corrected version should address the issue described in the GitHub bug report related to calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype.
