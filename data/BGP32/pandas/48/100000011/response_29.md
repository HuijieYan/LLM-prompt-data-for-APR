### Analysis:
The bug is related to calling the `mean()` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` dtype, which results in a `TypeError`. This is occurring because the `_cython_agg_blocks` function does not handle the `Int64` dtype correctly during aggregation.

### Error Locations:
1. The issue arises when attempting to aggregate values using the `mean()` function, which typically involves numerical operations.
2. The bug affects operations where the result is expected to be an ndarray, leading to conversion errors due to the `Int64` dtype.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by improper handling of the `Int64` dtype during aggregation operations in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. The dtype mismatch leads to a `TypeError` when trying to perform numerical calculations.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `Int64` dtype is handled correctly during aggregation operations. Specifically, when calling the `mean()` function, we need to properly convert the result to the expected numerical type.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.convert_to_values(), how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

        result = maybe_convert_objects(result)

        result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, data.items.take(np.sort(np.concatenate(new_items)))
```

In the corrected version, we handle the `Int64` dtype correctly by converting the block values to the expected numerical type before performing aggregation. Additionally, we ensure that the result is properly downcasted to avoid dtype compatibility issues.
