### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is related to the issue of calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype which results in a `TypeError`.
- The issue states that using the new nullable integer data type `Int64`, calling `mean` after grouping results in a `TypeError`. Specifically, it mentions that the error does not occur when calling `min`, `max`, or `first`, but does occur with `median` and `std`.

### Potential Error Locations:
- The issue seems related to the handling of data types within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, specifically during the aggregation process.
- There might be issues with casting or downcasting data types that lead to the `TypeError` when calling `mean` with `Int64` dtype.

### Cause of the Bug:
The buggy function might not be handling the nullable integer data type `Int64` correctly during aggregation operations. This could lead to a situation where the aggregation functions like `mean`, `median`, and `std` encounter a `TypeError` due to improper type handling.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that proper handling of `Int64` data type is implemented in the aggregation process.
2. Verify that casting and downcasting operations are performed appropriately to prevent `TypeError` when calling aggregation functions.
3. Check for any assumptions made about data types or structures which might not hold true for nullable integer data types.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Based on the analysis, the corrected version of the function should address the handling of `Int64` data type during aggregation. Here's a potential fix for the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self._aggregate_block(block, how, alt, min_count)
        agg_block = self._make_agg_block(block, result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # resetting locs in the blocks
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(np.concatenate(new_items)))
    
    return agg_blocks, agg_items

def _aggregate_block(self, block: Block, how: str, alt=None, min_count: int = -1) -> Any:
    locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
    try:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
    except NotImplementedError:
        # Handle non-applicable functions - try alternate way or exclude block
        result = self._aggregate_block_alternate(block, alt)
    return result

def _aggregate_block_alternate(self, block: Block, alt: Callable) -> Any:
    # implement the alternate aggregation method here
    return alt(block.values, axis=self.axis)

def _make_agg_block(self, block: Block, result: Any) -> Block:
    # handle casting and conversions based on the result
    agg_block = block.make_block(maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, block.dtype))
    return agg_block
```

This corrected version aims to properly handle the `Int64` data type during aggregation operations and ensures that casting and conversions are done appropriately to prevent `TypeError`. Make sure to test this fix against the mentioned issue to confirm the resolution.
