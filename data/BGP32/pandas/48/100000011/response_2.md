### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is a method from the `pandas` library which is related to aggregation of data within a `GroupBy` object.
- The GitHub issue mentions a problem when calling `.mean()` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` dtype, resulting in a `TypeError`.
- The issue is due to an error in handling the `Int64` dtype cases during aggregation operations.

### Potential error locations:
1. Handling of `Int64` dtype in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.
2. Type conversion issues when casting results back to the original dtype.
3. Handling of split blocks in the `split_frames` section of the function.

### Cause of the bug:
- The bug occurs when trying to aggregate data with `Int64` dtype in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. This causes a `TypeError` due to inconsistencies in processing and casting when dealing with the `Int64` data type.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Update the function to properly handle `Int64` dtype during aggregation operations.
- Ensure correct type conversion and casting when dealing with `Int64` data.
- Handle all potential scenarios, including split blocks, in a consistent manner.

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.argsort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        indexer = np.array([i for i in indexer if i not in deleted])

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
