### Analysis:
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is related to a GitHub issue where calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype results in a TypeError. The issue seems to be related to the handling of the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) in the aggregation process.

### Issues in the buggy function:
1. In the function, the way numeric data is processed and aggregated might not handle nullable integer data types (`Int64`) correctly.
2. The function might not be properly handling the nullable integer data type input when performing aggregation operations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the function is likely due to the handling of the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) when performing aggregation operations within the pandas library. The bug results in a TypeError when attempting to aggregate nullable integer data types using certain methods like mean, median, and std.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) is correctly handled during the aggregation process. This might involve updating how the data is processed and aggregated to account for nullable integer values.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array

        # Check for nullable integer data type
        if block.dtype == 'Int64':
            block_values = block.values.astype(np.float64)
        else:
            block_values = block.values

        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block_values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Handle the aggregation error
            raise NotImplementedError("Aggregation method not implemented")

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    # Adjust the indexer to account for removed items
    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

### Summary:
The corrected function includes handling the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) appropriately during the aggregation process to avoid the TypeError issue when calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy. This fix should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
