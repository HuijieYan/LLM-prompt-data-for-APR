### Analysis:
The bug occurs when calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy object with `Int64` dtype. The issue is related to the handling of nullable integer data type in pandas, which results in a `TypeError`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of `dtype='Int64'` in the DataFrame creation.
2. Aggregation process inside the `_cython_agg_blocks` function includes downcasting and handling different data types.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused due to the wrong handling of nullable integer data type, specifically when calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy object. The `TypeError` occurs due to a mismatch in data types during the aggregation process inside the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Verify the data type compatibility during aggregation.
2. Ensure proper handling of nullable integer data type during mean aggregation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas.core.internals.blocks import Block

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], pd.Index]:
    
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[int] = []
    deleted_items: List[int] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Handle aggregation based on dtype
            
            if alt is None:
                # Handle special 'ohlc' case
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            result = s.agg(how)

        assert not isinstance(result, pd.DataFrame)

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result.values, ndim=result.ndim)

        new_items += locs
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    for i, block in enumerate(agg_blocks):
        block.mgr_locs = np.array(new_items[i])

    return agg_blocks, data.items
        
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by ensuring proper handling of data types during aggregation and correct processing of nullable integer data type.
