## Analysis:
The provided code is a part of the Pandas library that deals with aggregating data in a pandas DataFrame after grouping it based on some criteria. The issue reported on GitHub mentions a problem with calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype, resulting in a TypeError. The reported error is related to handling the nullable integer data type.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The error could be related to how the `maybe_downcast_numeric` function is handling the result data types.
2. Error handling logic may not be handling the nullable integer data type correctly.
3. The issue seems to occur when trying to aggregate the data using the `mean` function and result in a DataFrame rather than a single block output.

## Cause of Bug:
The bug arises due to a mismatch between the calculations performed within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function and the handling of nullable integer data type in the given DataFrame. The function is not handling the aggregation of nullable integer data type correctly during operations like calling the `mean` function.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Identify the location where the nullable integer data type is not handled correctly.
2. Ensure that the function properly handles the nullable integer data type while aggregating the data.
3. Check if any downcasting of data types is causing the issue, especially in the context of nullable integers.
4. Update the aggregation logic to handle nullable integer data types correctly.

## Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
   
    for block in data.blocks:
        
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError as err:
            if alt is None:
                raise err
            else:
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                try:
                    result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                except TypeError:
                    deleted_items.append(locs)
                    continue
                
        
        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
    
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)
   
    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

Ensure this corrected version is tested thoroughly, specifically with nullable integer data types, to confirm that the bug has been fixed successfully.
