### Analysis:
The bug identified in the GitHub issue relates to calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype resulting in a TypeError. The issue occurs when using the new nullable integer data type 'Int64' while grouping and calling mean, median, or std functions. The bug stems from handling the nullable integer data type within the _cython_agg_blocks function in the pandas library.

### Error Locations:
1. The current implementation does not handle the case of `np.ndarray` of dtype 'Int64' appropriately when performing operations like mean on DataFrameGroupBy objects.
2. The function does not consider the nullable integer dtype ('Int64') in the logic of downcasting or aggregating the blocks.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function not properly handling the nullable integer dtype 'Int64' while performing aggregation operations like mean within a GroupBy object. The error arises due to incorrect handling of the nullable integer type in computing the result for the aggregation operation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles the nullable integer dtype 'Int64' when performing aggregation operations. Specifically, check for the dtype 'Int64' and handle it appropriately when computing the result for the aggregation operation.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the _cython_agg_blocks function which correctly handles the nullable integer dtype 'Int64' when performing aggregation operations:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

        if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            result = result._data.blocks[0].values
            if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
                result = result.reshape(1, -1)
        
        if np.issubdtype(result.dtype, np.integer):
            # Downcast the result if necessary for Int64 dtype
            result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, data.dtypes[block.mgr_locs[0]])
        
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs)
    
    if not (agg_blocks):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
    
    # Update the locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

### Summary:
By updating the _cython_agg_blocks function to handle the nullable integer dtype 'Int64' appropriately when performing aggregation operations, the bug related to calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype resulting in a TypeError should be resolved. This corrected version ensures that the function can handle the nullable integer data type correctly and compute the result for aggregation operations without errors.
