### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is related to the GitHub issue "calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype results in TypeError."
- The error seems to be occurring due to an issue in processing the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) during aggregation operations like `mean`.
- The function is mainly responsible for aggregating data within grouped blocks.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of nullable integer data type (`Int64`) during aggregation.
2. Casting numeric data to the original dtype after aggregation.
3. Dealing with split blocks and splitting the object-dtype blocks.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely related to the handling of nullable integer data type (`Int64`) within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. When calling aggregation functions like `mean` on a DataFrameGroupBy with `Int64` dtype, it results in a `TypeError` due to improper handling of the data type during aggregation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure proper handling of nullable integer data type (`Int64`) during aggregation operations.
2. Check if there are issues with casting aggregated data back to the original dtype.
3. Address any discrepancies in handling split blocks or object-dtype blocks during aggregation.

### Corrected Version:
Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result

        if data.__class__.__name__ == "IntBlock" and str(data.dtype).startswith("Int"):
            # check if the block contains nullable integer type
            alt = alt.astype(np.float64)
        
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
        
        if result is not no_result:
            # cast the block back to the original dtype
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            
            if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                try:
                    result = type(block.values)._from_sequence(
                        result.ravel(), dtype=block.values.dtype
                    )
                except ValueError:
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)
            
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs)

        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
    
    # rest of the code unchanged

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version addresses the issue related to `Int64` datatype by properly handling the conversion to `np.float64` during aggregation operations like `mean`. This should resolve the `TypeError` that occurs when calling `mean` on a DataFrameGroupBy with nullable integer data type (`Int64`).
