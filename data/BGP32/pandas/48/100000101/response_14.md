The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is intended to aggregate data based on specified criteria, such as mean, median, or variance. The bug seems to be related to how the results are handled and stored in the `agg_blocks` list.

The bug likely occurs due to incorrect handling of the result in the case where `how` is not supported by the function and `alt` is provided. The function attempts to process the result further, expecting it to be a DataFrame when in reality, it could be a NumPy array.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the code to correctly handle cases where the result is not a DataFrame but a NumPy array. We should remove unnecessary assumptions about the result type and keep the type checking more flexible.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is not None:
                try:
                    result = alt(block.values, axis=1)
                except TypeError:
                    deleted_items.append(locs)
                    continue
        
        if result is not no_result and result is not None:
            result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, block.dtype)
            
            if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
                result = result.reshape(1, -1)
            
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our
    # current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version should handle cases where the result is a NumPy array and ensure proper aggregation.
