The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is expected to aggregate data based on the input parameters and return a list of aggregated blocks and corresponding items. The function is supposed to handle certain calculations based on the provided data. However, due to some issues in the implementation, the function may produce incorrect results or raise errors.

To fix the bug in the function, we need to correct the logic for handling the aggregation of data blocks. Some potential issues include incorrect calculations or improper handling of data types.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.select_dtypes(include=[np.number])

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        
        if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            result = result.values
            
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
        
    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    return agg_blocks, data.items.take(np.concatenate(new_items))
```

In the corrected version, we have made the following changes:
1. Used the `select_dtypes` method to filter only numeric data if `numeric_only` is `True`.
2. Simplified the aggregation process by directly calling `self.grouper.aggregate()` and handling the result appropriately.
3. Adjusted the creation of the aggregated block and updated the items list.
4. Removed unnecessary error handling and cleanup code for the split blocks.

By applying these modifications, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should now correctly aggregate the data blocks based on the input parameters and return the expected results for each test case provided.
