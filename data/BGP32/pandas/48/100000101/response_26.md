The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is designed to aggregate data based on specified criteria. However, there is a bug in handling the aggregation results, which leads to incorrect output. The issue arises when the result of the aggregation is cast to a DataFrame in some cases. This casting can cause errors in reshaping the data correctly.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the result of the aggregation is appropriately handled to maintain the expected output structure. Specifically, we need to address cases where the result is cast to a DataFrame and ensure that the reshaping is done correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = None
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

        if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            result = result.to_numpy()

        result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.argsort(indexer))

    for idx, (locs, block) in enumerate(zip(new_items, agg_blocks)):
        length = len(block.mgr_locs)
        block.mgr_locs = BlockPlacement(slice(idx, idx+1, 1))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version ensures that the aggregation results are correctly reshaped and appended to the `agg_blocks` list. The function now handles pandas DataFrame results appropriately to avoid issues with reshaping the data.

This corrected function should now satisfy all the expected input/output values for the given test cases.
