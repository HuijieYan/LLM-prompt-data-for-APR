The buggy function is intended to aggregate blocks based on specified criteria, such as mean or variance. However, there is a bug present that causes incorrect values to be generated and returned.

The main issue lies in the handling of different types of aggregation operations and the creation of aggregate blocks. In some cases, the function fails to properly construct the aggregated block, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to address the following points:

1. Ensure consistency in handling different types of aggregation operations.
2. Properly create the aggregated block based on the result obtained from the aggregation operation.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                raise NotImplementedError
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                raise TypeError
            else:
                result = cast(DataFrame, result)
                result = result._data.blocks[0].values

        result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the issues related to incorrect block aggregation and ensures that the correct aggregated blocks are generated based on the specified aggregation operation.
