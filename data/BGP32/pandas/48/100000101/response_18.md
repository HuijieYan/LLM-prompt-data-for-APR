The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is supposed to aggregate data blocks based on specified parameters. The function encounters issues when trying to perform aggregation on certain input data and aggregation methods. The bug arises due to incorrect handling of data blocks during the aggregation process, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the aggregation process is properly handled for all cases, including scenarios where the aggregation method fails or requires alternative processing.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array

        if alt is not None:
            try:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
            except NotImplementedError:
                obj = self.obj[locs].iloc[:, 0]
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                result = result.unstack()
            finally:
                result = result.to_numpy()

        else:
            try:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
            except NotImplementedError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

        agg_block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    return agg_blocks, data.items
```

This corrected version addresses the issue of handling alternative aggregation methods and ensures that the aggregation process results in the expected data blocks. It properly handles cases where an aggregation method fails or alternative processing is required based on the input data.

Please test this corrected function with the provided expected input/output cases to validate its functionality.
