The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is designed to aggregate data blocks based on specified methods like mean, median, or variance. The function encounters a bug that leads to incorrect calculations during aggregation, potentially resulting in wrong output values or exceptions.

The bug arises from the handling of the `result` variable within the loop where data blocks are processed. There is a lack of distinction between cases where the `result` should be considered valid or if an exception occurred during aggregation, leading to inconsistent processing.

To fix the bug, we need to properly manage the `result` variable and handle exceptions in a more structured way.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
from pandas.core.dtypes.cast import maybe_convert_objects, maybe_downcast_numeric, maybe_downcast_to_dtype
from pandas.core.base import DataError
from pandas.core.frame import DataFrame
from pandas.core.internals import Block, BlockManager 
from pandas.core.groupby.groupby import get_groupby

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array

        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                raise NotImplementedError("Alternate aggregation method not provided")
            
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            result = cast(DataFrame, result)

        if not isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)

            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version of the function ensures proper handling of results and exceptions during the aggregation process, providing accurate output values for the specified methods like mean, median, or variance.
