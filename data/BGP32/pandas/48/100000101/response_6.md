After analyzing the provided buggy function and expected input/output values, it seems that the bug lies in the way the function is handling the result when the aggregation method is not implemented. The function fails to exclude the block when the 'how' parameter is 'ohlc' and the alternate method is not provided.

To fix the bug, we need to properly exclude the block when the condition is not met. We can achieve this by adding an explicit check for 'how == "ohlc"' and no alternate method provided. In this case, we can directly append the locs to the deleted_items list without further processing.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    # Some object-dtype blocks might be split into List[Block[T], Block[U]]
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if how == "ohlc" and alt is None:
                # Exclude the block when 'how' is 'ohlc' and no alternate method is provided
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            # the rest of the code remains the same

```

This corrected function should handle the case where the 'how' parameter is 'ohlc' and there is no alternate method provided, excluding the block properly. Let me know if you need further assistance or more clarification.
