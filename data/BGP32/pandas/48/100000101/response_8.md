The buggy function is failing due to a logic error in handling the aggregation of blocks. The function is trying to aggregate values based on a specified method (`how`) while considering whether to perform the aggregation only on numeric data (`numeric_only`) and a minimum count (`min_count`). 

The main issue seems to be in the handling of the results after aggregation, specifically in constructing the aggregated block. There are cases when the function checks for an alternate aggregation method (`alt`) and splits object-dtype blocks, which complicates the data handling process and results in incorrect aggregation.

To fix this bug, we can simplify the handling of the results, avoid splitting object-dtype blocks unnecessarily, and ensure that we correctly construct the aggregated block.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt: Callable, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        
        if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            result_values = result.values
        else:
            result_values = result
        
        agg_block = block.make_block(result_values)
        
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    agg_items = data.items.take(np.concatenate(new_items))
    
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version simplifies the result handling by constructing the aggregated block directly from the result values without unnecessary splitting. It iterates over each block, aggregates the values, constructs the aggregated block, and appends them to the respective lists. Finally, it creates the new data items and returns the aggregated blocks and items as expected.
