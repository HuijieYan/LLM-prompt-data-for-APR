The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function lies in how the result is handled when an exception is caught in the try-except block. The issue arises when trying to convert the result to an aggregate block. If the result is not an instance of DataFrame, the function incorrectly proceeds to create an aggregate block without proper validation, resulting in incorrect output.

To fix this bug, the code should check if the result is an instance of DataFrame before proceeding to create an aggregate block. If the result is not a DataFrame, it should skip creating the aggregate block and continue with the next iteration.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
from pandas import Index, FloatBlock

def _cython_agg_blocks(self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks = []
    new_items = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        except NotImplementedError:
            deleted_items.append(locs)
            continue

        if isinstance(result, Index) or len(locs) != result.shape[1]:
            deleted_items.append(locs)
            continue

        result = result.values
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_block = FloatBlock(locs, result, dtype=result.dtype)

        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    return agg_blocks, data.items.take(np.concatenate(new_items))
```

This fix ensures that the aggregation process is correctly handled even if the result is not a DataFrame or the expected shape, preventing unexpected behavior and maintaining the integrity of the output data.
