The bug in the given function is related to the improper handling of aggregation results and blocks. This bug affects the calculation and assignment of aggregated blocks, leading to incorrect results.

The root cause of the bug lies in the handling of the result after aggregation. The function fails to correctly create the new Blocks based on the aggregation result and manage the indices of the aggregated blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct blocks are created from the aggregation result and the indices are properly managed for the aggregated blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List = []
    deleted_items: List = []
    split_items: List = []
    split_frames: List = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]
            
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            else:
                result = result.values.reshape(1, -1)

        if result.ndim == 1:
            result = np.expand_dims(result, axis=0)

        agg_block = make_block(result, placement=block.mgr_locs)
        new_items.extend(agg_block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    return agg_blocks, data.items.take(np.concatenate(new_items))
```

This corrected version ensures that the aggregated blocks are correctly created and managed, addressing the initial bug where incorrect results were produced.
