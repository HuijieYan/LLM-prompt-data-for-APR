Based on the provided buggy function and the expected input/output values for different test cases, it seems that the buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is not handling the aggregation of data correctly when certain conditions are met. The bug might be related to how the function processes the input data and aggregates it based on the specified `how` parameter.

One strategy to fix the bug is to carefully analyze the problematic parts of the function where the aggregation is not behaving as expected. In particular, pay close attention to how the `how` parameter is utilized and ensure that the aggregation logic is correctly applied to the data. Additionally, check if any unexpected exceptions are being raised during the aggregation process.

Here is a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function that aims to address the issues and align with the expected input/output values for the test cases:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        if result is not None:
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the potential issues with the aggregation process and aims to produce the expected output values for the provided test cases.

Please test this corrected function with the given test cases to ensure that it behaves as expected and handles the aggregation of data properly. If there are any specific requirements or additional constraints for the function, feel free to provide them for further refinement.
