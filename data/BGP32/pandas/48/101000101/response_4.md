Based on the expected values and types of variables along with the input parameters, the bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function appears to be related to correctly handling the result of aggregation when `how` is not applicable. The code seems to handle this scenario by excluding blocks that throw a `NotImplementedError`, but it may fail to appropriately handle other exceptions.

To fix the bug, we should properly account for all possible exceptions during aggregation. Specifically, when an alternative computation method (`alt`) is provided and exceptions occur during aggregation, we need to catch and handle them correctly to avoid unexpected behavior such as missing data.

Here is a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            try:
                # Use alternative aggregation method
                result = alt(block.values, axis=1)
            except Exception:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            else:
                # Check and reshape DataFrame result
                if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
                    result = result._data.blocks[0].values
                    if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
                        result = result.reshape(1, -1)

        if not isinstance(result, DataFrame) and result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version of the function should now properly handle exceptions during aggregation, ensuring that the result is appropriately processed without losing data. It aligns with the expected input/output values provided in the test cases.
