The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` has issues related to exception handling and the creation of `agg_block`. The function is designed to aggregate data in a DataFrame groupby operation. The bug arises from handling exceptions related to certain operations like 'ohlc', and there is an issue with constructing the aggregated block.

The strategy to fix the bug involves correcting the exception handling logic, ensuring the proper creation of `agg_block` objects, and maintaining the consistency of the data throughout the function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None and how == "ohlc":
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis)) if alt is not None else s.agg(how)
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            agg_block = block.make_block(result)

            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.argsort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version addresses the exceptions raised during aggregation and ensures the correct creation and implementation of `agg_block` objects for grouping the data. The function now handles different aggregation functions appropriately and maintains the expected data manipulation throughout its execution.
