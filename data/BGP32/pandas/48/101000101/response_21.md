The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` seems to be encountering issues related to calculations and data management, resulting in incorrect output. The primary cause of the bug may be the incorrect handling of the result and the blocks during the aggregation process.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the aggregation process is correctly performed and the resulting data is stored in the appropriate format within the expected variables.

Here is a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=self.axis, min_count=min_count)
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is not None:
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                    obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                try:
                    result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                except TypeError:
                    deleted_items.append(locs)
                    continue
            else:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

        if result is not None:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    return agg_blocks, data.items.take(np.concatenate(new_items))
```

This corrected version ensures that the aggregation process is correctly performed based on the input parameters and that the resulting blocks are correctly added to the `agg_blocks`.

Please test this corrected version with the provided expected input/output values to verify that it produces the correct output in all cases.
