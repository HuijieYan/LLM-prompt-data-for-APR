The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` has a bug that causes issues in the aggregation process, particularly when the `how` parameter is not handled properly, leading to the function not returning the correct output in various scenarios. The function aims to aggregate data based on specified criteria, including handling different data types and handling aggregation functions not directly supported by the groupby operation.

### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the function arises from the mishandling of the `how` parameter which specifies the type of aggregation to be performed. The function does not consider cases where the aggregation method is not supported directly by the grouper, leading to unexpected behavior and potentially incorrect results.

### Bug Location:
The main bug is located in the try-except block where the aggregation is performed based on the `how` parameter. In the case where an exception is raised, the function attempts to handle it by switching to an alternate aggregation method (`alt`), but this process is not properly managed and can lead to incorrect aggregation results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the aggregation process handles all possible scenarios, including cases where the specified aggregation method is not directly supported. This can be achieved by refining the logic within the try-except block and properly distinguishing between different cases based on the `how` parameter.

### Bug Fix for `_cython_agg_blocks` function:
I will provide a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function that addresses the bug by improving the handling of different aggregation methods. The function will be updated to properly account for cases where the specified aggregation method is not directly supported and provide an appropriate fallback mechanism.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is not None:
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            else:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                try:
                    result = type(block.values)._from_sequence(result.ravel(), dtype=block.values.dtype)
                except ValueError:
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, I have added proper handling for cases where the aggregation method is not directly supported. The function now appropriately checks for the availability of an alternate aggregation method (specified by `alt`) and switches to it when necessary. This modification ensures that the function can handle various aggregation scenarios correctly and return the expected output values for different test cases.
