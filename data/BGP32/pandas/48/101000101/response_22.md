The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is failing due to a bug in the logic flow of aggregating data blocks in a pandas DataFrameGroupBy object. The main issue seems to be around handling different cases when performing aggregation.

One of the major problems in the original implementation is the misuse of exceptions in a flow control manner, i.e., catching exceptions anticipatively and making decisions based on them. This approach is error-prone and leads to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug:
1. Replace the broad `try-except` blocks with explicit condition checks to handle different scenarios.
2. Ensure that the function's logic conforms to the expected flow of block aggregation.
3. Refactor the algorithm to follow a more clear and structured path.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array

        if not self.grouper.should_aggregate(how, block.values):
            if alt is None:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            result = self.grouper.aggregate_alt(block.values, alt)
        else:
            result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how)

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
            new_items.append(locs)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Adjust the blocks and items accordingly
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.argsort(indexer))

    for i, blk in enumerate(agg_blocks):
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : offset + loc]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version of the function should pass all the provided test cases by ensuring a more structured and clear aggregation process.
