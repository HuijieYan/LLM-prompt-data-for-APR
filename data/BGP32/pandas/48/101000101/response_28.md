The bug in the provided function is related to the handling of split object-dtype blocks. The function `_cython_agg_blocks` processes blocks for aggregation, and in the case where an object-dtype block gets split into two, the subsequent processing is incorrect, leading to unexpected behavior.

The cause of the bug lies in the handling of split object-dtype blocks in the loop that aggregates data. When an object-dtype block is split, the code attempts to handle the split parts separately but fails to update the resulting arrays correctly. This leads to the creation of incorrect `agg_blocks` and `agg_items`, affecting the subsequent calculation flow.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust how split object-dtype blocks are handled in the loop. Specifically, we need to ensure that the split parts are correctly processed and combined back into the final result.

Here is a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

        if result is not None:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    # Adjust the indexer to account for items that were removed
    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = BlockPlacement(indexer[offset : offset + loc])
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version ensures that split object-dtype blocks are correctly handled and combined back into the final result. The function now properly aggregates data blocks and creates the expected `agg_blocks` and `agg_items`.

Please test this corrected version with the provided test cases to verify its functionality.
