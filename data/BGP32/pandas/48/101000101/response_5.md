The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` has several issues. Below are the identified problems:

1. The `agg_block` variable might not be assigned within the loop, but it is appended to `agg_blocks`, leading to potential issues if it is `None`.
2. The resetting of `mgr_locs` for each `Block` in `agg_blocks` might be incorrect as the indexing seems to be calculated with potential issues.
3. The block dimension handling and re-shaping logic is error-prone and may cause unexpected behavior.
4. There is a potential bug in handling the case of exceptions during the aggregation process, which might not handle specific cases correctly.

To fix these issues, the following strategies can be applied:
- Ensure that `agg_block` is properly assigned and validated before appending to `agg_blocks`.
- Review the logic of resetting `mgr_locs` to guarantee correct alignment.
- Improve the handling of reshaping and block dimension validation cases.
- Enhance exception handling and error robustness when aggregating blocks.

Below is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
    def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":

        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
        for block in data.blocks:
            result = no_result
            locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
            try:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
            except NotImplementedError:
                if alt is None:
                    deleted_items.append(locs)
                    continue

                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                    obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                try:
                    result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                except TypeError:
                    deleted_items.append(locs)
                    continue

            if result is not no_result:
                result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

                agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
                new_items.append(locs)
                agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

        if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
            raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

        indexes = np.concatenate(new_items)
        agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexes))

        offset = 0
        for blk in agg_blocks:
            loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
            blk.mgr_locs = BlockPlacement(np.arange(offset, offset + loc))
            offset += loc

        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version addresses the identified issues and aims to satisfy the expected input/output values for the mentioned test cases.
