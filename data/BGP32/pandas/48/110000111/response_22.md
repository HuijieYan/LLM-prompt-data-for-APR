The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function seems to be related to the computations performed on the grouping results, particularly when using the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) in a `DataFrame`.

The bug manifests as a `TypeError` when calling certain aggregation functions such as `mean`, `median`, and `std` after grouping by a column with `Int64` data type.

The issue described on GitHub reports that the error occurs when trying to calculate the mean on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object grouping by a column with `Int64` data type.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the computation of aggregations works correctly for all types of data, including the `Int64` data type. In this case, we will focus on handling the nullable integer data correctly when performing mean aggregation.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        mgr_locs = block.mgr_locs
        locs = mgr_locs.as_array

        # Handle nullable integer data type for aggregation
        if block.dtype.kind == 'i':
            if 'Int' in str(block.dtype):
                result = block.values.mean(skipna=True)
            else:
                result = np.nanmean(block.values, axis=1)
        else:
            result = block.values.mean(axis=1)

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # rest of the code unchanged

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This correction involves explicitly handling the nullable integer data type when calculating the mean aggregation within the grouped data. By using conditional checks on the data type before performing the mean computation, the function should now be able to handle the `Int64` data type and calculate the mean without raising a `TypeError`.

Please test this corrected version of the function with the provided test cases to ensure that it works as expected and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
