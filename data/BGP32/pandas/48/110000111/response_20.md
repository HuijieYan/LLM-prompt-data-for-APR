### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class is designed to manage aggregation of blocks within the `GroupBy` object.
2. The function processes data blocks for aggregation, performing type-specific calculations based on the `how` parameter (e.g., mean, median, var).
3. The issue reported on GitHub indicates a TypeError when calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` dtype, which should result in the expected mean values for each group in the DataFrame.
4. The bug appears to be related to handling the `Int64` dtype during aggregation, leading to a TypeError and preventing calculation.
   
### Potential error locations:
1. Aggregating method calls based on `how` parameter such as mean, median, var.
2. Handling of `Int64` data type during aggregation.
   
### Bug Explanation:
The bug likely occurs due to improper handling of the `Int64` data type when performing the aggregation within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. Specifically, the function might not be correctly handling the conversion or computation related to the `Int64` data type, leading to a TypeError when performing operations like mean, median, or var.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure proper handling of `Int64` data type for aggregation functions.
2. Account for the specific behavior of `Int64` when performing calculations.
3. Verify that type conversions and operations are compatible with the data type.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.select_dtypes(include=np.number)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array

        if how in ["mean", "median", "var", "std"]:
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result, try_float=True)

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Handle split blocks if needed

    return agg_blocks, data.items.take(np.concatenate(new_items))
```   

By making the adjustments outlined above, the function should now correctly handle the `Int64` data type during aggregation, resolving the TypeError issue reported in the GitHub thread.
