### Analyzing the buggy function and the GitHub issue

The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is related to the issue of calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype resulting in a `TypeError`. The function is used within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class for aggregation in pandas.

The issue arises when trying to aggregate data with `Int64` dtype columns using `mean`. The `DataFrame` is grouped by column 'a', and the mean of column 'b' is calculated. The expected output is the mean of column 'b' for each group in column 'a.

The bug occurs due to the way the function handles the aggregation operation, resulting in a `TypeError` when calling `mean`.

### Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function

1. The bug could be related to how the function computes the mean during aggregation.
2. Issues might arise from handling the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) during the mean calculation.
3. It could be related to how the function processes the input data for aggregation.
4. Errors might occur during the aggregation process on different blocks within the data.

### Explanation of the bug cause

The bug is likely caused by a discrepancy in how the function handles `Int64` dtype data during the aggregation process. Since the issue specifically mentions problems with calculating the mean on `Int64` dtype data, it is possible that the function is not handling this data type correctly, leading to a `TypeError` during aggregation.

### Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, the function `_cython_agg_blocks` needs to be modified to handle the aggregation of `Int64` dtype data correctly, especially when calculating the mean. It might involve ensuring proper type conversions or modifications in the aggregation logic to support `Int64` data type.

### Corrected version of the buggy function

Here is a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result = block.mean(axis=1, skipna=True)
        
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result.to_numpy())

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version simplifies the aggregation process by directly computing the mean for each block in a more pandas-friendly approach. This should resolve the issue described in the GitHub report by correctly calculating the mean for `Int64` dtype data during aggregation.
