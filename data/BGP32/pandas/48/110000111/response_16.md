## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the `generic.py` file in the `pandas` library. The issue arises when calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with an `Int64` datatype. The bug triggers a `TypeError`.

In the provided cases, the function fails due to the way it handles the input `DataFrame` object with `Int64` datatype when applying the `mean` aggregation function.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the `Int64` datatype when aggregating with the `mean` function for a `DataFrameGroupBy` object. We may need to modify the way the function processes the data and aggregates the result to align with the expected behavior.

## Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    indexer = []
    for block in data.blocks:
        if np.issubdtype(block.dtype, np.number):
            result = block.values.mean(axis=1, skipna=True)
            indexer.append(block.mgr_locs)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    return agg_blocks, data.items
```

In this corrected version, we ensure that only numeric types are considered for aggregation and calculate the mean directly on the values using the `mean` method. We then create a new `Block` with the aggregated result and store it in the `agg_blocks` list. Finally, we return the aggregated blocks along with the corresponding items as expected.

This fix should resolve the issue of calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` datatype.
