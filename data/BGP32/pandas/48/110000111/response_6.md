### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function Description**:
   - The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class is used for aggregating data within a `GroupBy` object.
   - It performs aggregation based on the specified method (`how`) and parameters like `numeric_only` and `min_count`.
   - It then constructs `agg_blocks` based on the aggregation result.

2. **Error Location**:
   - The issue seems related to the calculation and aggregation logic within the function, affecting the proper processing of the data blocks.

3. **Bug Cause**:
   - The bug might be due to how the function aggregates data for the nullable integer data type (`'Int64'`), leading to a `TypeError` when calling `mean`.
   - The issue may stem from the internal processing of the aggregation which does not handle the nullable integer type correctly.

4. **Bug Fix Strategy**:
   - Check for the handling of nullable integer data in the aggregation mechanism.
   - Ensure proper type conversions or handling for nullable integers as required for the aggregation method.
   - Verify the behavior of calling `mean` for nullable integer data in the aggregation process.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function with the potential fix for handling nullable integer data in aggregation:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    # Check for nullable integer type and handle it appropriately
    if data._is_homogeneous_type("Int64"):
        data = data.disallow('null')

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )
        if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            result = result.to_numpy()
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.argsort(indexer))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version includes the handling of nullable integer data by disallowing `'null'` values before aggregation to resolve the `TypeError` issue when calling `mean` for nullable integer data.

This fix should address the bug and ensure proper aggregation for nullable integer data types.
