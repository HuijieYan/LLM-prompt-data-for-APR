### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` within the class `DataFrameGroupBy` is responsible for aggregating data blocks based on certain criteria.
2. The function takes parameters like `how` (aggregation method), `alt` (alternative method if needed), `numeric_only` (flag for numeric data only), and `min_count` (minimum count for aggregation).
3. The bug seems to be related to the aggregation of nullable integers causing a `TypeError` in certain cases, as reported in the GitHub issue.
4. The function processes data blocks, applies aggregation, and handles various exceptions related to aggregation methods.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the aggregation works correctly for nullable integers.


### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by a mismatch in the handling of nullable integers during aggregation, leading to a `TypeError` as reported in the GitHub issue.


### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check the handling of nullable integers during aggregation operations.
2. Ensure that the aggregation methods can handle nullable values correctly for both integer and nullable integer data types.


### Bug-fixed Function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result = no_result

        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None or how == "ohlc":
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)

            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
            else:
                result = cast(DataFrame, result)
                result = result._data.blocks[0].values
                if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1) 

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                try:
                    result = type(block.values)._from_sequence(
                        result.ravel(), dtype=block.values.dtype
                    )
                except ValueError:
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)

            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

This revised function aims to address the issue with nullable integers and ensure correct aggregation during the processing of data blocks within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class.
