### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` aims to aggregate data based on the provided parameters within a DataFrameGroupBy object.
- The function encounters issues when calculating the result for non-numeric data types, specifically when `dtype='Int64'` causing a `TypeError`.
- The key issue identified from the GitHub post is related to calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype resulting in a TypeError. This issue occurs with other aggregation functions like median and std as well.

### Error Location:
- The bug is likely occurring in the section where the function tries to aggregate the data using the `how` parameter, specifically when dealing with blocks that have non-numeric data types.
- The error handling for aggregation functions like mean, median, and std for non-numeric data seems to be missing or incomplete, leading to a TypeError.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is likely caused by the function not handling the `dtype='Int64'` properly when performing aggregation operations like mean, median, or std.
- This results in a TypeError when trying to perform these operations on non-numeric data types.

### Proposed Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug and address the GitHub issue, the function needs to handle the aggregation of non-numeric data types properly, especially when working with the `dtype='Int64'`. 
- Add appropriate error handling or conversion logic for non-numeric data types when aggregating.
- Make sure to handle different aggregation functions like mean, median, and std for non-numeric data types within the function.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[List[int]] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs[0]
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            obj = self.obj[block.items[0]]
            if block.dtype.name == 'Int64':
                if alt is None:
                    raise TypeError("Cannot perform operation on Int64 dtype")
            result = obj.agg(how)
        
        if result is not no_result:
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(np.array([locs]))
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs[0])
        blk.mgr_locs = BlockPlacement(slice(offset, offset + loc))
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```
In the corrected version of the function, we've added additional specific handling for the `dtype='Int64'` scenario, making sure to appropriately handle the aggregation functions for non-numeric data types.
