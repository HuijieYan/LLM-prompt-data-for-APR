### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` is meant to aggregate data based on a given function (`how`) while handling nullable integer data types and only numeric data.
2. The function encounters a bug where it fails to aggregate the data properly, leading to a `TypeError`, as described in the GitHub issue.
3. The bug seems to occur when calling certain aggregation functions such as `mean`, `median`, and `std` after grouping nullable integer data.
4. The bug stems from the handling of nullable integer data types when performing aggregation, especially with functions like `mean`.
  
### Cause of the bug:
1. The bug arises from improper handling of nullable integer data while aggregating in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.
2. The function fails to account for the nullable integer data type and processing it properly during aggregation, leading to a `TypeError` when certain aggregations like `mean` are called.
  
### Strategy to fix the bug:
1. Update the function to handle nullable integer data types appropriately during aggregation.
2. Ensure that the function can accommodate the data type while performing numeric-only operations.
3. Implement the necessary checks and conversions to support nullable integer data types during aggregation.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.convert_to_write(copy=False)  # Ensuring proper conversion

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, min_count=min_count, axis=self.axis)
        if isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
            # Handle nullable integer data
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result, convert_numeric=True)
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(np.array([block.mgr_locs.item], dtype=block.mgr_locs.dtype))
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    agg_items = data.items.take(data.items.argsort())
    
    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = BlockPlacement(np.arange(offset, offset + loc))
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should handle nullable integer data types properly during aggregation and should resolve the `TypeError` issue described in the GitHub bug report.
