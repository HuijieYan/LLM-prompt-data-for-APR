### Analysis:
Based on the error message and the GitHub issue provided, the bug seems to stem from a type casting issue where the function is trying to convert float64 values to int64, which is not possible according to the casting rules. This issue arises when calling mean, median, or var after grouping with Int64 dtype.

### Error Location:
The error is likely occurring in the function `safe_cast` where it tries to convert the values from float64 to int64, which leads to the TypeError. This function is used in the `_cython_agg_blocks` method of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the function attempting to convert float64 values to int64, which is not allowed according to the casting rules in NumPy. This issue arises when attempting to execute aggregation functions such as mean, median, or var on groups with Int64 dtype.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that we are handling the type conversion correctly. Since it's not possible to directly convert float64 to int64 with the safe casting rule, we could check the data types before casting and take appropriate actions based on the types.

### Corrected Function:
Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` method that includes a check for the data types before conversion:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Handle the case when aggregation cannot be done directly
            pass
          
        if result is not no_result:
            # Cast the block back to the original dtype
            if block.dtype.kind == 'f' and np.issubdtype(result.dtype, np.integer):
                result = np.round(result).astype(block.dtype)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # No need to explicitly handle int64 to float64 conversion

    return agg_blocks, data.items.take(np.sort(np.concatenate(new_items)))
```

By making sure that we handle the dtype conversions properly, we can avoid the TypeError when trying to cast float64 values to int64.
