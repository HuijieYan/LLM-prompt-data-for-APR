### Bug Analysis:
- The error messages indicate a failure in casting values from float64 to int64 due to non-equivalent types.
- The bug occurs in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class.
- The error is related to trying to safely cast float64 values to int64, which is not feasible.
- The DataFrameGroupBy object is failing to perform certain aggregates like mean, median, var when dealing with nullable integer data type.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by an incorrect attempt to cast float64 values to int64 during aggregation.
- The code assumes the possibility of casting different types that are not equivalent, leading to a TypeError.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that only equivalent types are cast during aggregation operations.
2. Handle the case where non-equivalent types are encountered without raising an error.
3. Modify the casting mechanism to avoid situations where cast is not feasible.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        
        # Perform aggregation considering non-equivalent types
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
    
    # Reset locs in the blocks
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    detail_metadata = getattr(data, 'detail_metadata', None)
    
    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    if detail_metadata is not None:
        # Set detail metadata in the aggregated blocks
        for blk in agg_blocks:
            blk.detail_metadata = detail_metadata

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

After applying these corrections, the function should handle the casting of values correctly during aggregation operations in the DataFrameGroupBy context.
