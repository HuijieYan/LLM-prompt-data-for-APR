### Analysis:
1. The error occurs when casting float64 to int64 according to the rule 'safe'.
2. The error originates from the `_cython_agg_blocks` function of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class.
3. The issue on GitHub indicates that calling mean on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with Int64 dtype results in a `TypeError`.
4. The specific error message is related to a casting issue when performing aggregation operations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by non-equivalent float64 data being attempted to be cast to int64 in a DataFrameGroupBy operation, resulting in a `TypeError`.

### Suggested Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to address the data type conversion mismatch between float64 and int64 in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class, ensuring that the casting is done correctly based on the data types being operated on.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            alt_result = data.items[locs].apply(alt)
            alt_results = alt_result.values if isinstance(alt_result, pd.Series) else alt_result
            result = alt_results.astype(block.values.dtype)

        if result is not no_result:
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version includes handling the casting issue between float64 and int64 by making sure to properly convert the data types based on the dtype during aggregation operations in the DataFrameGroupBy class.
