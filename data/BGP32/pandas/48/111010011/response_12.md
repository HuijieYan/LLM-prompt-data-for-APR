### Analysis:
- The bug occurs when calling the `mean()` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `dtype='Int64'`.
- The error message points to a `TypeError` where it is unable to cast from `'float64'` to `'int64'`, violating the casting rule 'safe'.
- The GitHub issue highlights the problem in detail and provides a test case confirming the bug.
- The `_cython_agg_blocks` function is responsible for handling the aggregation with integers and is where the bug is most likely located.
- The issue seems to be with the casting of float values to integers in the aggregation process.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is due to the function trying to cast float values to integers, violating the casting rule 'safe'.
- When attempting to cast from `'float64'` to `'int64'`, a `TypeError` is raised because the casting is not safe.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the function to handle the casting of float values to integers more carefully.
- Ensure that the casting is done in a way that complies with the 'safe' rule.
- Check the type of data being aggregated and handle float to int conversions appropriately.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        if alt is not None and isinstance(result, pd.DataFrame):
            result = result.apply(alt, axis=self.axis)     

        if result is not None:
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result)
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
    
    if not (agg_blocks):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    for i, blk in enumerate(agg_blocks):
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer
        
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

### Updated Comments:
- Changed the aggregation logic to handle casting issues more safely.
- Converted results to objects if needed and downcasted numeric data appropriately.

By implementing these changes, the function should correctly handle the casting of float values to integers, resolving the error seen in the test cases and the GitHub issue.
