### Bug Analysis:
1. The error message indicates a TypeError occurring during the attempt to cast array values from 'float64' to 'int64' using the safe casting rule.
2. The bug is related to calling functions like 'mean', 'median', and 'var' on a DataFrameGroupBy object with Int64 dtype columns.
3. The source of the bug can be traced to the `_cython_agg_blocks` function in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class.
4. The bug arises when the code attempts to cast float values to int data type, which fails due to non-equivalent types.
5. The issue reported on GitHub highlights that calling 'mean' on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype leads to a TypeError.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the casting of numeric values between float64 and int64 data types is handled correctly to prevent the TypeError.
2. Modify the code in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle the casting of values appropriately during aggregation.

### Code Fix:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # Existing code

    for i, block in enumerate(data.blocks):
        # Existing code

        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Exception handling code
            
        except TypeError:
            # Handle TypeError by explicitly casting to int if block dtype is object
            if block.dtype == np.dtype('O') and np.issubdtype(result.dtype, np.number):
                result = result.astype('int64')
            
        # Existing code

    # Existing code

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By adding a specific exception handler for `TypeError`, the code explicitly handles the case where the received result is of a numeric type but not equivalent to the block's dtype. The explicit casting to 'int64' in this case resolves the casting issue, preventing the TypeError from occurring.
