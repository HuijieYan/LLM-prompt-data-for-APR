### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class of `generic.py` is causing a TypeError when trying to cast float64 to int64 due to an error in casting the data types.
2. The error is triggered in the `safe_cast` function when trying to safely cast the values to the specified dtype using `astype`.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the problem when calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype, resulting in a TypeError.
4. The root cause of the bug lies in the conversion of float64 data to int64 which fails because of non-equivalence.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the attempt to directly cast float64 values to int64 using `astype` in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, which does not preserve data integrity. This results in a TypeError when attempting to do a safe cast from float64 to int64.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the casting operation from float64 to int64 is done correctly. We can modify the code to handle this conversion appropriately, ensuring that data integrity is maintained.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        try:
            # Attempt aggregation without casting
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Fallback to alternate method or skip block
            if alt is not None:
                result = block.get_values().astype(float)  # Convert to float first
                result = alt(result, axis=self.axis)  # Perform alternate operation
            else:
                continue

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result.astype(block.dtype))
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate([block.mgr_locs for block in agg_blocks])
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    for offset, blk in enumerate(agg_blocks):
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[blk.mgr_locs.array] = 1
        indexer = (np.arange(len(data)) - mask.cumsum())[indexer]
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : offset + blk.mgr_locs.shape[0]]

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, we convert the block values to float before performing alternate operations if needed. Then, we ensure that the final result is correctly cast back to the original data type. This approach maintains data integrity and avoids the TypeError when casting non-equivalent data types.

This corrected version should resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report and pass the failing test cases.
