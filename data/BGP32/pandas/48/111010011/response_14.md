### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates a `TypeError` when trying to cast an array from `float64` to `int64`.
2. The issue on GitHub mentions that calling `mean`, `median`, or `std` on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype results in TypeError.
3. The bug is likely related to the dtype conversion between float and int when performing aggregation functions on DataFrameGroupBy.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when calling aggregation functions on a DataFrameGroupBy object with Int64 dtype data. The error message indicates that there is a TypeError when trying to cast an array from 'float64' to 'int64' according to the rule 'safe'. This suggests an issue with dtype conversion during aggregation operations.

The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` in pandas' generic.py file is causing this conversion issue when trying to cast values to the specified dtype. Since the error is related to conversion from float to int, it could be due to the implicit conversion during mean, median, or var operations on Int64 data.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper handling of conversions between float and Int64 data types during aggregation operations. This involves modifying the dtype casting logic within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle the safe casting scenario properly.

### Bug Fix:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    no_result = object()
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array

        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is not None:
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]].iloc[:, 0]
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                
                result = s.apply(alt, axis=self.axis)
                
        assert not isinstance(result, DataFrame)

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    for i, blk in enumerate(agg_blocks):
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[block.indexer[i] : block.indexer[i + 1]]

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version ensures that the dtype conversions during aggregation operations are handled correctly to avoid the TypeError related to casting from 'float64' to 'int64'.
