## Analysis:
1. The error message indicates that there is a TypeError occurring due to a failed cast from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') with 'safe' casting rule.
2. The issue reported on GitHub also points out a similar problem when calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype.
3. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is responsible for handling the aggregation of blocks and casting their values. The error occurs during the attempt to downcast the result to the original dtype, leading to the failed cast.
4. The buggy function tries to cast data values of dtype float64 to int64 through the `maybe_downcast_numeric` function, causing the TypeError.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the attempt to cast float64 values to int64 using the 'safe' casting rule, which fails because float64 values cannot be safely cast to int64.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the downcasting of values more carefully, avoiding casting float values to int in a way that might lose precision.

## Bug Fix for the provided function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # Actual managing of mgr_locs should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Default to Python aggregation mode when NotImplementedError
            result = self.grouper._python_agg_general(
                block.values, alt=alt, min_count=min_count, is_numeric=numeric_only
            )

        agg_blocks.append(block.make_block(result))

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate([block.mgr_locs.as_array for block in data.blocks])
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By handling the casting issue with a safer approach and performing the aggregation correctly, the fixed function should now be able to aggregate blocks without causing the TypeError during cast operations.
