The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is causing it to fail the test cases. The bug appears to be related to how the function handles the result of aggregation for some specific cases leading to unexpected outcomes. To fix this bug, we need to carefully review the implementation of the function in the context of the failing test cases. The function should properly aggregate the data based on the specified aggregation method and handle different data types appropriately.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.select_dtypes(include=[np.number])

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    # Some object-dtype blocks might be split into List[Block[T], Block[U]]
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            obj = self.obj.iloc[block.applymap(lambda x: not pd.isna(x)).any(axis=1).tolist()]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(alt)
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            result = cast(DataFrame, result)
            if len(result.columns) > 1:
                result = result.unstack()
        
        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result)

            agg_block: Block = make_block(result, placement=block.mgr_locs)
            new_items.append(agg_block.mgr_locs.as_array)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.argsort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        indexer = indexer[~np.isin(indexer, deleted)]
    
    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = BlockPlacement(indexer[offset : offset + loc])
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version of the function includes handling different aggregation cases based on the input parameters, properly creating the aggregated blocks, and considering the specific data structures and types involved in the aggregation process.

The function should now pass the failing test cases and produce the expected output for each case.
