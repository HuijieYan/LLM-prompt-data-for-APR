The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is not correctly handling operations with non-numeric data, resulting in failing tests. Based on the provided information, the issue seems to occur when aggregating non-numeric data for functions like `'mean'`, `'median'`, and `'var'`.

To fix this issue, the buggy function needs to be modified to handle non-numeric data properly. We should ensure that when non-numeric data is encountered, the function falls back to an alternative method to perform the aggregation.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()

    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                raise NotImplementedError("Cannot perform aggregation on non-numeric data")
            
            # Call the alternative function on this block
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
        
        assert not isinstance(result, DataFrame)

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result)
            agg_block: Block = make_block(result, placement=block.mgr_locs)
            new_items.append(np.array([agg_block.mgr_locs[0]], dtype=locs.dtype))
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    # Update the mgr_locs for each block
    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = BlockPlacement(slice(offset, offset + loc))
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version:
- We handle the case where alternative aggregation methods need to be applied to non-numeric data blocks.
- We convert the result to a proper format before creating the aggregation block.
- We adjust the placement of the new aggregation blocks based on the original data.

This corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing tests. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
