### Bug analysis
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` in the class `DataFrameGroupBy` is supposed to aggregate data based on certain criteria, but it fails to correctly handle object-dtype blocks that are split into multiple blocks. This leads to issues in processing the data and generating the correct output.

The key issue arises when an object-dtype block is split into multiple blocks, resulting in invalid assumptions about the shape and structure of the data. This incorrect assumption cascades through the aggregation process, leading to errors in the final result.

### Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, we need to properly handle the case where object-dtype blocks are split into multiple blocks. This involves adjusting the logic for processing these split blocks and ensuring that the data aggregation process handles these cases correctly.

### Updated and Corrected Function
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Handle case of non-numeric data or unsupported operation
            if alt is None:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            
            try:
                result = block.apply(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            
        # Handle split object-dtype blocks
        if result.ndim == 1:
            result = result.reshape(1, -1)
            
        # downcast result
        result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Adjust indexer for deleted items
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    # Update block locs based on the new ordering
    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = BlockPlacement(indexer[offset : offset + loc])
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

With the updated implementation, we handle the split blocks correctly and ensure that the data aggregation process maintains the integrity of the data structure. Testing this corrected function with the provided failing test cases should verify its effectiveness in resolving the bug.
