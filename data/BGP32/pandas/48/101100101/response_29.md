The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` has an issue where it incorrectly handles the case when an exception is raised during aggregation. This results in the creation of an invalid `agg_block` and incorrect handling of split blocks.

The bug arises from the part of the code where an exception is caught during aggregation and an alternate path is taken to calculate the aggregate. The code fails to properly handle the result after calculating the aggregate, leading to inconsistencies in the final output.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the result of the alternate aggregation path is properly transformed into the expected array format and inserted into the `agg_blocks` list. Additionally, we should handle split blocks more accurately to maintain consistency in the output.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))

        # Handle alternate aggregation result
        if not isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result)
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
        else:
            # Handle split blocks
            for i in range(result.shape[1]):
                vals = result.iloc[:, i]
                agg_block = make_block(vals.values, placement=slice(0, vals.shape[0], 1))
                new_items.append(np.array([locs[i]], dtype=locs.dtype))
                agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset block locs
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = BlockPlacement(slice(0, loc, 1))
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version ensures proper handling of exceptions during aggregation and accurately processes split blocks to generate the correct output. The function should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected results for each scenario.
