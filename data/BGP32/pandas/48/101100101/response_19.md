The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is encountering an issue where the `agg_block` is not created correctly, resulting in a failure to aggregate and return the expected values. To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `agg_block` is correctly created based on the `result` obtained from aggregation.

One key observation is that the `agg_block` needs to be created correctly with the aggregated `result`. This involves properly handling data types, reshaping arrays if necessary, and casting the block back to the original dtype.

To resolve the bug, the `agg_block` creation logic needs to be adjusted to handle different scenarios for processing the aggregated result. This includes checking the dtype, reshaping if needed, and handling ExtensionBlocks appropriately.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array

        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Handle non-applicable functions
            if alt is not None:
                obj = self.obj[block.items[0]]
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                if result.ndim == 1:
                    # Reshape to have 2 dimensions
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)
                try:
                    # Cast back to original dtype
                    result = block.dtype.construct_array_type()(
                        result.ravel(), dtype=block.dtype
                    )
                except ValueError:
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : offset + loc]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version, we have refined the creation of the `agg_block` by properly handling different scenarios for data types, reshaping arrays, and casting back to the original dtype. This should help resolve the bug and ensure that the function returns the expected values for the provided test cases.
