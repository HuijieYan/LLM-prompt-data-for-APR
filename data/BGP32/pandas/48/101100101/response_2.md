The buggy function is failing to handle the aggregation operation when certain conditions are met, resulting in incorrect output. The bug stems from issues related to how the result is computed and stored.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the result is properly aggregated and stored in the `agg_block`, `agg_items`, and `new_items` variables. We also need to handle the corner cases where exceptions occur during aggregation.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                # we cannot perform the operation in an alternate way, exclude the block
                deleted_items = locs
                continue
                
            try:
                result = block.agg(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                # exception in trying to aggregate, exclude the block
                deleted_items = locs
                continue

        result = maybe_convert_objects(result)
        agg_block: Block = make_block(result)

        new_items.append(result.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : offset + loc]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version addresses the issues with aggregation handling and ensures that the function behaves correctly under different conditions.

By updating the aggregation logic and handling exceptions properly, the function should now pass the failing test cases and produce the expected output values.
