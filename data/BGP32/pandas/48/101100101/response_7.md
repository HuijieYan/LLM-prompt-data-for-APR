The buggy function is failing due to incorrect handling of the data aggregation process within the `_cython_agg_blocks` method of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class.

The cause of the bug is related to the incorrect aggregation of data blocks within the loop, resulting in unexpected behavior during the process.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the aggregation process is correctly handled for each block of data. Additionally, the logic for handling different block types and aggregation results needs to be adjusted to align with the expected behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` method:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj.iloc[locs]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.argsort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = BlockPlacement(slice(offset, offset + loc, 1))
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version focuses on proper data aggregation and handling of different block types to ensure correct outcomes for each data block.

Please use this corrected version in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class to fix the bug.
