The issue with the `_cython_agg_blocks` function lies in how it handles the result calculation and manipulation. The code is not correctly aggregating the data and is missing some necessary conversions leading to incorrect results. The code block responsible for creating the final result is flawed and does not consider all possible cases.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the aggregation process handles all data types correctly, applies the aggregation function appropriately, and prepares the final result in the expected format.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
from pandas.core.indexes import base
from pandas.core.indexes.multi import MultiIndex

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

        if result is None:
            continue

        result = maybe_convert_objects(result)

        agg_block = make_block(result, placement=block.mgr_locs)

        new_items.append(np.array([b for b in block.mgr_locs], dtype=block.mgr_locs.dtype))
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset:offset + loc]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version handles the aggregation process for varying data types, correctly aggregates the data according to the specified function, and prepares the final result in the expected format.

Make sure to replace the buggy `_cython_agg_blocks` function in the `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` file with this corrected version.

After applying this fix, the `test_apply_to_nullable_integer_returns_float` test cases should pass as expected.
