The buggy function is not correctly aggregating data and constructing blocks leading to incorrect results during execution. The main issue lies in the logic for handling results and blocks within the loop.

The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is as follows:
1. Ensure that the correct values are obtained from the groupby object and the data to aggregate.
2. Update the logic inside the for loop to handle aggregation results and construct blocks appropriately.
3. Make sure that the indices and locs are correctly updated for the aggregated blocks.
4. Handle cases where blocks may need to be split or reshaped.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

        agg_block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.argsort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = BlockPlacement(indexer[offset : offset + loc])
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version should handle the aggregation and block construction correctly, ensuring that the function is now implemented according to the expected logic.
