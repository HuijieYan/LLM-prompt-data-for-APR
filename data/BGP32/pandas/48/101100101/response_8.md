The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` has several issues that need to be addressed. Here is a summary of the identified problems and a strategy to fix them:

### Bugs:
1. The function is supposed to aggregate data but has a complex structure involving multiple loops and exceptions.
2. The function uses outdated internal attributes from Pandas.
3. The error handling is not clearly defined and may lead to unexpected behavior.
4. Some variable types and states are inconsistent.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Simplify the function by refactoring it to handle the aggregation more efficiently.
2. Update the references to internal Pandas attributes to avoid using deprecated methods.
3. Improve error handling by providing clear exceptions and proper flow control.
4. Ensure that variable types and states are consistent throughout the function.

### Revised Function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.select_dtypes(include=[np.number])

    agg_blocks = []
    new_items = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        try:
            result = block.agg(how, min_count=min_count)
        except TypeError:
            # Fallback to alternate method if provided
            if alt is not None:
                result = block.agg(alt)
            else:
                raise NotImplementedError("Aggregation method not implemented")
        
        result = maybe_convert_objects(result)

        agg_block = make_block(
            result.values, placement=block.mgr_locs, klass=Block, ndim=2
        )
        
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs)

    # Combine aggregated blocks into final BlockManager
    agg_items = data.items
    agg_blocks = _merge_blocks(agg_blocks, dtype=np.float64)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By following this strategy, we have simplified the function, updated the internal references, and improved error handling. This revised version should pass the failing test cases and produce the expected results.
