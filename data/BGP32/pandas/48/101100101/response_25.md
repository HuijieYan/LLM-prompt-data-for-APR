The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function seems to be related to the incorrect handling of the columns when aggregating the data. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly aggregates the data and constructs the resulting blocks according to the expected output.
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function _cython_agg_blocks
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.select_dtypes(include=[np.number])

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Handle cases where an alternative aggregation method is needed
            if alt is None:
                deleted_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[block.mgr_locs.items]
            result = obj.groupby(self.grouper.index).transform(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            result = result.squeeze() if result.ndim == 2 else result
        else:
            if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
                result = result.to_numpy()

        result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
        agg_block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # Construct the final aggregated data
    # (not considering split objects for now)

    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    # Adjust the indexer to account for any deleted items
    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = BlockPlacement(slice(offset, offset + loc, 1))
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version of the function includes the following improvements:
1. Selecting only numeric columns if `numeric_only` is set to `True`.
2. Properly handling the aggregation of data and handling alternative aggregation methods.
3. Constructing the final aggregated data according to the expected output.
4. Adjusting the locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering.

By applying these corrections, the function should now correctly aggregate the data and construct the output blocks as expected.
