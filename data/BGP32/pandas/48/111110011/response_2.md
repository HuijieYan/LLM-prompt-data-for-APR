### Bug Analysis:
1. The error occurs when calling `mean`, `median`, or `var` on a DataFrameGroupBy object with nullable integer type.
2. The error message shows a TypeError when trying to cast from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') according to the rule 'safe'.
3. The issue on GitHub highlights the problem with calling `mean` on DataFrameGroupBy with `Int64` dtype.
4. The error is related to the handling of nullable integer types when performing aggregation operations.

### Bug Explanation:
- The bug arises in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function where the aggregation process is done on blocks of data.
- When the DataFrame has nullable integer data and an aggregation operation like `mean`, `median`, or `var` is performed, the function fails to handle the casting from floating-point to integer correctly.
- This leads to the `TypeError` showing that it cannot cast from float64 to int64 safely.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug and resolve the TypeError, we need to ensure the proper casting when dealing with nullable integer data during aggregation operations. 
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        # Perform aggregation while handling nullable ints correctly
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )
        
        if result is None:
            continue
        
        # Cast the result back to the original dtype
        result = maybe_convert_objects(result, deep=True)

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
    
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By correctly converting objects and handling nullable integers during aggregation, the fixed function should now handle the `mean`, `median`, `var`, and other aggregation operations on nullable integer data without raising the TypeError.

This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug where calling `mean` on a DataFrameGroupBy with `Int64` dtype resulted in a TypeError.
