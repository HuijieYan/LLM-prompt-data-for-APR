### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is used within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the pandas library to handle aggregation operations.
2. The error message indicates a problem with safely casting values from float64 to int64, leading to a `TypeError`.
3. The issue on GitHub describes a scenario where calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype results in a `TypeError`.
4. The bug arises when trying to handle casting of values, mainly related to nullable integer data types.
5. The bug appears to be related to handling the different data types and casting between them during aggregation.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs during aggregation operations when trying to cast float64 values to int64 in certain scenarios, particularly with nullable integer data types. The `_cython_agg_blocks` function fails to properly handle the casting operation, leading to a `TypeError`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the casting operation from float64 to int64 is handled correctly, especially when dealing with nullable integer data types. We can introduce additional checks and conversions to ensure proper data type handling during aggregation operations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        
        # Convert result to intended dtype based on block type
        result = maybe_convert_objects(result, block, copy=False)
        result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
        
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[:loc]
        indexer = indexer[loc:]

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that the result of the aggregation operation is properly converted to the intended data type based on the block type. By adding the `maybe_convert_objects` and `maybe_downcast_numeric` functions, we handle the data type conversion correctly, resolving the casting issue.
