### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` file is causing a TypeError when calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with an `Int64` dtype.
2. The bug occurs due to casting from `float64` to `int64`.
3. The function `_cython_agg_blocks` is used for aggregating grouped data blocks, and there seems to be an issue with the casting of the values.
4. The test case is failing due to this casting error, resulting in a `TypeError`.
5. The GitHub issue provides more context to the bug, showcasing the specific scenario where the error occurs.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug:
1. Update the casting logic to handle dtype conversion from `float64` to `int64` or to ensure that the appropriate dtype is maintained throughout the aggregation process.
2. Ensure that the casting operation, particularly in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, handles the nullable integer types correctly when dealing with means or medians.

### Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    # Corrected handling of numeric only and dtype casting
    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array

        # Check if the block dtype is Int64 and adjust casting
        if block.dtype == 'Int64':
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values.astype('float'), how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )

            result = result.astype('Int64')  # Ensure correct dtype after aggregation
        else:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By modifying the dtype conversion logic for nullable integers and ensuring that the correct dtype is maintained during aggregation, we can resolve the TypeError when calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with an `Int64` dtype.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
