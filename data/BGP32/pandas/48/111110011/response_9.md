### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is called by the `mean`, `median`, and `var` methods in the failing test.
- The error message indicates a problem with casting non-equivalent `float64` dtype to `int64`.
- The issue on GitHub also describes a similar problem when calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype.

### Bug explanation:
The bug is likely related to the conversion of float values to integer values which are of different data types. Operations like mean, median, and var may involve calculations that result in floating-point values which cannot be directly converted to integer values without additional checks.

### Fix strategy:
- Ensure that operations dealing with numeric values that may result in float values handle the conversion to integer values appropriately.
- Check if the output dtype of the operation is consistent with the expected dtype (int64 in this case).

### Updated Bug-fixed Code:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # Code to handle aggregating blocks, focusing on pending issues below.
    
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    # Removed deleted_items and split_items initialization
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []
    
    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Existing code to handle aggregation per block
        
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )
        
        # Check dtype and handle accordingly, avoiding direct conversion
        if result.dtype == np.float64:
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result)
        
        # Ensure downcasting and proper dtype handling
        result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
        result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, block.dtype)
        
        # Create a new Block with the result
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # Rest of the function remains mostly the same

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

### Explanation:
- The updated code focuses on handling the values to avoid direct conversion from float to integer if they are not equivalent.
- It includes checks for the dtype of the result before handling casting or downcasting appropriately.
- The function is modified to ensure the output dtype consistency and proper conversion if needed.
