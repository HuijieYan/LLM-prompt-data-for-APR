### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the `pandas.core.groupby.generic` module.
2. The error message indicates a `TypeError` related to casting from `float64` to `int64`.
3. The failing test case is attempting to calculate the mean, median, or variance on data grouped by a column with nullable integer types (`Int64`).
4. The bug is caused by the failing conversion from floats to integers in a particular section of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.
5. The GitHub issue provided more context around the bug, indicating that the issue appears when calling `mean`, `median`, or `var` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` dtype.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The bug in `_cython_agg_blocks` arises when trying to safely cast non-equivalent float64 values to int64.
2. The issue occurs due to the conversion error during the aggregation process, which fails when trying to cast float values to integer values.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the cast from float64 to int64 happens correctly, especially for nullable integer types.
2. We should handle the conversion correctly to avoid the TypeError related to casting in the aggregation process.

### Corrected Function:

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        # Handle the case where the data type is float and needs to be converted to int
        if block.values.dtype.name == 'float64' and block.values.ndim == 1:
            result = block.values.astype('int64')
        else:
            result = block.values

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    return agg_blocks, data.items
```  

This modification ensures that the conversion from float64 to int64 is handled correctly for the specific case encountered in the failing test.

By updating the `_cython_agg_blocks` function as shown, the bug should be fixed, and the failing test case should pass successfully.
