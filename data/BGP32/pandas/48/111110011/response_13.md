### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class, which extends `GroupBy` class.
2. The error message indicates a `TypeError` related to casting from float64 to int64, impacting the `mean` and `var` functions.
3. The issue reported on GitHub highlights a similar problem with calling `mean` on a grouped DataFrame with `Int64` dtype.
4. The error occurs when trying to cast non-equivalent float64 to int64.
5. The bug seems to originate from the attempt to cast float64 values to int64.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the mismatch in the data type expected by the function compared to the actual data type encountered.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, the float values should be appropriately handled to avoid casting them to int64 directly, which causes the `TypeError`. By ensuring consistent handling of data types, the bug can be resolved.

### Corrected Version of `_cython_agg_blocks` function:
```python
    def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
        for block in data.blocks:
            locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
            try:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
            except NotImplementedError:
                alt_func = alt if alt is not None else (lambda x: x)
                result = block.apply(alt_func, axis=1)
                result = maybe_convert_objects(result)
    
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result, placement=block.mgr_locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
    
        if not agg_blocks:
            raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
    
        indexer = np.concatenate([b.mgr_locs for b in agg_blocks])
        agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)
    
        return agg_blocks, agg_items
``` 

With this corrected version, the function should handle float64 values appropriately and avoid the casting issues, thus resolving the reported bug.
