### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class of pandas is causing a TypeError when calling mean, median, or var on a DataFrameGroupBy object with values of nullable integer type (`Int64`).
2. The error message indicates a problem with casting from float64 to int64, which suggests an issue with the data type conversion.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the exact problem with calling mean on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` dtype.
4. The cause of the bug lies in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function and its handling of data types during aggregation.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when `_cython_agg_blocks` function tries to cast `float64` values to `int64` during aggregation in scenarios with `numeric_only=True`. This type conversion leads to a TypeError as it attempts to convert incompatible types resulting in a failure to calculate the mean, median, or var.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. When working with nullable integer data types, ensure that the type conversion and casting are compatible.
2. Use the appropriate type conversion methods to handle the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) properly.
3. Implement a check to handle the potential conversion issues between float64 and int64 for the mean, median, var calculations.
4. Update the code in `_cython_agg_blocks` to properly handle nullable integer type conversion.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        except NotImplementedError:
            raise DataError(f"Function '{how}' not supported for nullable integer data type") from None

        if not isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
            raise DataError("Aggregation result must be a numpy array")

        result = maybe_convert_objects(result)
        agg_blocks.append(block.make_block(result))
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By implementing the above changes, the function should now handle nullable integer types correctly and avoid the TypeError that was occurring previously.
