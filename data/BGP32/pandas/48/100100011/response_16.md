### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is responsible for aggregating blocks in a GroupBy object. 
2. The issue reported on GitHub involves calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy with an `Int64` dtype, which results in a TypeError. This bug is likely related to the implementation of aggregation in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.
3. The bug might be related to incorrect handling of nullable integer data type (`Int64`) during aggregation, leading to type errors.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_cython_agg_blocks` function correctly handles the nullable integer data type and other data types during aggregation.

### Bug Fix:
The buggy code can be fixed by updating the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle nullable integer data type (`Int64`) correctly during aggregation. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Handle alternate aggregation for non-numeric data types
            if alt is None:
                raise NotImplementedError("Alternate aggregation method not provided")
            
            obj = self.obj[block.mgr_locs]
            result = obj.agg(alt)
        
        # Handle Nullable integer type
        result = maybe_convert_objects(result, prefer_chain=False)
        result = cast(np.ndarray, np.atleast_2d(result))  # Convert to 2D array

        agg_block: Block = make_block(result, block.items, block.ref_items)

        new_items.append(agg_block.mgr_locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No types to aggregate")

    # Update block locs based on new ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)
    
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version includes handling of nullable integers by converting the result to handle nullable integer type data properly.

After applying this fix and testing, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should now correctly handle nullable integer data type and fix the TypeError issue reported on GitHub.
