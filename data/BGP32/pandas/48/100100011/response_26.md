### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is causing an issue when calling `mean` on a DataFrameGroupBy object with Int64 dtype, resulting in a TypeError.
- The issue mentioned in the GitHub problem description matches the behavior of the buggy function.
- The bug seems to be related to handling numeric data types within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

### Bug:
- The bug seems to be related to how the function is handling the data types when performing aggregation operations, especially with nullable integer types.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure proper handling of nullable integer types during aggregation operations.
2. Check for type compatibility before performing operations.
3. Handle exceptions or unsupported cases gracefully.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.select_dtypes(include=np.number, exclude=[np.object_])

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except (NotImplementedError, TypeError):
            # Handle exceptions gracefully
            deleted_items.append(locs)
            continue

        if result is no_result:
            continue

        # Handling nullable integer types
        if pd.Int64Dtype.is_dtype(block.dtype):
            # Convert the result to float if it's not an object dtype
            if not isinstance(result, np.ndarray) or result.dtype != np.object_:
                result = result.astype(float)

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version includes modifications to handle nullable integer types properly during aggregation, ensuring type compatibility and graceful error handling.

### Note:
- Make sure to test the corrected function against the failing test case to confirm that the bug has been fixed successfully.
