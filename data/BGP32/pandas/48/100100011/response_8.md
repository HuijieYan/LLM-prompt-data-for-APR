### Bug Analysis:
1. The `_cython_agg_blocks` function is responsible for performing aggregation operations on blocks.
2. The bug may be related to handling nullable integer data types (`Int64`) during aggregation, as reported in the GitHub issue.
3. The bug results in a TypeError when calling certain aggregation functions like mean, median, and var after grouping with nullable integer data.
4. The bug seems to be related to how the function processes the data blocks during aggregation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check for any issues related to handling nullable integer data types (`Int64`) during aggregation.
2. Ensure that the function can handle aggregation operations on nullable integer data types correctly.
3. Update the function to handle nullable integer data types appropriately and avoid the TypeError reported in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix - Corrected Function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        # Ensuring the result is cast back to original dtype
        result = maybe_convert_objects(result, convert_datetime=True)

        # Directly create agg_block without type casting
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By using `maybe_convert_objects` to ensure correct type casting of the result and handling nullable integer data types appropriately, the corrected function should now be able to handle aggregation operations on nullable integer data types without causing a TypeError.
