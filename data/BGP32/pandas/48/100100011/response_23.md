### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs when calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` dtype. The issue is related to the `_cython_agg_blocks` method in the `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` file, which is responsible for handling aggregation operations.

### Error Location:
The error seems to stem from the way the function is handling the dtype conversion during aggregation, particularly when dealing with the `Int64` dtype. The bug causes a `TypeError` to be raised when calling mean after grouping.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of dtype conversions within the `_cython_agg_blocks` method, especially when dealing with nullable integer types like `Int64`. This incorrect handling leads to the `TypeError` when trying to compute the mean.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the dtype conversion logic within the `_cython_agg_blocks` method is correctly handling nullable integer types. This should involve proper checks and conversions to prevent the `TypeError` during aggregation operations.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Include handling for alternate aggregation methods if needed
            if alt is None:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]].iloc[:, 0]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

        if not isinstance(result, pd.DataFrame):
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result, try_float=False, convert_string=False)
            agg_block = make_block(result, loc=locs)

            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No data to aggregate")

    agg_items = data.items.take(np.concatenate(new_items))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

Make sure to test the corrected function with the failing test to verify if the issue has been resolved.
