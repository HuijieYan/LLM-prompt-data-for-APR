### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is related to aggregating data in a groupby operation.
2. The function seems to have issues with handling blocks and aggregating them based on the specified criteria.
3. The GitHub issue indicates a problem with calling `mean` on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype, resulting in a TypeError.
4. The bug seems to be related to handling nullable integer data types during aggregation operations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the function `_cython_agg_blocks` not properly handling nullable integer data types during aggregation, leading to a TypeError when calling `mean` on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function `_cython_agg_blocks` properly handles nullable integer data types during aggregation operations. This involves ensuring proper conversion or handling of nullable integer data to avoid any TypeErrors during aggregation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

        if result is not None:
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result)
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : offset + loc]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version should properly handle nullable integer data types during aggregation in a groupby operation, resolving the TypeError mentioned in the GitHub issue.
