### Analysis
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is encountering TypeErrors related to casting array values from `float64` to `int64` in functions like `mean`, `median`, or `var` during the aggregation process. The safe cast checks are failing due to the "non-equivalent" comparison between the float values to integer types.

### Bug Fixing Strategy
To resolve the TypeErrors related to the failed casting, we need to ensure that the values from `float64` are properly converted to `int64` when the aggregation operation `mean`, `median`, or `var` encounters them within the `cython_agg_blocks` function.

### Bug Fix
Below is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function that addresses the TypeErrors mentioned in the failing tests:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # The main logic of the function remains the same
    # Existing code...
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs].to_numpy()]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            else:
                result = result.applymap(lambda x: int(x) if np.isnan(x) == False else np.nan)
                
        # Remaining code unchanged...
```

### Explanation
In the bug fix, the key change is in the `else` block after the inner `try`. Here, we added an `applymap` function to convert float values to integers (`int`) only if the value is not `np.nan`. This fix ensures that floating-point values are properly converted to integers (`int64`) where applicable before aggregation.

By applying this fix, the TypeErrors arising from incorrect casting from `float64` to `int64` should be resolved, and the corrected version should pass the failing tests.
