### Analysis:
1. The function `_cython_agg_blocks` is trying to aggregate blocks of data from a BlockManager based on certain conditions and transformations.
2. The error is occurring when trying to perform a cast from float64 to int64 using `maybe_downcast_numeric` function.
3. The error message specifically points to the inability to safely cast non-equivalent float64 to int64.
4. The issue could be due to inconsistent data types or unexpected values during the aggregation process.
5. The error arises in situations where the rules for casting between float64 and int64 in `astype` are not met.

### Strategy:
1. Modify the function to handle the float64 to int64 conversion issue by checking for compatibility.
2. Perform additional checks to ensure that the data being aggregated is consistent in type and values.
3. Catch the specific TypeError and handle it appropriately by adjusting the cast or treating the data differently.

### Correction:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            ...

        ...

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            if not (isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and np.issubdtype(result.dtype, np.integer)):
                # Handle cast only for integer values
                result = result.astype(block.dtype)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    ...

    return agg_blocks, data.items.take(np.sort(np.concatenate(new_items)))
``` 

In the corrected version, we added a check to verify that the result values being cast are integers before performing the downcast, avoiding the TypeError related to casting float to int. Additionally, we adjusted the aggregation and indexing logic to ensure correct processing.
