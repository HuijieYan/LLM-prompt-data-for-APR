### Analysis:
- The error message indicates a type error: `TypeError: Cannot cast array from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64')`.
- The bug seems to be related to the handling of casting values from float64 to int64 within the provided `_cython_agg_blocks` function.
- The code attempts to cast the values using `values.astype(dtype, casting="safe", copy=copy)`, but encounters a type error when trying to convert from floating point to integer.

### Bug Location:
The bug seems to occur around the following part of the code:
```python
# see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
```

### Bug Cause:
The type error is triggered when trying to cast the `result` values back to the original block's dtype. The code does not handle the conversion from float64 to int64 correctly based on the given inputs.

### Suggested Fix:
To address the bug, modify the block of code responsible for casting the `result` values back to the original dtype in order to correctly convert from float64 to int64.

### Corrected Version:
Here's an updated version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function with the bug fixed:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            # Apply aggregation to the block's values
            result = alt(block.values, axis=self.axis)

        assert not isinstance(result, DataFrame)

        if result is not no_result:
            # Safely cast the block to the original dtype
            result = maybe_cast_to_int(result).astype(block.dtype)

            # Create the aggregator block
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)

            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # ... Remaining logic to adjust indexing and return values

    return agg_blocks, agg_items

def maybe_cast_to_int(result: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Safely cast the result values to int64 if conversion from float64 is necessary.
    """
    if result.dtype == "float64":
        # Conditionally cast from float64 to int64
        int_results = np.around(result).astype("Int64")
        if np.allclose(int_results, result):
            return int_results
    return result
```

This correction should address the type conversion issue and allow for the function to correctly handle cases where floating-point values need to be safely cast to integer values.

Please test this corrected version to ensure that it resolves the type casting problem.
