### Analysis:
The error occurs when trying to cast an array from `float64` to `int64` according to the rule 'safe'. The problem arises when the function `safe_cast` is called to cast values correctly, but due to non-equivalent data types, a `TypeError` is raised.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises when attempting to downcast float values to integer values. In the case of the failing tests, the float values are not equivalent to the integer values they are cast to, which leads to the `TypeError` being raised during the casting.

### Strategy for Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the cases where non-equivalent data types are being cast. One approach is to change how the values are cast, ensuring that equivalent types or compatible types are cast accurately.

### Bug Fix:
Below is the modified version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function that correctly handles the casting of values to avoid the `TypeError` for non-equivalent types.

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

        if result is not None:
            # performing type compatible cast
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result, block.values)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No data to aggregate")

    # Updating indices and blocks
    new_concat, dist_sizes = np.unique(np.concatenate(new_items), return_counts=True)
    new_locs = np.cumsum(dist_sizes)

    if deleted_items:
        # Exclude removed items
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        delete_locs = np.searchsorted(new_concat, deleted)
        new_locs = new_locs - np.searchsorted(delete_locs, new_locs)

    offset = 0
    for blk, locs in zip(agg_blocks, new_locs):
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = new_concat[offset : offset + loc]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, data.items.take(new_concat)
```

In this corrected version, casting is performed using `maybe_convert_objects` which handles the conversion appropriately for non-equivalent data types when possible. This updated handling should prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when casting values during aggregation.
