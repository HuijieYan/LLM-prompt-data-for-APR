### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the `pandas` library.
2. The function is responsible for aggregating data blocks based on specified criteria.
3. The bug likely causing the function to fail could be related to incorrect handling of data types during aggregation.
4. The failing test `test_apply_to_nullable_integer_returns_float` tests the aggregation function using various statistical functions like mean, median, and variance.
5. The bug may be related to data type conversion errors or incorrect handling of non-numeric data during aggregation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that data type conversions during aggregation are handled correctly.
2. Check for any edge cases related to non-numeric data handling.
3. Verify that the aggregation process is consistent and accurate for different statistical functions.

### Corrected Version of `_cython_agg_blocks` function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except BaseException:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))

        result = maybe_convert_objects(result)
        result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, dtype=np.float_)
        
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    return agg_blocks, data.items
```

### Correction Rationale:
1. After aggregating each block, the corrected version ensures to convert the result to a float type using `maybe_convert_objects` and `maybe_downcast_to_dtype` to avoid data type discrepancies.
2. The correction aims to maintain consistency in data types during aggregation and handle non-numeric data appropriately.
3. The bug fix focuses on resolving potential issues related to data type handling in the aggregation process.
