To fix the bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, we need to address the issue of splitting object-dtype blocks into `List[Block[T], Block[U]]`. This issue arises when trying to aggregate non-numeric data with a function that is not supported, causing the block to be split into two separate blocks, which leads to incorrect aggregation.

We can fix this bug by modifying the logic in the block processing section of the function to handle the case where a block is split into multiple blocks. Instead of immediately appending the blocks to `agg_blocks`, we need to handle cases where a block is split, combine the split blocks, and adjust the indexing accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

        if isinstance(result, tuple):
            # If the block was split into multiple blocks
            result = np.concatenate(result)
            assert len(result) == len(block.mgr_locs)

        # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
        result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

        agg_block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))
    
    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This correction ensures that the function can handle cases where blocks are split due to the nature of the data, and it correctly combines the split blocks before returning the aggregated result.
