## Analysis
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in pandas.core.groupby.generic.py is supposed to perform aggregation operations on blocks of data within a DataFrameGroupBy object. However, the function contains errors that cause it to fail when used in certain scenarios, as indicated by the provided failing test.

## Bugs Identified
1. In the `except NotImplementedError` block, the condition `if alt is None:` is checking if the `alt` argument is None. If this condition is true, the assertion `assert how == "ohlc"` will raise an AssertionError. This could be a source of failure if the condition is met and `how` is not equal to "ohlc".
2. The commented out section `# we cannot perform the operation...` indicates that the block should be excluded, but it does not handle this exclusion properly.
3. There is a possibility of an exception in the `except TypeError` block due to incorrectly handling the aggregation operation.
4. The implementation related to handling split object-dtype blocks in the `else:` block after `try-except` is incomplete and potentially incorrect.
5. The check `if isinstance(result, DataFrame):` is done after the `except` block, which may lead to unexpected behavior.
6. The `if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):` block might not be properly handling the case where `block.values` is an IntegerArray.

## Proposed Fix Strategy
1. Correct the conditional check in the `except NotImplementedError` block to handle the case where `alt` is None without assuming `how == "ohlc"`.
2. Properly exclude the block when the condition in the `except NotImplementedError` block is met by skipping the rest of the loop if necessary.
3. Ensure that exceptions in the `except TypeError` block are properly handled or escalated to prevent silent failures.
4. Improve the handling of split object-dtype blocks to correctly process the result and aggregation.
5. Move the check for `isinstance(result, DataFrame)` to an appropriate location for better control flow.
6. Address the potential issues with handling `block.is_extension` and `result` being an ndarray properly.

## Corrected Version of the Function
Below is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function after addressing the identified issues:

```python
# Corrected version of the _cython_agg_blocks function
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        else:
            if len(result._data.blocks) != 1:
                split_items.append(locs)
                split_frames.append(result)
                continue
            result = result._data.blocks[0].values
            if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
                result = result.reshape(1, -1)

            if not isinstance(result, DataFrame):
                result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
                if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                    try:
                        result = type(block.values)._from_sequence(
                            result.ravel(), dtype=block.values.dtype
                        )
                    except ValueError:
                        result = result.reshape(1, -1)
                agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
                new_items.append(locs)
                agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    if split_items:
        for locs, result in zip(split_items, split_frames):
            for i, loc in enumerate(locs):
                new_items.append(np.array([loc], dtype=locs.dtype))
                agg_blocks.append(result.iloc[:, [i]]._data.blocks[0])

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By implementing these corrections, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should now handle the aggregation of blocks within a DataFrameGroupBy object correctly and pass the failing tests provided.
