### Analysis:
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class of the `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` file is causing failures in the test cases provided. The error is likely due to improper handling of different data types and numeric operations within the function.

### Identified Issue:
The main issue seems to be related to the aggregation of data blocks, especially when dealing with non-numeric data or different data types. The function is failing to handle certain cases where the aggregation result is not in the expected format, leading to errors during processing.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by inconsistent handling of aggregation results, especially when dealing with object-dtype blocks or split blocks that do not conform to the expected structure. This inconsistency in handling different types of blocks and their aggregation results is resulting in the failures.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles the aggregation results for different types of blocks, including object-dtype blocks and split blocks. Proper checks and conversions should be made to ensure that the aggregation results are correctly processed and combined into the final output.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
                continue

            result = cast(DataFrame, block)
            result = result.apply(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))

        if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
            result = result.reshape(1, -1)

        new_block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(new_block)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    offset = 0
    for idx, blk in enumerate(agg_blocks):
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : offset + loc]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should properly handle different types of aggregation results and ensure correct processing and combination of blocks, addressing the bug causing failures in the test cases provided.
