### Analysis:
1. The function `_cython_agg_blocks` is responsible for aggregating blocks within the DataFrameGroupBy class.
2. The bug is likely related to the handling of different data types and the aggregation process within the function.
3. The failing tests indicate that the bug is causing incorrect aggregation results when specific functions like `mean`, `median`, and `var` are used.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the aggregation process is correctly handling different data types and functions.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of different data types during the aggregation process within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

### Bug Fix:
I will correct the function by modifying the way numerical data is handled during aggregation and ensuring that the aggregation results are appropriately returned.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.convert(numeric_only=True)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs

        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.agg(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            else:
                result = result.values

        if result is not no_result:
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
            new_items.append(locs)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version, I made adjustments to how numerical data is handled, ensuring that the aggregation process works correctly.
