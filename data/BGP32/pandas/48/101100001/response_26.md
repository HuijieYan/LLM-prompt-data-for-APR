### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class is responsible for aggregating data using Cython operations.
2. The bug seems to be related to handling object-dtype blocks that might be split into `List[Block[T], Block[U]]`.
3. The bug can cause errors when splitting object-dtype blocks and processing the data for aggregation.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper handling of object-dtype blocks that are split during aggregation.
5. The correction involves adjusting the logic for handling split blocks and cleaning up the mess left over from split blocks.

### Bug Fix:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            result = cast(DataFrame, result)
            
        if not isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or deleted_items):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.argsort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

With this correction, the bug related to handling object-dtype blocks during aggregation should be fixed, and the function should now work as intended and pass the provided failing test.
