After analyzing the buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks`, the issue seems to be related to handling split blocks and the aggregation process of data blocks. The error occurs when the code tries to handle split object-dtype blocks.

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of split object-dtype blocks when aggregating data, leading to errors in the aggregation process and incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the handling of split object-dtype blocks and ensure that the aggregation process is correctly applied to all types of blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

        if result is not None:  # Some blocks may not have been aggregated
            if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
                result = result.iloc[:, 0].values  # Extract values from DataFrame
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Update locs of aggregated blocks
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.argsort(indexer))

    # Update locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    for idx, blk in enumerate(agg_blocks):
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[idx]

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By making these changes, the corrected function should now handle the aggregation of split blocks properly and pass the failing test cases.
