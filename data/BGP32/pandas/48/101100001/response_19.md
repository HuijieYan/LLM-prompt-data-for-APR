### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is responsible for aggregating data based on certain conditions.
- The cause of the bug is likely related to how the `result` variable is handled within the loop, leading to incorrect aggregation.
- Additionally, there are conditions that are triggered when certain exceptions are raised during aggregation.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of the `result` variable within the loop.
- When certain exceptions are raised during aggregation, the `result` variable may not be correctly assigned or handled, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Fix Strategy:
- Ensure that the `result` variable is correctly handled and assigned within the loop.
- Make sure to address the conditions triggered by exceptions during aggregation to prevent unexpected behavior.

### Code Fix:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    no_result = object()
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            
            if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
                result = result._data.blocks[0].values
                if result.ndim == 1:
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)
        
        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                try:
                    result = type(block.values)._from_sequence(
                        result.ravel(), dtype=block.values.dtype
                    )
                except ValueError:
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Adjust the locs in the blocks
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

### The corrected version of the function should now handle the `result` variable correctly during aggregation and address exceptions appropriately.
