The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function arises from the incorrect use of the `DataFrame` class instead of the `Block` class, resulting in an assertion error due to incompatible types. To fix this bug, we need to correctly handle the aggregation process using the appropriate classes and methods.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
    def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
        # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine
    
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
        no_result = object()
        for block in data.blocks:
            # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
            result = no_result
            locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
            try:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
            except NotImplementedError:
                # generally if we have numeric_only=False
                # and non-applicable functions
                # try to python agg
    
                if alt is None:
                    # we cannot perform the operation
                    # in an alternate way, exclude the block
                    assert how == "ohlc"
                    deleted_items.append(locs)
                    continue
    
                # call our grouper again with only this block
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                try:
                    result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=1))
                except TypeError:
                    # we may have an exception in trying to aggregate
                    # continue and exclude the block
                    deleted_items.append(locs)
                    continue
                else:
                    result = cast(Block, result)
    
            if result is not no_result:
                agg_block: Block = make_block(result, placement=locs, klass=type(block))
                agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
                new_items.append(locs)
    
        if not agg_blocks:
            raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
    
        agg_items = data.items.take(np.concatenate(new_items))
    
        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By using the `make_block` function correctly and ensuring that the `result` is cast to a `Block` object, we can fix the bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases.
