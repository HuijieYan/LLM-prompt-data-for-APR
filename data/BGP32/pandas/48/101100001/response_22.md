### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` inside the `DataFrameGroupBy` class seems to have issues with handling splits in object-dtype blocks and managing the different cases appropriately.
2. The function is intended to aggregate data from blocks within the `BlockManager` based on the `how` parameter, but has issues with handling exceptions and split blocks.
3. The failing test cases highlight a scenario where the buggy function fails to handle some specific cases resulting in incorrect aggregation outputs.
4. To fix the bug, we need to review the logic inside the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to properly handle exceptions, split blocks, and ensure correct aggregation results.
5. Additionally, the function should be modified to handle different cases of input data to produce the expected output.

### Proposed Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is not None:
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                    obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]
                
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                
                try:
                    result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                except TypeError:
                    agg_blocks.append(block.reindex(locs))
                else:
                    result = cast(DataFrame, result)
                    result_block = block.make_block(result)
                    agg_blocks.append(result_block)
        else:
            result_block = block.make_block(result)
            agg_blocks.append(result_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
    
    new_items = np.concatenate([blk.mgr_locs.as_array for blk in agg_blocks])
    agg_items = data.items.take(new_items)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By implementing the corrected logic, the function should now handle the aggregation process correctly and pass the failing test cases.
