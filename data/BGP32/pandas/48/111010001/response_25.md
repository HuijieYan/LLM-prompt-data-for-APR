## Analysis
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class of the `pandas` package has issues with casting from float64 to int64. The error occurs due to the inability to safely cast non-equivalent float64 values to int64 according to the 'safe' rule during the `astype` operation.

## Bug
The main issue arises when trying to cast float64 values to int64 using `values.astype(dtype, casting="safe")`, where the rule 'safe' doesn't allow this conversion directly, causing a `TypeError`.

## Fix
To fix this bug, you can modify the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle the float64 to int64 casting more gracefully. One possible strategy is to handle this conversion explicitly in a safe manner. This could involve checking the dtype of the original values and converting them to the desired dtype if they are float64.

Here is a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function that addresses the casting issue:
```python
def safe_cast(values, dtype, copy: bool):
    """
    Safely cast the values to the dtype if they
    are equivalent, meaning floats must be equivalent to the
    ints.

    """
    try:
        return values.astype(dtype, casting="safe", copy=copy)
    except TypeError as err:
        if values.dtype == np.float64 and dtype == np.int64:
            return values.astype(np.int64)
        raise TypeError(
            f"cannot safely cast non-equivalent {values.dtype} to {np.dtype(dtype)}"
        ) from err

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # existing code

    for block in data.blocks:
        # existing code
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # existing code
        ...
        if result is not no_result:
            # existing code

            if result is not no_result:
                # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
                result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
                
                if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                    # e.g. block.values was an IntegerArray
                    # handle float64 to int64 casting explicitly
                    result = safe_cast(result, block.dtype, copy=False)

                agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # existing code

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version, the `safe_cast` function explicitly handles the case when converting float64 values to int64, and this function is called where needed in `_cython_agg_blocks`.

By addressing the casting issue directly, you should be able to resolve the TypeError related to non-equivalent cast during aggregation operations in the `pandas` package.
