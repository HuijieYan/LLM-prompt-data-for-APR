1. The function `_cython_agg_blocks` in class `DataFrameGroupBy` from the `pandas.core.groupby.generic.py` file seems to be related to an error in casting arrays between `float64` and `int64` dtypes.

2. The potential error locations in the function are where the casting between dtypes occurs, particularly when trying to cast arrays to a specific dtype.

3. The error message indicates that there is a failure in casting arrays from `float64` to `int64` according to the 'safe' rule. The function `safe_cast` is designed to handle these conversions safely, but it is failing due to the non-equivalent nature of the dtypes, leading to a `TypeError` being raised.

4. One strategy for fixing this bug is to consider the conversion logic in the function, ensuring that the conversion is permissible between `float64` and `int64` dtypes. Additionally, handling the case where non-equivalent types are encountered can help prevent the `TypeError`.

5. Here is a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function with modifications to address the casting issue:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = safe_cast(block.values, np.int64, copy=False)

        if result is not no_result:
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items

def safe_cast(values, dtype, copy: bool):
    """
    Safely cast the values to the dtype if they are equivalent,
    ensuring appropriate casting behavior.
    """
    try:
        return values.astype(dtype, casting="strict", copy=copy)
    except TypeError as err:
        raise TypeError(
            f"Cannot cast array from {values.dtype} to {dtype} according to the 'safe' rule"
        ) from err
```

In this corrected version, the `safe_cast` function is explicitly used to ensure safe casting behavior. The `astype` method is called with `casting="strict"` to raise an exception if casting is not permitted according to the rule. This should help resolve the casting issues between `float64` and `int64` dtypes.
