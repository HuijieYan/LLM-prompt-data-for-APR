1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is intended to perform aggregation on blocks of data based on the specified function ('how'). The error encountered is due to a mismatch between the expected data types, specifically between 'float64' and 'int64', during an operation that involves casting the 'float64' array to 'int64'.

2. The error is likely originating from the line:
```python
return values.astype(dtype, casting="safe", copy=copy)
```
This line attempts to cast the 'values' array to the specified 'dtype', which can lead to a 'TypeError'.

3. The cause of the bug arises from the necessity to downcast an array of 'float64' elements to 'int64'. This operation fails because a 'safe' cast (`casting='safe'`) from 'float64' to 'int64' is not allowed. The error is raised when this cast operation encounters data types that are not safely convertible according to the casting rule.

4. To fix the issue, one approach is to handle the casting in a more controlled way. Specifically, the code can be modified to perform a conditional check before attempting the cast operation to ensure that the cast is safe.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        except NotImplementedError:
            alt = alt if alt is not None else lambda x, axis: x.mean(axis)
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            else:
                result = cast(DataFrame, result)
                # Process result
                # Handle potential casting issues better
                if result.dtypes.itemsize < block.dtypes.itemsize:
                    # Need to downcast if possible
                    result = result.astype(block.dtype, copy=False)

        if result is not no_result:
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    agg_blocks = [blk for blk in agg_blocks if blk is not None]

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # Return the aggregated blocks and items
```

In the corrected version:
- The cast operation within the conditional block was improved based on the downcast condition.
- The downcasting is performed only when the 'result' is computed and there is a possibility for data type mismatches.

This modification ensures that the cast operation from 'float64' to 'int64' is performed safely when applied in the aggregation scenario.
