### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is a part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class and is called during aggregation calculations.
2. The error message points to a TypeError that occurs due to an attempt to safely cast non-equivalent values during aggregation, specifically from float64 to int64.
3. The issue arises when attempting to cast floating-point values to integers for aggregation operations, and this inconsistency causes the failure.
4. To fix this bug, we should update the type handling and casting logic to handle the conversion from float64 to int64 correctly.
5. The bug can be resolved by ensuring appropriate type conversions during aggregation calculations.

### Bug Fix:
Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result  # Initialize result variable
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Include handling for non-numeric results in alternate aggregation methods
            if alt is None:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))

            result = cast(DataFrame, result)
            result = result._data.blocks[0].values

            if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
                result = result.reshape(1, -1)

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Update the locs and return aggregated blocks and items
    return agg_blocks, data.items.take(np.concatenate(new_items))
```

This fix addresses the TypeError by handling the type conversion more appropriately during aggregation calculations to ensure that float64 values are correctly cast to int64 when needed.
