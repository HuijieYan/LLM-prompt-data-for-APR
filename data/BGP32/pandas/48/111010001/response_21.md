### Analysis:
1. The error occurs when trying to cast a numpy array from `float64` to `int64` with the `casting="safe"` rule, which is not allowed.
2. The error arises when calling `values.astype(dtype, casting="safe", copy=copy)`.
3. Due to the way the function is written, it tries to implicitly cast floats to ints without proper handling of incompatible types.
4. The function needs to ensure a safe cast when converting values, particularly from floats to integers.

### Solution:
To fix this issue, we need to ensure that values are safely and explicitly cast to the desired datatype without triggering exceptions. Additionally, a more robust error handling mechanism can be implemented to account for situations where safe casting is not feasible.

### Corrected Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_object_dtype

def _safe_cast(values, dtype, copy: bool) -> np.ndarray:
    if is_object_dtype(values) or np.issubdtype(values.dtype, np.object_):
        raise TypeError("Cannot safely cast object dtype to numeric dtype")
    
    if np.issubdtype(values.dtype, np.floating) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        raise TypeError("Cannot safely cast float to integer dtype")
    
    return values.astype(dtype, copy=copy)

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        # other lines remain the same
    
            if result is not no_result:
                result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, block.dtype, dtype=dtype)
                agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # rest of the function remains the same
```

In this corrected function, a new `_safe_cast` function is introduced to handle safe casting operations based on the datatype of the values and the desired datatype. The function ensures that the explicit cast is done in a safe manner according to the defined rules.

By incorporating this change, the function should now be able to properly handle casting operations without triggering the error related to casting `float64` to `int64`.
