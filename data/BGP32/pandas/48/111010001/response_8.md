### Analysis
The error messages indicate a casting issue where the function is trying to cast a float64 array to an int64 array, causing a `TypeError`. This issue arises during the internal conversion operations within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function in the `pandas` library.

### Bug Location
The bug likely occurs in the portion of code where the function attempts to convert the `values` array to a specific `dtype`.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs due to the safe casting implementation failing for non-equivalent types, causing the TypeError to be raised.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to handle cases where conversion from float to int is not feasible or safe. We can modify the `safe_cast` function to check for equivalence and provide an alternative conversion strategy when the desired type conversion is not achievable.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

        if not pd.api.types.is_list_like(result) or isinstance(result, pd.DataFrame):
            continue

        result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs)

        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    # update the block locations
    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version should address the issue of safely casting non-equivalent types during the aggregation process within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.
