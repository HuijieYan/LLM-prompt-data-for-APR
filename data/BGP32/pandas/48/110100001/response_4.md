### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class, which is a subclass of `GroupBy`. It is used to aggregate data within a `DataFrameGroupBy` object.
2. The bug seems to be related to the handling of different block types during aggregation, specifically when encountering non-numeric data types.
3. The bug causes the function to fail when attempting to aggregate non-numeric data and results in incorrect behavior.
4. To fix the bug, we need to improve the handling of non-numeric data types during aggregation and ensure that the function can correctly aggregate all types of data.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
    def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
        for locs, block in data.items():
            result = no_result
            try:
                result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, min_count=min_count)
            except NotImplementedError:
                if alt is None:
                    raise Exception("Cannot perform the operation. Invalid function.")
    
                result = self.grouper.aggregate(block, alt)
    
            if result is not no_result:
                if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)
    
                agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result, placement=block.mgr_locs)
                agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
                new_items.append(block.mgr_locs)
    
        if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
            raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
    
        indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
        agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))
    
        for i, blk in enumerate(agg_blocks):
            loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
            blk.mgr_locs = indexer[sum(map(len, new_items[:i])) : sum(map(len, new_items[: i + 1])]
    
        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version handles the different block types during aggregation and ensures correct behavior when encountering non-numeric data types.
