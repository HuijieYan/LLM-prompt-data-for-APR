## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class is responsible for performing aggregation operations on the data based on the specified criteria.
2. The potential error locations in the function are primarily within the loop where aggregation is being performed on each block of data.
3. The reported bug might be caused by incorrect handling of data types or shapes during the aggregation process, leading to inconsistencies in the output.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the aggregation results are correctly processed and transformed back into the appropriate data structures before adding them to the final result.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array

        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            pass
        
        if result is not None:
            result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
            new_items.append(locs)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.argsort(indexer))

    for i, block in enumerate(agg_blocks):
        blk_locs = indexer[block.mgr_locs.as_array]
        block.mgr_locs = make_block(blk_locs, placement=block.mgr_locs)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items

```

By updating the error handling, type conversion, and result processing in the aggregation loop, the corrected function should now handle the aggregation process more accurately and prevent the reported bug from occurring.
