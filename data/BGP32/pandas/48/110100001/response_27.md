### Analysis:
The `_cython_agg_blocks` function in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class has several potential error locations where the bug might be originating from. These include the handling of different data types, catching exceptions, managing split blocks, and adjusting indices. The failing test `test_apply_to_nullable_integer_returns_float` is likely failing due to incorrect aggregation of data.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the function seems to be related to the aggregation logic and handling of different data types. It might be failing to correctly aggregate certain data types or encountering errors during aggregation, leading to incorrect results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly aggregates the data based on the specified method (mean, median, var) while handling different data types appropriately. Additionally, exceptions should be caught and handled properly to prevent the function from breaking.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            result = self._python_agg_block(block, how, alt, min_count)
            if result is None:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

        if isinstance(result, Block):
            agg_blocks.append(result)
            new_items.append(locs)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reordering blocks according to new_items
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        indexer = np.where(np.isin(indexer, deleted), -1, indexer)

    for agg_block in agg_blocks:
        agg_block.mgr_locs = indexer

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. The loop now correctly aggregates each block using the `self.grouper.aggregate()` method and handles `NotImplementedError` by falling back to `_python_agg_block`.
2. Deleted items are correctly managed and removed from the indexing.
3. All aggregated blocks are added to `agg_blocks` and assigned correct indexing.

By making these changes, the function should now correctly aggregate the data without encountering errors and passing the failing test.
