### Analysis:
1. The `DataFrameGroupBy` class has a method `_cython_agg_blocks` that is supposed to handle aggregation of data blocks.
2. The function loops through each block of data and aggregates them based on a given operation.
3. The bug seems to be related to handling split object-dtype blocks where the assumption of a single block input returning a single block output is not valid.
4. The function fails when trying to cast back the result to the original dtype.
5. The function also has issues with adjusting indices, especially when some blocks are excluded.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to incorrect handling of split object-dtype blocks causing errors during aggregation and dtype conversion.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle split object-dtype blocks and ensure proper casting back to the original dtype. We also need to adjust the indices and properly exclude blocks that cannot be aggregated.

### Corrected Function:
```python
    def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
        for block in data.blocks:
            result = no_result
            locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
            try:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
            except NotImplementedError:
                if alt is None:
                    deleted_items.append(locs)
                    continue
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                    obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
    
            if result is not no_result:
                result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
    
                if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                    result = type(block.values).from_array(
                        result.ravel(), None, dtype=block.values.dtype
                    )
    
                agg_block = make_block(result, locs, idx=block.items)
                new_items.append(locs)
                agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
    
        if not agg_blocks:
            raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
    
        indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
        agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))
    
        if deleted_items:
            deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
            ai = np.arange(len(data))
            mask = np.zeros(len(data))
            mask[deleted] = 1
            indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]
    
        offset = 0
        for blk in agg_blocks:
            loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
            blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : offset + loc]
            offset += loc
    
        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By making these changes, the function should be able to handle split object-dtype blocks correctly and perform the aggregation smoothly.
