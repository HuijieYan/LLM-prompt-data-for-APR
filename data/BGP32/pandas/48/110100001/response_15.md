### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is a method of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class, which inherits from `GroupBy`.
2. The buggy function is designed to aggregate data by performing a specified operation on each block of data.
3. The bug appears to be related to handling `NotImplementedError` exceptions in the try-except block, leading to incorrect aggregation of data.
4. The bug seems to be caused by the handling of non-numeric data blocks and splitting object-dtype blocks.
5. The incorrect handling of exceptions and splitting of blocks may prevent the correct aggregation of data, causing the failing tests.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Make sure to handle `NotImplementedError` exceptions properly to switch to an alternate aggregation method if necessary.
2. Ensure that object-dtype blocks are properly handled without splitting them into separate blocks.
3. Check the logic for downcasting numeric values and correct any errors related to block types.
4. Verify that the generated result is correctly cast back to the original dtype.
5. Refactor the code to avoid unintended block splits and maintain consistency in aggregation.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                raise NotImplementedError("Unsupported operation for aggregation")
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            result = cast(DataFrame, result)
            if result._data.shape[1] == 1:
                result = result.iloc[:, 0].values.reshape(1, -1)

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
    
    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
    
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))
    
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By fixing the error handling, avoiding unnecessary block splits, and ensuring correct data casting, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases.
