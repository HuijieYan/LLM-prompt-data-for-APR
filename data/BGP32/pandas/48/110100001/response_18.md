### Analysis:
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class which inherits from `GroupBy`. This function is used to aggregate data blocks when performing groupby operations.

### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function seems to be related to handling split object-dtype blocks. The code is trying to check if a DataFrame has been split into multiple blocks, but it is not handling this case correctly. This is causing issues when trying to aggregate the split blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the code properly handles the case where a DataFrame block is split into multiple blocks. This involves updating how the split blocks are processed and aggregated.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # generally if we have numeric_only=False
            # and non-applicable functions
            # try to python agg
            if alt is not None:
                obj = self.obj[block.items[locs]]
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                try:
                    result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                except TypeError:
                    continue
                else:
                    result = cast(DataFrame, result)
                    result = result._data.blocks[0].values
                    if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
                        result = result.reshape(1, -1)

        assert not isinstance(result, DataFrame)

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))
    
    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc
    
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version should now handle the case of split object-dtype blocks correctly and pass the failing test case.
