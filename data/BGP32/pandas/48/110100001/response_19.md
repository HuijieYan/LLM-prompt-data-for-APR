### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is a method within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class, which is a subclass of `GroupBy`.
2. The function is supposed to aggregate blocks of data in a pandas DataFrameGroupBy object based on the specified aggregation method.
3. The bug seems to be related to the handling of blocks of data that may need to be split into multiple blocks.
4. The cause of the bug is likely related to the logic for handling split blocks and potential errors when transforming them back into the original dtype.
5. The strategy for fixing the bug would involve re-evaluating the logic for handling split blocks and ensuring proper dtype manipulation.
6. The corrected version of the function should address the issues related to split blocks and dtype conversion.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result)
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block = make_block(transpose(convert(result)), block.items)

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    if split_items:
        for locs, result in zip(split_items, split_frames):
            for loc in locs:
                new_items.append(np.array([loc], dtype=locs.dtype))
                agg_blocks.append(result._data.blocks[0])

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (np.arange(len(data)) - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : offset + loc]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

### Changes Made:
1. Added a call to `maybe_convert_objects` to ensure that the result is properly converted.
2. Added `transpose` and `convert` functions to handle the conversion of results.
3. Updated the logic for creating `agg_block` to correctly create blocks based on the result.
4. Reorganized the indexing and offset calculations for aggregation blocks. 

By making these changes, the corrected function should now handle split blocks and dtype conversions more effectively, hopefully resolving the bug.
