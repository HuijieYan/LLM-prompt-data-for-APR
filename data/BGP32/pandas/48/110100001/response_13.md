### Analysis:
1. The `_cython_agg_blocks` function is inside the `DataFrameGroupBy` class, which extends `GroupBy`.
2. The function is responsible for aggregating data blocks based on certain conditions and handling numeric and object data types.
3. The buggy function fails to handle certain cases where exceptions are raised during aggregation, leading to incorrect results.
4. The bug likely stems from how exceptions are handled and how certain blocks are excluded or split during aggregation.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when an exception is raised during aggregation (specifically when `NotImplementedError` or `TypeError` is caught). In these cases, the block of data is supposed to be excluded from the aggregation. However, due to issues in the exception handling logic, the block is not excluded correctly, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when an exception is caught during aggregation, the corresponding block is properly excluded from further processing. This involves handling exceptions more robustly and excluding blocks that raise exceptions from the aggregation results.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result = no_result

        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except (NotImplementedError, TypeError):
            deleted_items.append(locs)
            continue

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # reset locs in blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    # code cleanup...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version introduces a more robust exception handling mechanism and ensures that blocks raising exceptions are correctly excluded from aggregation results.
