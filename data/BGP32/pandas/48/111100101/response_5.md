Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the expected input/output values, it seems that the bug lies in the way the results are handled when `min_count` is `-1`. The expected behavior should be to handle the case properly without omitting blocks from aggregation.

To fix the bug, we can update the logic in the buggy function related to the handling of `min_count`. We need to modify the code to properly handle the case when `min_count` is `-1` and ensure that all blocks are aggregated correctly without skipping any.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            result = no_result

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Prepare the items and locs for the aggregated blocks
    new_items = [np.concatenate([b.mgr_locs.as_array for b in agg_blocks])]
    agg_items = data.items.take(new_items[0])
    
    # Set the locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = BlockPlacement(slice(offset, offset + loc, 1))
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, we iterate through all blocks in the data, aggregate them based on the given `how` function, and properly handle the `min_count` condition. We then append the aggregated blocks to the list `agg_blocks` and adjust the locs accordingly.

This corrected function should now handle the cases properly where `min_count` is set to `-1` and pass all the provided test cases.
