### Analysis
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is intended to aggregate data blocks based on certain criteria. The function iterates over blocks of data, performs aggregation, and combines the results in the end. The bug seems to be related to how it handles the aggregation of data when an exception occurs. 

### Bug Explanation
The bug seems to occur when an exception is raised during the aggregation process, leading to the incorrect assignment of `deleted_items` and skipping relevant blocks. This causes the function to return incorrect results, failing the test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when an exception occurs during aggregation, the function handles the error properly. Specifically, when an exception occurs, the block should be excluded from aggregation, and the function should continue with the remaining blocks. We should also check that the exception handling and subsequent operations are correctly performed.

### Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # generally if we have numeric_only=False
            # and non-applicable functions, try to python agg
            if alt is None:
                # we cannot perform the operation in an alternate way, exclude the block
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            # call our grouper again with only this block
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                # Avoid call to self.values that can occur in DataFrame reductions
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                # we may have an exception in trying to aggregate
                # continue and exclude the block
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            else:
                result = cast(DataFrame, result)
                # unwrap DataFrame to get array
                if len(result._mgr.blocks) != 1:
                    # We've split an object block
                    split_items.append(locs)
                    split_frames.append(result)
                    continue

                result = result._mgr.blocks[0].values
                if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)

        assert not isinstance(result, DataFrame)

        if result is not no_result:
            # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                try:
                    # Cast back if feasible
                    result = type(block.values)._from_sequence(
                        result.ravel(), dtype=block.values.dtype
                    )
                except ValueError:
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    if split_items:
        for locs, result in zip(split_items, split_frames):
            assert len(locs) == result.shape[1]
            for i, loc in enumerate(locs):
                new_items.append(np.array([loc], dtype=locs.dtype))
                agg_blocks.append(result.iloc[:, [i]]._mgr.blocks[0])

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing test cases.
