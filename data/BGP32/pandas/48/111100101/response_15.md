## Bug Analysis
The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function stems from the handling of the `self.obj` DataFrame when calculating aggregated values. In particular, the bug occurs when the calculated result of the aggregation is a DataFrame instead of a numpy array. This results in an assertion error when checking the type of `result` and handling it during the aggregation process.

## Bug Explanation
When the aggregation result is a DataFrame, the code incorrectly assumes it will always be cast back to the original dtype which leads to an error. Additionally, the code does not handle the case where the DataFrame result has been split into multiple blocks properly, resulting in incorrect indexing and block management.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling the DataFrame result of the aggregation. We also need to ensure proper handling of split DataFrame blocks and alignment of the resulting blocks with the original data.

## Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # Actual computation
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[int] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

        if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            result_np = result.to_numpy()
            result_np = maybe_downcast_numeric(result_np, block.dtype)
        else:
            result_np = maybe_convert_objects(result)

        if result_np is None:
            deleted_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
            continue

        agg_block: Block = make_block(result_np)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Extracting the result blocks
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    # Resetting locs in the blocks
    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = BlockPlacement(np.arange(offset, offset + loc))
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version properly handles DataFrame results, converts the result to a numpy array, and correctly aligns the indices for the aggregated data blocks. This should resolve the bug and pass the failing test cases.
