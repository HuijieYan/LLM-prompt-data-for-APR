Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the expected input/output values, it seems the bug lies in the handling of the aggregation results and creation of the aggregated blocks. The current logic in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function does not properly handle the multiple possible scenarios that can arise during aggregation.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling the aggregation results and ensuring that the aggregated blocks are created correctly with the proper data and indices.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Handle the case of non-numeric aggregation functions
            if alt is None:
                raise NotImplementedError("Non-numeric aggregation functions are not supported.")
            else:
                # Apply the alternate function for non-numeric aggregation
                result = alt(block.values, axis=self.axis)

        result = maybe_convert_objects(result)

        agg_block = make_block(result, placement=block.mgr_locs)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    agg_items = data.items.take(np.concatenate(new_items))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

Make sure to update the function in the correct location in the `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` file.

This corrected version of the function should now properly handle the aggregation results and create the aggregated blocks as expected, passing all test cases provided.
