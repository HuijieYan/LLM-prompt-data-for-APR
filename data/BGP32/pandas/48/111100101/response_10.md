## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks()` is intended to aggregate data based on specific functions like mean, median, or variance. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of missing values (NA) within the DataFrame object during the aggregation process. The behavior of the function is inconsistent when NA values are present in the input DataFrame.

The issues stem from the block handling when encountering NA values, resulting in incorrect aggregation and transformation of the data. This inconsistency leads to failing test cases, as the output results do not match the expected values provided in the test cases.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks()` function, the correct handling of NA values during aggregation needs to be implemented. Specifically, when encountering NA values during aggregation, the function should exclude these values from the calculation and maintain the integrity of the aggregation process.

The key areas to focus on for fixing the bug are:
1. Ensure proper handling of NA values in the Block data structure.
2. Modify the aggregation logic to skip NA values during the calculation.
3. Update the Block and DataFrame aggregation workflow to handle missing values correctly.

By addressing these areas, the corrected function will be able to produce accurate aggregation results even when NA values are present in the input DataFrame.

## Bug-fixed Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks()` function after addressing the bug:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )
        # Exclude blocks with NA values
        if pd.NA in result:
            continue

        result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, block.dtype)
        agg_block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By incorporating the correct handling of missing values and ensuring that NA values are handled appropriately during aggregation, this updated version of the function should produce accurate results and pass the failing test cases.
