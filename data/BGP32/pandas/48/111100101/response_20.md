### Bug Fix Strategy
The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function seems to be related to incorrect handling of data blocks and their aggregation. The function is not properly dealing with split blocks and assigning new items.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the aggregation process correctly handles different block types and their aggregation operations. We also need to update the `agg_blocks` and `new_items` lists accordingly.

The main steps in the bug fixing strategy are as follows:
1. Ensure that the numeric data is correctly extracted for aggregation.
2. Aggregate the data blocks while handling different block types (integer vs float vs extension blocks).
3. Update the `agg_blocks` and `new_items` lists with the results of the aggregation.
4. Adjust the indexer and update the locs in the blocks to maintain the correct ordering.

### Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        if issubclass(block.dtype.type, np.integer) or pd.api.types.is_extension_array_dtype(block.dtype):
            result = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        else:
            if alt is None:
                raise NotImplementedError("Alternate aggregation method not implemented")
            else:
                result = alt(block.values, axis=1)

        if not isinstance(result, np.ndarray) or result.ndim != 2 or result.shape[0] != 1:
            raise DataError("Invalid result shape after aggregation")

        result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

        agg_block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    offset = 0
    for agg_block in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(agg_block.mgr_locs)
        agg_block.mgr_locs = BlockPlacement(slice(offset, offset + loc, 1))
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version should address the issues with the original function and enable it to pass the failing tests with the specified input/output values.
