### Analysis
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is responsible for aggregating blocks of data based on specified criteria. The function processes the data block by block, applying the aggregation function. The bug might be related to the handling of the aggregation result and building the aggregated blocks.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the function might be related to how the result of the aggregation is handled and how the aggregated blocks are created. Specifically, there could be issues with identifying the correct values for the agg_block, new_items, indexer, and other relevant variables.

### Suggested Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the aggregation result is correctly handled and that the aggregated blocks are created properly. It is essential to verify the data flow within the loop that processes each block and make sure that the necessary variables contain the expected values at each step.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    agg_items = data.items
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)

    offset = 0
    for agg_block in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(agg_block.mgr_locs)
        agg_block.mgr_locs = BlockPlacement(slice(offset, offset + loc, 1))
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version ensures that the aggregation result is correctly handled and that the aggregated blocks are created and indexed properly.

Please test this corrected version against the provided test cases to ensure that it functions as expected. If there are additional bugs or issues, further investigation may be needed.
