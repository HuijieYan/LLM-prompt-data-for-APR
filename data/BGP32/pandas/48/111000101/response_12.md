### Analysis:
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is intended to perform aggregation on data blocks within a `DataFrameGroupBy` instance using the specified aggregation function. The function iterates over the data blocks, conducts aggregation, and constructs new blocks for the aggregated results.

#### Identified Issue:
The bug seems to arise due to incorrect handling of the aggregation result when `how` is not applicable or when an exception occurs during aggregation. In such cases, the script fails to appropriately handle the flow of data and leads to incorrect results.

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Properly handle exceptions that may occur during aggregation and adjust the flow accordingly.
2. Ensure that the logic for handling aggregated results and constructing new blocks is correctly implemented.
3. Verify that the final aggregated results are correctly stored in new blocks and returned along with the related items.

### Bug-fixed Version:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = None
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is not None:
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                try:
                    result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                except TypeError:
                    deleted_items.append(locs)
            else:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
        
        if result is not None:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            agg_block = block.make_block(result)

            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : offset + loc]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This fixed version addresses the issues identified, specifically by handling exceptions appropriately during aggregation and ensuring the construction of new blocks with the aggregated results is correctly managed.
