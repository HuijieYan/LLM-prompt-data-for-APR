The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` has an issue in the case where an exception is raised during aggregation. The function attempts to catch the `NotImplementedError` exception and handle the case accordingly. However, the exception handling code does not properly exclude the block if a specific condition is met. This leads to unexpected behavior when trying to deal with a block that cannot be aggregated in the intended way.

Here is a strategy to fix the bug:
1. When catching a `NotImplementedError`, the function should check if an alternate method (`alt`) is provided. If it is not provided (`alt is None`), then the block should be excluded.
2. If an alternate method is available, it should be applied to the block and stored as the result. If an exception occurs during this process, the block should also be excluded.

Based on the error analysis and the strategy to fix the bug, here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                # Exclude the block
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            try:
                result = alt(block.values, axis=self.axis)
            except Exception:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
        
        assert not isinstance(result, DataFrame)

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                assert result.ndim == 1 or result.shape[0] == 1
                try:
                    result = type(block.values)._from_sequence(
                        result.ravel(), dtype=block.values.dtype
                    )
                except ValueError:
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
    
    if split_items:
        for locs, result in zip(split_items, split_frames):
            assert len(locs) == result.shape[1]
            for i, loc in enumerate(locs):
                new_items.append(np.array([loc], dtype=locs.dtype))
                agg_blocks.append(result.iloc[:, [i]]._data.blocks[0])

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version of the function includes the necessary modifications to properly handle exceptions and exclude blocks when needed. It aligns with the identified bug and fixes the issue according to the expected behavior specified for various cases.
