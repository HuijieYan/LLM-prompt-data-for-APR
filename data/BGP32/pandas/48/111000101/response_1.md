### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is intended to perform aggregation on a grouped DataFrame by applying the given function (`how`) to the data.
- The code is structured to iterate through each block in the data, perform aggregation (either through the grouper or an alternate function), and create new blocks for the resulting aggregated values.
- There is a process for handling split object-dtype blocks that may occur during aggregation.
- The key expected output from this function is a list of `agg_blocks` and `agg_items` representing the aggregated data blocks and their corresponding items after aggregation.

### Bug:
- The bug seems to be related to the handling of DataFrame types and the aggregation process within the for loop iterating over blocks.
- The code is trying to downcast the result to numeric types even if the result is not valid or an exception is thrown during aggregation.
- There might be issues with the manipulation of the split object-dtype blocks.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the result of aggregation is valid and handle exceptions gracefully.
2. Ensure that the split object-dtype blocks are managed correctly and aggregated appropriately.
3. Double-check the handling of object types during the aggregation process.
