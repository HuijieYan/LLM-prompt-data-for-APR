The buggy function is intended to perform aggregation on blocks using specific criteria. The bug appears to be centered around the handling of exceptions and the incorrect conditional flow. The main issue arises in the try-except block where certain exceptions are caught, but the control flow that follows may not be accurate, leading to unexpected results.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the conditional branches are properly handled, and error cases are managed correctly without causing unexpected behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            obj = self.obj.iloc[:, locs]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    # Adjust the indexer to account for the items we have removed
    indexer -= np.arange(len(data))[np.concatenate(deleted_items)]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version addresses the branching issues and makes the error handling more robust. It should now correctly handle the aggregation process based on the specified criteria.
