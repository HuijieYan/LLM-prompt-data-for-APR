### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` aims to perform aggregation on data blocks in a DataFrameGroupBy object.
2. The function looks for numeric data and then aggregates the values based on the specified method ('how') and the minimum count of observations required for aggregation ('min_count').
3. The bug seems to be related to the handling of different data types and the aggregation process when encountering non-numeric data.
4. The function is expected to return a list of aggregated data blocks and the corresponding items index.

### Bug:
The bug occurs when the function encounters non-numeric data and attempts to aggregate it using an alternate method ('alt'). This part of the code is prone to data type mismatches and errors, leading to incorrect aggregation results.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper handling of non-numeric data during the aggregation process and prevent type-related errors that might arise.

### Correction:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

        if result is not None:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = BlockPlacement(slice(offset, offset + loc, 1))
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

Now, the corrected function should handle non-numeric data properly during aggregation, avoiding the bugs related to type errors and incorrect results.
