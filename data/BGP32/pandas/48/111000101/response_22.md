## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is expected to aggregate data based on certain conditions and return a list of Block objects along with an Index object. The function seems to iterate over each block in the data, perform aggregation, and store the results in `agg_blocks`. However, there are some issues leading to unexpected behavior.

### Issues
1. The variable `agg_block` is being defined conditionally inside the loop, but it is added to the `agg_blocks` list outside the loop. This is causing data mismatch as `agg_blocks` contains a reference to `agg_block` which might change in the next iteration.
2. The condition `if result is not no_result` is used to check if the aggregation was successful, but the `agg_block` is defined even if the result is not assigned to it. This can lead to adding incorrect or uninitialized blocks to `agg_blocks`.
3. The resetting of `locs` as indexing positions is not consistent across the function. Any change in indexing should be reflected properly to maintain data integrity.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Initialize `agg_block` before the loop starts and only update it when the aggregation is successful.
2. Add the updated `agg_block` to `agg_blocks` within the loop after updating it.
3. Ensure that the resetting of locs and the final indexing are done properly to maintain the correct ordering.

To fix the issues, the logic for updating `agg_block` and resetting locs needs adjustments.

## Bug Fix
Here is a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    
    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result = no_result
        
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is not None:
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                    obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                try:
                    result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                except TypeError:
                    pass
                else:
                    result = cast(DataFrame, result)
                    if len(result._data.blocks) == 1:
                        result = result._data.blocks[0].values
                        if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
                            result = result.reshape(1, -1)
        
        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            
            if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                try:
                    result = type(block.values)._from_sequence(
                        result.ravel(), dtype=block.values.dtype
                    )
                except ValueError:
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)
                    
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
        
    indexer = np.concatenate([block.mgr_locs.as_array for block in agg_blocks])
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

The corrected version should address the issues and provide the expected functionality for all cases.
