### Analysis:
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is expected to take in parameters `how: str`, `alt=None`, `numeric_only: bool = True`, and `min_count: int = -1`. The function is supposed to work on a `BlockManager` object obtained from the `_get_data_to_aggregate` function within the same class. The function then processes the data by aggregating values based on the provided `how` function.

- The function iterates through blocks of data, attempts to aggregate them based on the `how` function and handles exceptions accordingly.
- It creates new blocks based on the aggregated result and adjusts the indexes accordingly.
- Finally, it returns the aggregated blocks and items.

### Bugs:
1. In the case when an exception occurs during aggregation due to the `NotImplementedError`, the code does not handle the situation correctly. Instead, it misses the alternative processing (`alt`) logic and skips directly to assigning the result to the `agg_block` variable. This leads to wrong outcomes and potentially missing data.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when an exception occurs due to `NotImplementedError`, the code handles the alternative logic provided in the `alt` parameter correctly. This would involve executing the alternative logic (if provided) and ensuring that the aggregation process occurs smoothly even in the case of exceptions.

### Solution:
I will provide a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                # Handle alternative logic or exclude block
                raise NotImplementedError("Alternative logic not provided for aggregation")
            else:
                obj = self.obj[block.items[0]]
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                result = s.transform(lambda x: alt(x, axis=1))

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)

            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version handles the alternative logic correctly when a `NotImplementedError` is raised during aggregation. It ensures that the aggregation process continues smoothly even in such cases.
