### Bug Analysis:
The bug is related to a TypeError being raised when calling the `mean`, `median`, or `var` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` dtype. The issue arises when attempting to cast float values to int values which is not possible in this context.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to a data type casting issue where float values are attempted to be cast to int values during aggregation. This conflict between float and int types leads to a `TypeError` being raised during the process.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the data type conversion is handled properly when performing the aggregation using the `mean`, `median`, or `var` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` dtype. We need to address the mismatch between float and int types causing the error.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, which includes handling the dtype conversion issue:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            grouping_result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, min_count=min_count)
        except NotImplementedError:
            grouping_result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, 'mean', min_count=min_count)

        result = grouping_result[0]
        
        if isinstance(result, float) and np.issubdtype(block.dtype, np.integer):
            result = int(round(result))
        
        # Create a new Block with the aggregated result and add it to agg_blocks
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
    
    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
    
    # Reset locs to correspond to current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version:
1. When performing aggregation, we handle the case where the result dtype is float but the original dtype is int64 by rounding the result and converting it to int to avoid the casting issue.
2. The code ensures that the appropriate dtype conversion is applied when necessary during the aggregation process.

By applying these changes, the `TypeError` related to casting float to int should be resolved in the corrected function.
