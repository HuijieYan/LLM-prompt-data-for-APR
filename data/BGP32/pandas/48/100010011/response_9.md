### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs when calling the `mean`, `median`, or `var` functions on a DataFrameGroupBy object with an `Int64` dtype. It results in a `TypeError` when trying to convert `float64` to `int64` according to the 'safe' rule.

#### Bug Location:
The bug is likely occurring in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, especially during the attempted cast from `float64` to `int64` while performing aggregation operations.

#### Bug Cause:
The function attempts to cast the result of aggregation to the original block's dtype, which may result in a mismatch between float and integer dtypes, leading to a `TypeError`. The issue is related to the casting operation in the context of nullable integers.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the cast operation from float to int during aggregation takes into account the specifics of nullable integers. This may involve more careful dtype checking and handling during the aggregation process.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
        new_items.append(agg_block.mgr_locs)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version simplifies the aggregation process by directly performing the aggregation and construction of new blocks without attempting dtype conversions that may cause TypeErrors. This version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
