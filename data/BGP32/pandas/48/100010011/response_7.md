### Analysis:
- The error message indicates a `TypeError` related to casting from `float64` to `int64`.
- The error occurred when calling aggregate functions like `mean`, `median`, and `var` after grouping.
- The error is likely due to inappropriate casting of values during aggregation.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by an incorrect cast between `float64` and `int64` when aggregating data after grouping.

### Bug Fix:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the proper data type conversion is handled during aggregation to avoid the `TypeError`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
from pandas.core.internals.managers import BaseBlock
from pandas.core.indexes.base import Index

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result = no_result

        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            deleted_items.append(locs)
            continue

        assert not isinstance(result, DataFrame)

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block = BaseBlock(result, placement=block.mgr_locs)

            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

### Summary of Changes Made:
- Replaced the `safe_cast` function with `maybe_downcast_to_dtype` for type conversion.
- Updated the logic for handling aggregation and conversion of data types.
- Fixed the handling of aggregated blocks and indexes to resolve the type casting issue.

By making the above corrections, the function should now handle aggregation with proper type conversions, addressing the `TypeError` reported in the GitHub issue.
