### Bug Analysis:
The error message `TypeError: Cannot cast array from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') according to the rule 'safe'` suggests that there is an issue with safely casting floating-point values to integer values, specifically when using the `astype` method with casting set to 'safe'. This error occurs during the aggregation process when calling functions like `mean`, `median`, or `var`.

The issue posted on GitHub provides a reproducible example that showcases the problem of calling `mean` on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype resulting in a TypeError.

### Bug Location:
The bug seems to be related to the handling of data types during the aggregation process within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. The error occurs when trying to cast float64 values to int64 in a safe manner.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function attempts to cast `values` to a specified `dtype` using `values.astype(dtype, casting="safe", copy=copy)`. The `casting="safe"` option enforces safe casting rules between data types. However, in the cases where the values are float64 and need to be cast to int64, this results in a TypeError due to the "safe" rule not being able to cast non-equivalent float64 values to int64.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the conversion from float64 to int64 in a manner that ensures safe casting without causing a TypeError. One approach is to modify the `safe_cast` function to explicitly handle the conversion between float64 and int64. This can be achieved by checking if the values are integer-equivalent before casting.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]:

    # Existing implementation of the function...

    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Exception handling part remains the same

    # Existing logic for handling agg_blocks and returning

    return agg_blocks, agg_items

def safe_cast(values, dtype, copy: bool):
    """
    Safely cast the values to the dtype if they
    are equivalent, meaning floats must be equivalent to the
    ints.

    """
    try:
        return values.astype(dtype, copy=copy)
    except ValueError:
        # If safe casting fails, attempt a manual conversion from float64 to int64
        if np.issubdtype(values.dtype, np.floating) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
            # Check if the values are integer-equivalent
            if np.allclose(values, np.round(values)):
                # Perform manual conversion from float64 to int64
                return values.astype(dtype).astype(dtype)
            else:
                raise TypeError(f"cannot safely cast non-equivalent {values.dtype} to {np.dtype(dtype)}")
        else:
            raise TypeError(f"cannot safely cast {values.dtype} to {np.dtype(dtype)}")
```

By updating the `safe_cast` function, we provide a fallback mechanism to manually handle safe casting from float64 to int64 by first checking if the floating-point values are actually integer-equivalent before casting. This modification should address the casting issue and resolve the TypeError during the aggregation process.

### This fix should resolve the casting issue and allow the `mean`, `median`, and `var` functions to work correctly with Int64 data types in a DataFrameGroupBy context.
