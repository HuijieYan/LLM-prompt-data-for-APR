### Analysis:
The error arises from trying to cast a float64 dtype to int64, which is not allowed according to the 'safe' casting rule. This error occurs when calling specific aggregation functions like mean, median, and var on a DataFrameGroupBy object with columns of type 'Int64'.

### Potential Error Locations:
- The function `_cython_agg_blocks` might be handling the casting incorrectly when downcasting to the original dtype after aggregation.
- The function `safe_cast` might not be handling the casting appropriately.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the attempt to cast non-equivalent float64 values to int64 in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, which is required for certain aggregation operations. This type casting error leads to the TypeError observed in the failing test cases.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug:
1. Ensure that the casting from float64 to int64 is handled properly, taking into account the specific dtype conversion rules.
2. Check the `safe_cast` function to ensure it properly handles non-equivalent casting situations.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            else:
                result = cast(np.ndarray, result)
                if len(result.shape) == 1:
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.argsort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = np.where(np.logical_not(mask))[0][indexer]

    offset = 0
    for agg_block in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(agg_block.mgr_locs)
        agg_block.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : offset + loc]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should properly handle the type casting issue and resolve the TypeError observed in the failing test cases related to mean, median, and var aggregation operations.
