## Analysis:
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is responsible for aggregating data blocks based on the specified aggregation function. The function loops through the data blocks, applies the aggregation function, and constructs new blocks with the aggregated results.

## Error Locations:
1. The use of `no_result` to check for invalid results is not effectively handled.
2. Handling split object-dtype blocks has issues with reshaping and conversion.
3. The conditional check for DataFrame output is not working as intended.
4. Cleanup of split blocks is incorrect.
5. Handling of deleted items and adjusting indexer based on removed items is problematic.

## Root Cause:
The cause of the bug is primarily due to improper handling of potential exceptions, incorrect assumptions about block types, and incomplete cleanup of split blocks.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Improve the handling of potential errors during aggregation.
2. Adjust the logic for split object-dtype blocks.
3. Correctly identify DataFrame output and handle it.
4. Properly cleanup split blocks and adjust indexes for deleted items.

## Corrected Version:

    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = None

            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:

        if result is not None:
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result, copy=False)
            agg_block = make_block(result, placement=locs, klass=block.__class__)

            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    if split_items:
        for locs, result in zip(split_items, split_frames):
            for i, loc in enumerate(locs):
                new_items.append(np.array([loc], dtype=locs.dtype))
                agg_blocks.append(make_block(result.iloc[:, [i]], placement=[loc], klass=Block))

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.argsort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        indexer = np.array([np.where(indexer == x)[0][0] for x in np.arange(len(data)) if x not in deleted])

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset: offset + loc]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version of the function `_cython_agg_blocks`, I have addressed the identified issues and made necessary adjustments to ensure proper aggregation, handling of exceptions, cleanup operations, and index adjustments.
