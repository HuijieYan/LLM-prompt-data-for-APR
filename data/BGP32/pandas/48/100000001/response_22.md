### Analyzing the Buggy Function:

The function `_cython_agg_blocks` is designed to perform aggregation on blocks of data in the context of groupby operations. The function takes parameters such as `how` (aggregation method), `alt` (alternate method), `numeric_only` (flag for considering numeric data only), and `min_count` (minimum count for aggregation).

### Potential Error Locations:

1. Exception Handling: Handling exceptions like `NotImplementedError` and `TypeError` might lead to inconsistent behavior.
2. Type Inconsistencies: Checking the type of the result and potentially casting it back to the original data type can lead to issues.
3. Split Blocks: Handling split object-dtype blocks might not produce the expected results.
4. Data Cleaning: Cleaning up split blocks and adjusting the indexer could introduce bugs.
5. DataError Exception: Raising `DataError` without detailed information may not provide helpful feedback.

### Explanation of the Bug:

The bug might occur due to inconsistent handling of different types of operations within the loop that iterates over data blocks. In particular, issues might arise when dealing with split blocks, casting block data types, and adjusting indexing based on deleted items.

### Suggested Bug Fix Strategy:

1. Simplify the exception handling to avoid unexpected behaviors.
2. Ensure consistent handling of different data types and operations.
3. Improve the logic related to split blocks and data cleaning.
4. Enhance error reporting to provide more meaningful messages.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

Here is a revised version of the function `_cython_agg_blocks` with potential bug fixes:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        if result is not None:
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No data to aggregate")

    # adjust indexer if items are deleted
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset:offset + loc]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This revised version simplifies the logic by removing unnecessary exception handling and focusing on consistent aggregation operations. It also improves error handling by raising a meaningful exception when there is no data to aggregate.
