## Analysis:
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is designed to aggregate data based on a specified condition, but it has multiple potential error locations. One of the key issues lies in the handling of the `agg_block` variable, which may not always be defined correctly based on the flow of the function. Additionally, the logic dealing with split blocks in the `split_items` section may lead to incorrect behavior.

## Bug Cause:
The bug arises primarily due to the inconsistent handling of the `agg_block` variable and the split blocks. When the control flow enters the block handling the case when `result` is not equal to `no_result`, the assignment of `agg_block` relies on this condition. However, in some scenarios, `agg_block` may not be correctly defined or initialized, leading to potential errors or incorrect outputs.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, it is essential to ensure that `agg_block` is properly defined and set in all relevant scenarios within the function. Moreover, the processing of split blocks in the `split_items` section needs to be revisited to ensure the correct aggregation of data. By addressing these issues, the function can be optimized to handle the aggregation process accurately.

## Corrected Version:
After analyzing the buggy function and understanding the potential error locations and causes, here is a corrected version of the function `_cython_agg_blocks`:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                result = type(block.values)._from_sequence(
                    result.ravel(), dtype=block.values.dtype
                )

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    for locs, result in zip(split_items, split_frames):
        assert len(locs) == result.shape[1]
        for i, loc in enumerate(locs):
            new_items.append(np.array([loc], dtype=locs.dtype))
            agg_block = result.iloc[:, [i]]._data.blocks[0]
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version, the assignment of `agg_block` is consistent and properly handled within the loop. Moreover, the handling of split blocks has been revised to ensure the correct aggregation of data. This corrected version should address the bugs and improve the function's functionality.
