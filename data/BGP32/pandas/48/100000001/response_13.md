The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is intended to perform aggregation on multiple blocks of data based on a specified operation `how`. It iterates through each block, applies the aggregation operation, and stores the results in a list of output blocks.

### Potential Errors:
1. Inconsistent usage of `locs` and `new_items` lists causing potential index mismatch.
2. Error handling in case of incompatible aggregation operations.
3. Handling of split object-dtype blocks may lead to incorrect behavior.
4. Potential index adjustments for deleted items are not correctly implemented.

### Bug Explanation:
One key issue in the original code is the inconsistent handling of `locs` and `new_items` lists when processing blocks of data. If an aggregation operation results in a split block (e.g., after applying an alternate method), the `locs` array used for indexing the block may not align correctly with the `new_items` list. This leads to index mismatching and potential errors in the resulting aggregated data.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To address the bug and ensure correct aggregation results:
1. Ensure consistent handling of `locs` and `new_items` lists to maintain proper indexing.
2. Improve error handling for incompatible aggregation operations.
3. Enhance the handling of split object-dtype blocks to prevent incorrect assumptions.
4. Implement proper index adjustments for deleted items to maintain data integrity.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function addressing the identified issues:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    # Handle processed blocks and deleted items separately
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[block.items[0]]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))

        if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            result = result._data.blocks[0].values

        # Downcast and process aggregated block
        result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
        agg_block = block.make_block(result)

        new_items.append(agg_block.mgr_locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Adjust indices for deleted items if any
    if deleted_items:
        indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        indexer = np.delete(indexer, np.searchsorted(indexer, deleted))

    # Update the locations in the aggregated blocks
    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version focuses on maintaining proper index alignment, improving error handling, and ensuring accurate aggregation results. It addresses the identified bugs and aims to provide a more reliable and efficient aggregation mechanism within the function.
