The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is related to the handling of `split_items` and `split_frames` when processing aggregated data blocks. It is caused by assuming a single block input results in a single block output, which is not always the case when dealing with object-dtype blocks that might be split into multiple blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct data processing handling is applied to split items and frames. We should adjust the logic to handle this scenario properly and combine the split blocks back into a single block for aggregation.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            else:
                result = cast(DataFrame, result)
                result_blocks = result._data.blocks
                if len(result_blocks) > 1:
                    # Handling split object blocks
                    split_items.append(locs)
                    split_frames.extend(result_blocks)
                    continue

                result = result_blocks[0].values

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                try:
                    result = type(block.values)._from_sequence(result.ravel(), dtype=block.values.dtype)
                except ValueError:
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
    
    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Handle split items for aggregation
    for locs, result in zip(split_items, split_frames):
        for i, loc in enumerate(locs):
            new_items.append(np.array([loc], dtype=locs.dtype))
            agg_blocks.append(result.iloc[:, [i]]._data.blocks[0])

    # Rest of the code remains same...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version, the handling of split items and frames has been updated to properly process and combine them back into a single block for aggregation. Make sure to test the function to ensure the bug is fixed and the function works as expected.
