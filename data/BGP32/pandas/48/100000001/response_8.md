### Analysis:
The `_cython_agg_blocks` function is intended to aggregate blocks of data based on a specified aggregation method. However, there are several potential error locations within the function that could lead to incorrect behavior or unexpected results. 

### Identified Issues:
1. Inconsistent handling of `agg_block` creation within the loop.
2. Potential errors with handling split items.
3. Issue with adjusting locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering.

### Explanation of Bug:
The bug in the function arises from the inconsistent handling of creating `agg_block` within the loop. If the operations within the loop result in splitting blocks or excluding certain items, the subsequent processing to create `agg_block` and adjust locs can lead to unexpected behavior.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that consistent handling of creating `agg_block` is maintained throughout the loop. Additionally, proper handling of splitting blocks and adjusting locs is crucial for correct aggregation.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                if how == "ohlc":
                    deleted_items.append(locs)
                    continue
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Adjust the locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version addresses the issues identified and is structured to ensure consistent aggregation handling and proper adjustment of locs for the aggregated blocks.
