The bug in the provided function is related to the split_items and split_frames lists. These lists are not being handled correctly, causing potential issues in the aggregation process when dealing with split object-dtype blocks.

The cause of the bug is that the logic to handle split object-dtype blocks is incomplete and results in improper handling of cases where a block is split into multiple parts during aggregation.

To fix the bug, we can implement a more robust handling mechanism for split object-dtype blocks within the _cython_agg_blocks function. We need to ensure that when encountering split frames, the function correctly processes and combines them for aggregation.

Here is the corrected version of the function with improvements to handle split object-dtype blocks properly:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_blocks: List[Tuple[int, DataFrame]] = []  # Stores the split blocks

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

            assert not isinstance(result, DataFrame)

            if result is not no_result:
                result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

                agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
                new_items.append(locs)
                agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
            else:
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]].iloc[:, 0]
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                try:
                    result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                except TypeError:
                    deleted_items.append(locs)
                else:
                    result = cast(DataFrame, result)
                    if len(result) > 1:
                        for i in range(len(result.columns)):
                            split_blocks.append((locs[i], result.iloc[:, i]))

    if not (agg_blocks or split_blocks):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    for locs, result in split_blocks:
        assert len(locs) == len(result)
        for i, loc in enumerate(locs):
            new_locs = np.array([loc], dtype=locs.dtype)
            new_items.append(new_locs)
            agg_blocks.append(block.make_block(result.iloc[:, i]))


    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version, I introduced the `split_blocks` list to store split blocks, and appropriately handle them by iterating over each split block and adding them to the aggregation process. This ensures that split object-dtype blocks are correctly processed and aggregated within the function.
