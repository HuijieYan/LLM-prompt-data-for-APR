### Analysis:
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is intended to aggregate blocks of data based on a specified aggregation function (`how`). It loops through the blocks in the data, aggregates each block based on the specified function, and then constructs new aggregated blocks. The bug seems to be related to handling split object-dtype blocks.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of split object-dtype blocks where `result` might not be a single block output.
2. Managing the indexes and locs of the aggregated blocks.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs when the code expects a single block output after aggregation, but in some cases, the result contains multiple blocks (specifically in the case of split object-dtype blocks). This leads to incorrect handling of the result data and indexing issues.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the result of aggregation contains multiple blocks and handle this scenario appropriately.
2. Update the indexing and locs assignment logic to ensure correct alignment with the aggregated blocks.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]
            
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

        if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            for i in range(result.shape[1]):
                new_locs = np.array([locs[0]], dtype=locs.dtype)
                new_items.append(new_locs)
                agg_blocks.append(block.make_block(result.iloc[:, i].values))

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version, the function now correctly handles split object-dtype blocks by iterating over the columns of the resulting DataFrame and creating separate blocks for each column. Additionally, the indexing and locs management is updated to align with the aggregated blocks. This should address the bugs in the original `_cython_agg_blocks` function.
