### Analysis:
The bug seems to be related to a TypeError when calling `mean()` on a DataFrameGroupBy object with Int64 dtype. The issue description mentions that the error does not occur when calling `min`, `max`, or `first`, but does happen with `median` and `std`. This bug appears to be caused by a specific data type (`Int64`) behavior.

### Potential Error Location:
The bug might be occurring in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function where aggregation is taking place. There might be a data type compatibility issue or incorrect casting leading to the TypeError.

### Bug Cause:
The bug likely arises due to type inference or casting within the aggregation process of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. Since the issue is specifically related to `mean`, `median`, and `std`, it may involve a numeric type mismatch when performing these calculations on `Int64` dtype values.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the aggregation process handles the `Int64` dtype correctly when performing operations like `mean`, `median`, and `std`. This might involve revisiting the data type casting logic within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

### Corrected Version:
Here is a suggested corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to address the TypeError issue when calling `mean()` on a DataFrameGroupBy object with `Int64` dtype.

```python
# Fixed version of the _cython_agg_blocks function
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        if result is not None:
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the provided corrected version, adjustments have been made to ensure proper handling of the aggregation results and data types, which should help resolve the TypeError issue when calling `mean()` on a DataFrameGroupBy object with `Int64` dtype.
