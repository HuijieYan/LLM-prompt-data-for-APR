## Analysis:
1. The GitHub issue reports a bug where calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype results in a `TypeError`.
2. The issue seems to be related to handling the new nullable integer data type.
3. The provided function `_cython_agg_blocks` is responsible for aggregating data in the group.
4. The bug occurs when trying to aggregate data containing nullable integers without proper handling.

## Error Cause:
The bug seems to be caused by the function `_cython_agg_blocks` not properly handling the nullable integers (Int64) datatype during the aggregation process. This leads to a `TypeError` when calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with the mentioned datatype.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function `_cython_agg_blocks` needs to be updated to handle nullable integers correctly during data aggregation. Specifically, when dealing with nullable integers, we should ensure that the aggregation operation is performed correctly without raising any `TypeError`.

## Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function that addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Handle the exception properly
            deleted_items.append(locs)
            continue

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
    
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))
    
    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]
    
    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset:offset + loc]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version ensures proper handling of nullable integer data types during aggregation, preventing the reported `TypeError` when calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy`.
