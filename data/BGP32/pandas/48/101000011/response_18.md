### Analysis:
The reported issue on GitHub involves calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with a column of `Int64` dtype, resulting in a `TypeError`. This error occurs when using nullable integer data types, and it happens specifically when aggregating the data using the `mean`, `median`, or `std` functions.

### Error Location:
The bug is likely in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` file. The function is responsible for aggregating block data in Cython for a grouped DataFrame, and it may not be handling nullable integer data types correctly.

### Bug Cause:
The issue is likely caused by the `._cython_agg_blocks` function's handling of numeric data types, specifically when dealing with nullable integers (Int64). The error occurs when attempting aggregation functions that are incompatible with the nullable integer data type.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_cython_agg_blocks` function properly handles nullable integer data types during aggregation. This includes accommodating the special characteristics of nullable integers in the aggregation logic to prevent the `TypeError` when calling functions like `mean`, `median`, or `std`.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function in the `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` file:

```python
    def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
        
        # Convert nullable integers to regular integers for compatibility
        data = maybe_convert_objects(data, convert_dates=False, convert_numeric=True)
    
        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        
        for block in data.blocks:
            # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
            result = no_result
            locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
            try:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
            except NotImplementedError:
                # Handle incompatible aggregation operations
                
            # Additional aggregation logic...
            # (Continue the unchanged parts of the function)
    
        if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
            raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
        
        # Continue with the remaining parts of the function...
```

By converting the nullable integer data to regular integers using `maybe_convert_objects`, the corrected function ensures that the aggregation logic can handle nullable integer data types correctly. This adjustment should resolve the `TypeError` issue when using the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with a column of `Int64` type.
