### Analysis:
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` file is causing a `TypeError` when calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `dtype='Int64'`. The issue on GitHub highlights this problem and provides a clear example of the error.

### Error Location:
The error likely occurs when trying to aggregate the values using the `grouper.aggregate` method. Specifically, the code assumes that the result of aggregation will not be a `DataFrame`, leading to a `TypeError` when attempting to cast the result back to the original dtype.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect handling of the result of aggregation in `_cython_agg_blocks`. When the result of aggregation is not what is expected, it leads to type errors and incorrect processing of the data, resulting in unexpected behavior when calling functions like `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the result of aggregation is correctly handled and cast back to the original dtype without causing type errors. This involves adjusting the logic in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle different cases of aggregation results correctly.

### Corrected Version:
Based on the analysis, the bug can be fixed by updating the handling of aggregated results and ensuring proper casting to the original dtype. Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is not None:
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                    obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                try:
                    result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                except TypeError:
                    continue
                else:
                    result = cast(np.ndarray, maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype))
        
        if result is not no_result and not isinstance(result, pd.DataFrame):        
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    for idx, blk in enumerate(agg_blocks):
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer.sum() + idx

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, the handling of the `result` during aggregation has been improved to avoid type errors and ensure correct casting back to the original dtype. This should address the issue reported on GitHub related to calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `dtype='Int64'`.
