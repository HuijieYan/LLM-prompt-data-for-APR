### Analysis:
The issue reported on GitHub relates to an error when calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` dtype data. The GitHub issue provides a clear description of the problem and the expected output. The bug seems to stem from the `_cython_agg_blocks` function within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class.

### Identified Bug:
The bug seems to occur when trying to aggregate data based on dtype, especially involving numeric types. The issue might arise due to how the data is handled and processed within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. It seems to have problems with the nullable integer data type `Int64` while aggregating.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by a discrepancy in handling nullable integer data types (e.g., `Int64`) within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, resulting in a `TypeError` when trying to perform aggregations like `mean`. The function may not be handling these specific data types correctly, leading to the error reported in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_cython_agg_blocks` function can correctly handle the nullable integer `Int64` data type while performing aggregations. It may involve ensuring that the data processing and aggregation logic gracefully handle nullable integer types.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to address the bug:
```python
    def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
        no_result = object()
        for block in data.blocks:
            result = no_result
            locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
            try:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
            except NotImplementedError:
                raise NotImplementedError("Aggregation method not supported")
    
            if result is not no_result:
                agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
                new_items.append(locs)
                agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
    
        if not agg_blocks:
            raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
    
        for blk in agg_blocks:
            loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
            blk.mgr_locs = np.concatenate(new_items)
    
        agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(np.concatenate(new_items)))
    
        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```  

You can replace the buggy `_cython_agg_blocks` function with this corrected version in the pandas source code to address the issue reported on GitHub. This corrected version should handle nullable integer types like `Int64` correctly while performing aggregations like `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object.
