### Analysis:
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class seems to have an issue with handling nullable integer data types, as reported in the GitHub issue. The problem arises when calling `mean` after grouping in the DataFrameGroupBy with `Int64` dtype, leading to a `TypeError`.

### Error Location:
The error likely stems from the section of the function where it tries to perform aggregation based on the data type of the blocks. The implementation in the current function might not be handling nullable integer data types properly.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the way the function `_cython_agg_blocks` processes the nullable integer data types during aggregation. It seems that the function is not properly handling nullable integers when applying aggregation operations, such as mean, which leads to a TypeError.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function `_cython_agg_blocks` needs to be modified to properly handle nullable integer data types during aggregation. Specifically, it needs to handle the `Int64` dtype correctly and ensure that aggregation operations like mean can be applied seamlessly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array

        if block.dtype.kind == 'i' and pd.api.types.is_nullable(block.dtype):
            block = block.fillna(0)  # Fill NaN values with zero for nullable integer
        elif block.dtype.kind == 'i':
            block = block.astype(np.float64)  # Convert integer dtype to float for mean aggregation

        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            deleted_items.append(locs)
            continue

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset locs in the blocks to correspond to current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    # Remaining code unchanged...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version includes handling for nullable integer data types where NaN values are filled with zeros before aggregation. Additionally, integer data types are converted to float for mean calculation, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub report.
