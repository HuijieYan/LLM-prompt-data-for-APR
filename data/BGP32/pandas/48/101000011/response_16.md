### Analysis:
The issue reported on GitHub mentions that calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype results in a `TypeError`. The error does not occur when calling `min`, `max`, or `first`, but does occur with `median` and `std`.

### Bug Location:
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is responsible for handling aggregation operations like `mean`, `median`, `min`, `max`, etc. It processes the data blocks and applies the aggregation function based on the parameters provided. The issue seems to arise from the handling of `Int64` dtype specifically in the aggregation process.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by the implementation of `_cython_agg_blocks` not fully supporting the new nullable integer data type `Int64`. The handling of `Int64` columns during the aggregation operation is not correct, leading to a `TypeError` when the `mean` function is used.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function needs to be updated to properly handle nullable integer data types like `Int64`. Specifically, when performing aggregation operations like `mean` on columns with `Int64` dtype, the function should handle these cases correctly to avoid any `TypeError` that may occur due to the mismatch in data types.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function with the fix for the `TypeError` issue related to `Int64` dtype:

```python
    def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":

        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

        if numeric_only:
            data = data.convert(numeric=True)

        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

        no_result = object()
        for block in data.blocks:
            result = no_result
            locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
            # Handle the aggregation correctly based on the datatype
            if block.dtype == 'int64' or block.dtype == 'Int64':
                # Perform appropriate actions for Int64 dtype during aggregation
                result = block.values.mean(0).reshape(1, -1)
            else:
                # Handle other data types normally
                try:
                    result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                        block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                    )
                except NotImplementedError:
                    if alt is None:
                        assert how == "ohlc"
                        deleted_items.append(locs)
                        continue
            
                    obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                    if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                        obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]
                    s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                    try:
                        result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                    except TypeError:
                        deleted_items.append(locs)
                        continue
                    else:
                        result = cast(DataFrame, result)
                        if len(result._data.blocks) != 1:
                            split_items.append(locs)
                            split_frames.append(result)
                            continue
                        
                        assert len(result._data.blocks) == 1
                        result = result._data.blocks[0].values
                        if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
                            result = result.reshape(1, -1)
            
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

        if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
            raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

        # The rest of the function remains unchanged...

        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version should address the issue reported on GitHub related to calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype resulting in a `TypeError`.
