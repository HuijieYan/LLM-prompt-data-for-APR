### Analysis:
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class seems to have an issue related to numeric operations on data blocks resulting in a `TypeError` when grouping by an `Int64` dtype column and calling `mean`. This bug aligns with the reported GitHub issue, indicating a problem when using the new nullable integer data type.

### Error Location:
The issue is most likely related to the handling of data transformation within the function `_cython_agg_blocks` when numeric operations are applied to the data blocks.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to inconsistencies in handling the `Int64` data type, particularly during the aggregation process. It seems the code is not fully compatible with the new nullable integer data type, resulting in a `TypeError` when using aggregation functions like `mean`.

### Fixing Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the data is handled properly, especially when dealing with the `Int64` data type. By modifying the way numeric operations are applied and results are processed, we can make the function compatible with the new nullable integer data type.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        
        if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            result_values = result.values  # Extract values from DataFrame
        else:
            result_values = result
        
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result_values)
        
        new_items.append(agg_block.mgr_locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
    
    # Reorder blocks based on aggregation
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)
    
    # Reset locs to current ordering
    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc
    
    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
    
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version addresses the problem by ensuring that the result from the aggregation is handled correctly, particularly regarding the `Int64` data type. It extracts the values from a DataFrame if the result is a DataFrame and properly constructs the `agg_block` using these values. Additionally, it reorders the blocks based on the aggregation results to maintain consistency.

This corrected function should resolve the `TypeError` related to calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with an `Int64` dtype, as reported in the GitHub issue.
