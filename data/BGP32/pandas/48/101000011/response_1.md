## Analyzing the buggy function and the related GitHub issue

The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is a crucial part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in Pandas, responsible for aggregating data after a group by operation. The bug reported in the GitHub issue indicates that calling the `mean()` function on a DataFrameGroupBy object with Int64 dtype columns results in a TypeError. This bug is specifically related to the nullable integer data type.

The bug seems to manifest when performing the aggregation with certain functions like `mean`, `median`, and `std`, but not with functions like `min`, `max`, or `first`. This suggests that there might be an issue when the operations involve floating-point calculations which are common for mean, median, and standard deviation.

## Identifying potential error locations

By inspecting the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, the potential error locations where the bug might be occurring are:
1. Processing the result of aggregation using `mean`, `median`, or `std`.
2. Handling nullable integer data type during aggregation.
3. Correctly casting data types when performing aggregation.

## Fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper handling of nullable integer data type and the aggregation results when using functions like `mean`, `median`, or `std`. Specifically, it's important to handle the special case of nullable integer data type during aggregation and make appropriate conversions to avoid the TypeError.

Below is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        
        # Correct handling of nullable integer data type during aggregation
        result = maybe_convert_objects(result)
        
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version includes the necessary conversion of aggregation results to handle nullable integer data types properly. By using `maybe_convert_objects`, we can ensure that the resultant data is correctly processed for functions like `mean`, `median`, and `std`. This fix should address the TypeError reported in the GitHub issue when performing aggregations with nullable integer columns.
