## Analysis:
The bug is related to calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with the `Int64` data type. The issue arises due to the aggregation process within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class.

## Identified potential errors:
1. The handling of blocks with data of object dtype could lead to unexpected behavior.
2. Failure to properly aggregate data when using an alternative method (`alt`) or encountering a `NotImplementedError`.
3. Incorrect casting and handling of blocks with Extension dtype.
4. Inadequate handling of the resulting blocks processing during aggregation.
5. Indexer adjustments for deleted blocks might not be correctly calculated.

## Explanation of the bug:
The bug occurs due to the handling of different block types, incorrect aggregation method selection, and handling of object dtype blocks. When calling `mean` on `Int64` data type within `groupby`, it triggers a series of operations within `_cython_agg_blocks` that can lead to the TypeError reported in the GitHub issue. The bug lies in the aggregation process within the function that incorrectly processes different block types, leading to unexpected results.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Properly handle the aggregation of object dtype within the blocks.
2. Enhance error handling for `NotImplementedError` and alternative aggregation method (`alt`).
3. Improve casting and handling for blocks with Extension dtype.
4. Implement correct processing and handling for resulting blocks during aggregation.
5. Ensure accurate adjustments for deleted blocks in the indexer calculation.

## Corrected Version:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is not None:
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                    obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                try:
                    result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                except TypeError:
                    deleted_items.append(locs)
                    continue
        except TypeError:
            deleted_items.append(locs)
            continue

        if not isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexing = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexing))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexing[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version aims to address the issues mentioned above in the identified potential errors. By handling data blocks more appropriately and improving error handling, this version should be able to resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue related to calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with the `Int64` data type.
