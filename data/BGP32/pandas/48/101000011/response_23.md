## Analysis:
- The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is from the `DataFrameGroupBy` class, which inherits from `GroupBy`.
- The issue reported on GitHub is related to calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with Int64 dtype resulting in a TypeError.
- The error does not occur when calling `min`, `max`, or `first`, but does occur with `median` and `std`.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The handling of numeric data may be causing the error when trying to aggregate.
2. Casting back the block to the original dtype might cause the issue.
3. Splitting object-dtype blocks into `List[Block[T], Block[U]]` could lead to errors.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug may be caused by the interactions between the handling of nullable integer data type (Int64) and the aggregation logic in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. Casting and splitting blocks may not be dealing correctly with the nullable integer data type, resulting in a TypeError when calling `mean`.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the aggregation logic handles nullable integer data type correctly. This might involve adjusting the handling of data types, avoiding unnecessary splitting of blocks, and ensuring compatibility with nullable integer data when performing aggregation.

## Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    try:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(data, how, axis=self.axis, min_count=min_count)
    except NotImplementedError:
        result = None

    if result is not None:
        for i, block in enumerate(data.blocks):
            agg_block = block.make_block(result[i])
            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    for i, blk in enumerate(agg_blocks):
        blk.mgr_locs = np.array(agg_items[i])
    
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version simplifies the aggregation process, ensuring compatibility with nullable integer data type and reducing unnecessary operations that could lead to a TypeError.
