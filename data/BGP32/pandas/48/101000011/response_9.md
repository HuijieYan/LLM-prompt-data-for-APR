### Analysis and Explanation:
After going through the provided buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks`, as well as the related issue on GitHub "calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype results in TypeError", we can identify the following potential issues leading to the bug:
1. The error occurs when calling mean after grouping on a nullable integer data type (`Int64`), resulting in a TypeError.
2. The behavior is inconsistent as it works with `int64` dtype or when taking a single column to get a `SeriesGroupBy`.
3. The bug seems to be related to handling numeric aggregation with nullable integers.
4. The issue mentioned that the error does not occur when calling `min`, `max`, or `first`, but occurs with `median` and `std`.
5. The expected output is not achieved due to the bug.

### Bug Fixing Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the handling of numeric aggregation is consistent and correctly handles nullable integer data types (`Int64`). The bug may stem from handling the aggregation process for nullable integer data. We need to account for this data type when calculating `mean`, `median`, `std`, etc.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function with the bug fixed based on the identified potential issues and related GitHub problem:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Handle nullable integer type for aggregation
            if (
                (how in ["mean", "median", "std"])
                and block.maybe_convert_integer_na()
            ):
                result = self._extended_agg_result_na(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
            # Handle other cases with a different approach
            else:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

        if result is not no_result:
            # Handle nullable integer type result
            if result.dtype == "Int64":
                result = result.astype(float)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Returning aggregated blocks and items
    return agg_blocks, data.items
```

In this corrected version, we added a specific handling for nullable integer data types (`Int64`) when aggregating with mean, median, and std. This modification should fix the issue reported on GitHub related to calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with nullable integer data types.
