## Analysis
The issue reported on GitHub relates to calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy object with `Int64` dtype columns, resulting in a TypeError. The bug is correlated with calling aggregation functions on DataFrameGroupBy objects that are not properly handling the nullable integer data type (`Int64`). The current implementation's bug resides in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class.

## Error Locations
1. In the `@pin_whitelisted_properties` decorator, the `DataFrameGroupBy` class is marked to use whitelisted properties.
2. The `DataFrameGroupBy` class defines an `_cython_agg_blocks` function that contains the buggy logic related to aggregation operations on `BlockManager` objects.
3. The issue arises during the aggregation process for numeric columns within `Block` objects.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs due to a lack of proper handling for numeric data types, particularly the `Int64` dtype when performing aggregation operations in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. This leads to a TypeError when calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy with columns of type `Int64`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug and address the issue reported, we need to ensure that the `_cython_agg_blocks` function properly handles nullable integer data types such as `Int64` during aggregation. This involves modifying the logic inside the function to correctly aggregate numeric values, especially when dealing with nullable integer data types.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = pd.DataFrame()
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        
        if hasattr(block.dtype, 'new'):
            result = block.values.astype('float64')
        else:
            result = block.values

        result = self.grouper.aggregate(result, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
    
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version, we have added proper handling for nullable integer data types (`Int64`) within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. This fix should address the issue described in the GitHub report when calling aggregation functions on DataFrameGroupBy objects with `Int64` columns.
