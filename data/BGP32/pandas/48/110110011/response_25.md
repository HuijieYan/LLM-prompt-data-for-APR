## Analysis:
- The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class deals with aggregating data blocks, but it has an issue when dealing with nullable integer data types.
- The test function `test_apply_to_nullable_integer_returns_float` invokes various aggregation functions on nullable integer data, leading to a `TypeError` when performing certain operations like `mean`, `median`, or `var`. This error arises due to the inability to safely cast non-equivalent float64 data to int64.
- The GitHub issue highlights a specific scenario where calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype results in a `TypeError`, showcasing the real-world impact of this bug.

## Bug Cause:
- The bug arises from the function `_cython_agg_blocks` incorrectly handling nullable integer data types when performing aggregation operations like `mean`, `median`, or `var`.
- The error message indicates a failure when attempting to cast float64 data to int64, leading to data type mismatch and resulting in a `TypeError`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper handling of nullable integer data types during aggregation operations in `_cython_agg_blocks`.
- Specifically, we need to address the casting issue when encountering float64 data types in the aggregation process.

## Corrected Version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.convert(numeric_only=True)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        mgr_locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, min_count=min_count)
        
        agg_block_dtype = result.dtype
        if agg_block_dtype.kind == 'f' and block.dtype.kind == 'i':
            result = result.astype(block.dtype)  # Safely cast float to int

        agg_block = make_block(result, placement=mgr_locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    return agg_blocks, data.items
```

By making the corrections as shown above, we address the data type conversion issue when aggregating nullable integer data, ensuring compatibility and resolving the `TypeError` that occurred during the aggregation process.
