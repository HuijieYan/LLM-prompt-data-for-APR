### Analysis:
- The `DataFrameGroupBy` class inherits from `GroupBy` and contains the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.
- The issue reported on GitHub mentions that calling mean, median, var on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype results in a `TypeError`.
- The failing test is using the mean, median, and var functions on a grouped DataFrame with Int64 dtype columns, resulting in a TypeError related to casting from float64 to int64.
- The error message points to the `safe_cast` function in `pandas/core/arrays/integer.py`, indicating the failure in casting float64 to int64.
- The reported error matches with the reported GitHub issue related to calling mean on a grouped DataFrame with `Int64` dtype.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `DataFrameGroupBy` class attempting to cast float64 values to int64 when calculating mean, median, or var, resulting in a TypeError due to non-equivalent data types.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle the casting of float64 to Int64 appropriately. We need to ensure that the casting is done safely without causing a TypeError.

### Corrected Version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.get_values(copy=False), how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        if alt is not None and isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            result = result.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
    
    agg_items = data.items
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

Applying this fix should resolve the casting issue and ensure that the mean, median, and var functions work correctly on grouped DataFrames with `Int64` dtype columns.
