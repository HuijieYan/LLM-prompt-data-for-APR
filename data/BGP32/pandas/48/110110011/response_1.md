### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class from `pandas.core.groupby.generic` is causing a `TypeError` when trying to cast values from `float64` to `int64` while aggregating.
2. The error message indicates that it cannot safely cast non-equivalent types.
3. The corresponding GitHub issue points out the problem of calling `mean` on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype resulting in a `TypeError`.
4. The cause of the bug seems to be related to the casting issue between float and int types during aggregation operations in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

### Bug Cause:
The error occurs in the function `_cython_agg_blocks` due to the attempt to cast `float64` to `int64` when aggregating numeric values. This is triggered by operations like `mean`, `median`, or `var` on nullable integers.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, you can ensure that the aggregation operations in `_cython_agg_blocks` handle the casting between float and int types correctly to avoid the `TypeError`. Consider converting the aggregated values to the appropriate dtype before assigning them to the aggregated blocks.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function that should resolve the casting issue:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        agg_block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset the locs in the blocks
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By updating the aggregation logic to handle the casting correctly, the corrected function should resolve the `TypeError` issue.
