### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is located in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` file. It is responsible for aggregating data within a DataFrameGroupBy object.
- The issue is related to casting from float64 to int64 when calling functions like mean, median, or var on a DataFrameGroupBy object with Int64 dtype.
- The failing test is trying to apply these aggregation functions to nullable integers and is resulting in a TypeError due to unsafe casting between float64 and int64.
- The reported GitHub issue describes a similar problem when calling `mean` on nullable integers in a grouped DataFrame.
  
### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the `_from_sequence` method is used to cast the result of the aggregation back to the original data type. The `astype` operation on float64 to int64 is not safe with the rule 'safe', leading to a TypeError.

### Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to handle the safe casting of data between float64 and int64 when aggregating the data in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.
- The solution involves ensuring that the casting operation is safe and that the result dtype matches the original dtype where necessary.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Existing code remains unchanged

        assert not isinstance(result, DataFrame)

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result, axis=block._asarray_transposed.minor_axis)
            
            if block.dtype.name == "Int64":
                if result.dtype == np.int64:
                    result = result.astype(np.int64, copy=False)
                else:
                    raise TypeError(f"Cannot safely cast {result.dtype} to dtype('Int64')")

            agg_block = block.make_block(result)

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    return agg_blocks, data.items
```

By utilizing the `maybe_convert_objects` function and explicitly handling the casting when dealing with nullable integers, we ensure a safe conversion between float64 and int64 types during aggregation.
