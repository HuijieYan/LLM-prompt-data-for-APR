### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the `pandas` library is causing a type casting error when calculating aggregate functions like mean, median, or var on nullable integer data.
- The failing test code demonstrates the issue where calling mean or median on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` dtype results in a type casting error.
- The error message indicates that it is not possible to cast non-equivalent `float64` values to `int64` safely.
- The GitHub issue further confirms the problem with calling mean on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with nullable integer data type.
  
### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the type casting operation happening within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function when computing the aggregate results.
- When the result of the aggregation is a `float`, it is not being handled correctly to be cast back to an `Int64` dtype, leading to the type casting error.

### Fix Strategy:
- We need to handle the case where the result of the aggregation is a float and correctly convert it back to `Int64` dtype to avoid the type casting error.
- We should modify the code to handle these scenarios properly to ensure that the results can be safely cast without causing any errors.

### Correction:
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function that addresses the type casting issue:

```python
    def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

        for block in data.blocks:
            values = block.values
            result = self.grouper.aggregate(values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

            if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
                result = result.to_numpy()

            if result.dtype == np.float64 and block.dtype.name == 'Int64':
                result = np.round(result).astype('Int64')

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

        if not (agg_blocks):
            raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

        # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
        indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
        agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

        for i, blk in enumerate(agg_blocks):
            blk.mgr_locs = np.array(indexer)
            indexer += 1

        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By rounding the `float` results and then casting them back to `Int64` dtype when needed, we ensure that the type casting is done safely without causing any errors. This correction should resolve the issue with type casting when performing aggregations on nullable integer data.
