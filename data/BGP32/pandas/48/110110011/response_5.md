### Bug Analysis:
- The bug occurs when calling the `mean`, `median`, or `var` functions on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` dtype data.
- The error message indicates a `TypeError` when trying to cast from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64'). This error arises from the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.
- The issue has been reported on GitHub as calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype resulting in a `TypeError`.

### Bug Location:
- The bug is in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class.
- The error happens when trying to perform the aggregation and cast the result back to the original dtype.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by incorrectly handling the casting back to the original dtype after aggregation.
- The function fails to properly cast values from float64 to int64, leading to the error.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- When casting values back after aggregation, ensure that the casting is done correctly to avoid type errors.
- Handle the case when the result needs to be cast back to `Int64` dtype.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    agg_items = np.concatenate(new_items)
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

### Note:
- The corrected code simplifies the aggregation process and avoids the dtype casting issue.
- After making this correction, the `mean`, `median`, and `var` functions should work correctly with `Int64` dtype data in a `DataFrameGroupBy` context.
