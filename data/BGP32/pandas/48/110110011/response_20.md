### Analysis:
#### Buggy Function:
The `_cython_agg_blocks` function in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class is causing the error when trying to calculate aggregate functions on nullable integer data types.

#### Error Location:
The error is occurring in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function when trying to convert float64 values to int64 values.

#### Reason for the Bug:
The bug is caused by the inability to safely cast float64 values to int64 values according to the 'safe' casting rule.

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the casting from float64 to int64 is performed correctly, taking into account the nullable integer data type.

### Correction:
```python
from collections.abc import Sequence
from pandas.core.dtypes.cast import maybe_convert_objects, maybe_numeric_to_object, maybe_downcast_to_dtype
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_float_dtype

def _cython_agg_blocks(self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data = self._get_data_to_aggregate(numeric_only=numeric_only)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items = []
    deleted_items = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        if result is not None:
            result, _ = result
            if is_float_dtype(result.dtype):
                result = maybe_numeric_to_object(result, dtype='Int64')
                result = maybe_convert_objects(result, copy=True)
                
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
    
    if not (agg_blocks):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
    
    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our
    # current ordering
    idx_order = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(idx_order))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.set_ref_locs(indexer=idx_order[offset : offset + loc])
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By ensuring correct conversion and casting between float64 and int64 types for nullable integer data, the corrected function should now handle the aggregation operations correctly.
