### Bug Analysis
- The bug occurs when calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with Int64 dtype.
- The error message indicates a `TypeError` related to casting between float64 and int64.
- The issue has been reported on GitHub with details about the problem and expected output.

### Potential Error Locations
1. The `_cython_agg_blocks` function might be incorrectly handling the conversion between float64 and int64.
2. The error could be related to the calculation of mean in the grouping operation.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by an incorrect handling of the types during the aggregation process in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. This leads to a TypeError when trying to cast non-equivalent types (float64 to int64).

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the casting between float64 and int64 is done correctly and handle the conversion appropriately in the aggregation process.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:
```python
    def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
        for block in data.blocks:
            # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
            result = None
            locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
            try:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
            except NotImplementedError:
                if alt is None:
                    deleted_items.append(locs)
                    continue
    
                obj = self.obj[locs]
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0] if obj.shape[1] == 1 else obj
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                try:
                    result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                except TypeError:
                    deleted_items.append(locs)
                    continue
    
            if result is not None:
                agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
                new_items.append(locs)
                agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
    
        if not agg_blocks:
            raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
    
        indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
        agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))
    
        offset = 0
        for blk in agg_blocks:
            loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
            blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : offset + loc]
            offset += loc
    
        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By adjusting the casting and handling of values within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, the bug related to calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with Int64 dtype should be resolved.
