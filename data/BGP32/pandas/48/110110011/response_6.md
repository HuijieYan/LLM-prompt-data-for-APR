### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the file `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` is causing errors in the test cases `test_apply_to_nullable_integer_returns_float`.
- The error message is related to a `TypeError` occurring while trying to cast a `float64` array to an `int64`.
- The GitHub issue describes a similar problem where calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype results in a `TypeError`.
- The root cause seems to be related to the handling of nullable integer data types during aggregation operations.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug arises when trying to cast a `float64` result to an `Int64` dtype.
- The problematic line is likely where the result is being converted back to the original dtype after computing the aggregated values, which results in a `dtype` mismatch.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the casting logic to handle the conversion from `float64` to `Int64` dtype correctly.
- Ensure that the result is correctly converted without causing a `TypeError`.
- Handle the nullable integer data types appropriately during aggregation operations.

### Corrected Version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.dtype == np.float64:
            result = result.astype(np.int64)

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version ensures that any result obtained after aggregation is correctly cast to an `Int64` dtype if it was originally of type `float64`, avoiding the `TypeError` that occurred during the conversion.

By making this modification, the function should now handle the aggregation correctly for nullable integer data types and pass the failing test cases.
