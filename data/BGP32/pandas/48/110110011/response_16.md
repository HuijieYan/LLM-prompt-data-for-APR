### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is supposed to handle aggregation blocks in a DataFrameGroupBy object.
- The error message indicates a `TypeError` when trying to cast from float64 to int64.
- The failing test is related to applying functions like `mean`, `median`, `var` on a DataFrameGroupBy object with nullable integer data type.
- The GitHub issue also highlights the problem with calling `mean` after grouping with the Int64 data type.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug arises from the `_cython_agg_blocks` function failing to handle the safe casting of non-equivalent values when performing aggregation functions like mean, median, var on nullable integer data types. This results in a TypeError due to the incorrect casting from float64 to int64.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To address the bug, we need to ensure that the safe casting from float64 to int64 is handled correctly within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function when performing aggregation operations on nullable integer data types.

### Corrected Version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )
        
        # Handle safe casting for nullable integer types
        if str(block.dtype) == 'Int64' and isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.dtype == 'float64':
            result = result.round().astype('Int64')

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs)

        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Update the indexer based on the new items
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    for i, blk in enumerate(agg_blocks):
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[len(data.blocks[i].mgr_locs): len(data.blocks[i+1].mgr_locs)]

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

### Summary:
- The corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function now ensures the safe casting of non-equivalent values for nullable integer data types when performing aggregation operations like `mean`, `median`, `var`.
- Updating the casting logic inside this function resolves the `TypeError` when calling aggregation functions on nullable integer data types, as observed in the failing test cases and the GitHub issue.
