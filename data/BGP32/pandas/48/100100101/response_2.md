The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` fails to handle the aggregation process correctly, leading to unexpected results and failing test cases. The main issue lies in how it handles the aggregation of numeric data when using functions like mean, median, and variance.

Here is the bug analysis and suggested correction strategy:

### Bug Analysis:
1. The function fails to correctly aggregate the numeric data for the provided test cases.
2. It generates incorrect results when trying to compute mean, median, and variance.
3. It is not correctly managing the data blocks and aggregation process.

### Correction Strategy:
1. Ensure that the aggregation process considers the numeric data only.
2. Properly handle the aggregation operations for mean, median, and var based on the input data.
3. Update the variables used in the aggregation process to maintain correct results.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = block.aggregate(how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        agg_block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : offset + loc]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By updating the aggregation process and handling numeric data correctly, the corrected function should now produce the expected results and pass the failing test cases.
