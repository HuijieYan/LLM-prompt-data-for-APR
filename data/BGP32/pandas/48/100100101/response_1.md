The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` has an issue where it fails to return the correct results. The expected output values are not being generated properly, leading to test failures. The main problem lies in the calculation and assignment of the `agg_block` variable.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        if result is None:
            continue

        result = maybe_convert_objects(result)
        result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

        if block.is_extension:
            result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, block.dtype)

        agg_block: Block = make_block(result, placement=block.mgr_locs)

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version:
- The function now correctly performs the aggregation and assignment of the `agg_block` variable.
- It handles cases where the `result` may be None and correctly downcasts the result to match the block's dtype.
- The function now returns the `agg_blocks` and `agg_items` as expected.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases.
