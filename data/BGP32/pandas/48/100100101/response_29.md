### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function seems to be related to the aggregation logic that is causing incorrect results in certain cases when aggregating blocks. The issue is likely occurring due to improper handling of the aggregation result for specific functions like 'mean', 'median', and 'var'.

1. In the failing test cases, the expected output for aggregation results is known. For example, when the function is called with 'mean', the result should be `1.5` for each group. Similarly, for 'median' and 'var', the expected values are known.

2. Looking at the buggy function, there are multiple places where the aggregation computation is performed and results are processed. The bug might be related to how these results are handled, cast, or transformed during the aggregation process.

3. The bug could be causing incorrect results to be stored in the `agg_blocks` list, leading to failing the comparison with the expected output in the tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, we need to ensure proper aggregation results handling, transformation, and storage. Here are some strategies to address the bug:

1. Check the aggregation result computations for 'mean', 'median', and 'var' functions. Ensure that the calculations are correct and the results are stored appropriately.

2. Verify the transformation of the aggregation results to the expected dtype and shape. Make sure that the conversion is compatible with downstream processing.

3. Inspect the logic for populating `agg_blocks` list and how the blocks are created and stored. Ensure that the blocks created are in line with the expected output format.

4. Address any issues related to handling split blocks, deleted items, or special cases like handling 'var' separately.

### Bug-Fixed Version of `_cython_agg_blocks`

```python
# Fix the buggy function _cython_agg_blocks
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = None
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            deleted_items.append(locs)
            continue
        
        if result is not None:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or deleted_items):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))
    
    # Adjust the indexer to account for the items removed
    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By ensuring correct handling and transformation of aggregation results in the function, the bug should be resolved. The corrected version of the function is now expected to pass the failing test cases and produce the correct output.
