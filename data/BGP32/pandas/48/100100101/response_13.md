Looking at the buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks`, the potential bug lies in the computation of the result and the aggregation process within the loop. The function is intended to aggregate blocks of data based on the specified operation (how: mean, median, var). However, due to incorrect handling of the result and management of block data, the function fails to produce the expected output.

The bug leads to incorrect aggregation results being appended to `agg_blocks`. It also affects the handling of items, resulting in unexpected behavior in the function. The key issue seems to be related to the logic for creating and managing the aggregation results and their blocks within the loop.

To fix this bug, we should ensure that the aggregation results are correctly processed and added to the `agg_blocks` list. We also need to ensure that items are appropriately handled while aggregating the data blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array

        if len(locs) == 0:  # Skip empty blocks
            continue

        if alt is not None:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
            if result is not None:
                result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
                agg_block = block.make_block(result)
                new_items.append(locs)
                agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if len(agg_blocks) == 0:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : offset + loc]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version improves the mechanism for aggregating blocks and handling results. It ensures correct aggregation and appropriate handling of the items for the final output.

By implementing these changes, the corrected function should now produce the expected results and pass the provided test cases.
