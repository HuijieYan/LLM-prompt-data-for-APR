After analyzing the buggy function, the issue seems to be related to how the `agg_block` is created and appended to the `agg_blocks` list. The function fails to correctly handle the aggregation result and cast it back to the original dtype of the block.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the result is appropriately cast back to the original dtype of the block. Specifically, we need to handle the case where the result is an ndarray and the block is an extension block.

Below is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

        if hasattr(result, "__len__") and len(result) == 2:
            result, _ = result

        result = maybe_convert_objects(result)

        if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
            result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, block.dtype)

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version ensures that the result is correctly cast back to the original dtype of the block, handling the case where the result is an ndarray and the block is an extension block.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
