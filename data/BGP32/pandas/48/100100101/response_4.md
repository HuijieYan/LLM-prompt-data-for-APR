The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` has issues when trying to aggregate data with the specified method ('mean', 'median', 'var') due to incorrect handling of the result and block data. The function should correctly aggregate data blocks and generate new aggregates.

The main issue lies in the handling of the result and dtype casting of the aggregated values. The incorrect casting is causing the function to fail to produce the expected output.

To fix the bug, we need to update the section of the function where the result is processed and cast to the desired dtype. We should also ensure that the aggregation and block creation process is accurate.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        
        # Downcast the result to the original dtype of the block
        casted_result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

        # Create a new Block with the aggregated result
        agg_block: Block = make_block(casted_result, ndim=2, placement=block.mgr_locs)

        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = BlockPlacement(slice(offset, offset + loc, 1))
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version should now correctly aggregate the data blocks based on the specified method and handle the Dtype casting appropriately. It should pass the failing tests and produce the expected output for each test case provided.
