The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` has an issue with the splitting of object-dtype blocks when applying certain aggregation functions. The bug results in incorrect splitting and combining of blocks, leading to unexpected output.

The main issue arises when the function encounters an `UnsupportedFunctionError` while trying to aggregate data, resulting in splitting of the block. The splitting logic is flawed, leading to incorrect handling of the blocks and resulting in the wrong output.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic for splitting and combining blocks to ensure the correct handling of data during aggregation.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # Get the data to aggregate
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array

        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is not None:
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                result = s.agg(alt)

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
                result = result.reshape(1, -1)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : offset + loc]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

With this correction, the function should now split and combine blocks correctly, resolving the issue with aggregation and providing the expected output for the test cases.
