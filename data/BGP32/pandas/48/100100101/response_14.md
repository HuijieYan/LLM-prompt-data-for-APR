The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is not handling the aggregation of blocks correctly, which leads to incorrect results and failing tests. The function has a logical error in how it processes the aggregated results and the creation of new blocks.

The key issue lies in the creation of `agg_block`, where it is being appended to `agg_blocks` before correctly processing and creating the block. This results in adding blocks with incorrect values to the list.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the creation and processing of the aggregated blocks are done correctly before adding them to the final `agg_blocks` list.

Below is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            deleted_items.append(locs)
            continue

        if not isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            if result is not None:
                result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    if split_items:
        for locs, result in zip(split_items, split_frames):
            assert len(locs) == result.shape[1]
            for i, loc in enumerate(locs):
                new_items.append(np.array([loc], dtype=locs.dtype))
                agg_blocks.append(result.iloc[:, [i]]._data.blocks[0])

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version ensures that the aggregation results are correctly processed and added to the `agg_blocks` list before returning the final aggregated blocks. This should fix the failing tests and produce the expected output values for all test cases.
