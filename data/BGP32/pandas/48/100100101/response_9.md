The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` has an issue related to the handling of numeric data and data aggregation. The bug causes incorrect aggregation results when computing mean, median, or variance of grouped data.

The bug is due to how the function is handling split data blocks and the resulting DataFrame objects within the `try` block. The logic for split blocks is not correctly handling the DataFrame result, leading to incorrect aggregation results.

To fix the bug:
1. Properly handle the case when a DataFrame result is split as part of the aggregation process.
2. Ensure that the aggregation results are correctly cast and reshaped as needed for further processing.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = None

        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[block.mgr_locs]]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)

            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                continue

        if result is not None:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(np.array([idx], dtype=block.mgr_locs.as_array.dtype))
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # rearrange the blocks
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : offset + loc]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By making these changes, the corrected function should now handle the split blocks and DataFrame results correctly, ensuring that the aggregation results are accurate. This updated version should pass the failing test cases provided.
