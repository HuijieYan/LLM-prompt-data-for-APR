### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is caused by the `result` variable being assigned incorrectly within the loop. The return value from the `self.grouper.aggregate` call is not checked properly, leading to the incorrect assignment of `result`. This causes unexpected behavior and errors in the subsequent parts of the function.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the handling of the `result` variable is correct at every step in the loop. We should properly check for the condition where `result` is not equal to `no_result` and handle that scenario accordingly.

### Updated and Corrected Function
Below is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)

            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

### Summary
The corrected function now properly handles the assignment of the `result` variable within the loop, ensuring that the correct data processing and aggregation occur. This should fix the bug and allow the function to pass the failing test cases.
