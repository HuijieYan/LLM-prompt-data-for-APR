1. The buggy function is `quantile` in the `pandas/core/frame.py` file.
2. The error message states that there is a `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate` occurring within the `quantile` function when trying to concatenate arrays.
3. The cause of the bug is that the function is attempting to concatenate arrays (`blocks`) without ensuring that there is at least one array present, resulting in the `ValueError`.
4. In order to fix the bug, we need to check if there are any blocks present before attempting to concatenate them. We also need to handle the case when there are no blocks to concatenate.
5. Here is the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if len(result) == 0:  # Check if there are no blocks to concatenate
        return self._constructor_empty(data)

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

With the updated implementation, we are now checking if `result` has any blocks to concatenate, and if not, we return an empty constructor. This modification should resolve the `ValueError` encountered in the original buggy function.
