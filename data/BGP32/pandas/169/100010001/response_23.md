### Analysis:
- The error message indicates a `ValueError` with the message "need at least one array to concatenate" in the `concat_compat` function in the `pandas/core/dtypes/concat.py` file.
- The error is likely occurring during a concatenation operation where empty arrays are being attempted to be concatenated.

### Bug:
- The bug seems to stem from the creation of an empty DataFrame `df` and passing it through the `quantile` function without any columns specified.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- We should check if the DataFrame has any columns before proceeding with the quantile calculation.
- If the DataFrame is empty, we should handle this case gracefully, maybe by providing a default value or raising an error indicating that at least one column is required for quantile calculation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Corrected version of the quantile function
    """
    if len(self.columns) == 0:  # Check if DataFrame has any columns
        raise ValueError("DataFrame must have at least one column for quantile calculation")
    
    self._check_percentile(q)
    
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

### By adding the column check at the beginning of the quantile function, we ensure that the function does not try to calculate quantiles when the DataFrame is empty. This correction should prevent the `ValueError` that was previously encountered in the failing test.
