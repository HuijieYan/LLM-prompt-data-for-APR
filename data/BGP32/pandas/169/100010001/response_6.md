### Bug Analysis:
The error message indicates a `ValueError` happening during the concatenation operation inside the `quantile` function. Specifically, the function is trying to concatenate arrays but is encountering an issue because there are no arrays to concatenate.

### Bug location:
The potential error locations within the `quantile` function are:
1. The `self._check_percentile(q)` function call at the beginning.
2. The assignment of the `data` variable based on whether `numeric_only` is `True` or `False`.
3. The operation to calculate the quantile, specifically `result = data._data.quantile(...)`.
4. Potential issues in transposing the data.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the `data` variable not being correctly assigned based on the value of `numeric_only`. This can lead to situations where no numeric data is available for calculation. This could result in empty arrays being passed for concatenation, causing the `ValueError` mentioned in the error message.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct data is used for calculation based on the `numeric_only` parameter. We need to validate the data before attempting any calculations, ensuring at least one array is available for concatenation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self.select_dtypes(include=[np.number]) if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    if data.empty:
        raise ValueError("No numeric data available for quantile calculation")

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

By selecting only numeric data when `numeric_only` is `True and adding a check for empty data before calculation, this corrected version should resolve the issue mentioned in the failing test.
