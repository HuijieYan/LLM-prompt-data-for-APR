Analysis:
The buggy function is the `quantile` method within the `DataFrame` class. The function calculates the quantile values for the given DataFrame. The issue arises from the fact that the function is defined twice in the class, which leads to ambiguity during function call.

Potential Error:
The error occurs because two identical functions `quantile` are declared in the `DataFrame` class.

Cause of the Bug:
The function is defined twice with the same name and same arguments. This leads to ambiguity and the wrong function might be called during execution.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, one of the `quantile` functions needs to be removed. We can keep the first `quantile` function declaration and remove the second one.

Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version after removing the duplicate `quantile` function declaration:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/frame.py

# The corrected class definition with the removed duplicate method
class DataFrame(NDFrame):
    def _constructor(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation='linear'):
        """
        Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.
        
        Complete function implementation as provided in the code snippet.

        Returns
        -------
        Series or DataFrame
        """
        self._check_percentile(q)
        
        data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
        axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
        is_transposed = axis == 1
        
        if is_transposed:
            data = data.T
        
        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
        )
        
        if result.ndim == 2:
            result = self._constructor(result)
        else:
            result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)
        
        if is_transposed:
            result = result.T
        
        return result
``` 

In the corrected version, the duplicate `quantile` function is removed, and the remaining `quantile` function is implemented with the necessary functionality. This should resolve the bug and prevent ambiguity during function calls.
