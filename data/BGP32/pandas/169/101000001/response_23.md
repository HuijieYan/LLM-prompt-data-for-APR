## Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The call to `self._check_percentile(q)` seems to be checking the percentile of `q`, rather than verifying if `q` is within the valid range of 0 to 1. This could lead to unexpected behavior.

2. The assignment of `data` based on `numeric_only` may not be functioning as intended, potentially impacting the computation of quantiles.

3. The usage of `axis` is not consistent, particularly when setting `is_transposed` based on the axis number.

4. The slicing of the result in `_constructor_sliced` might not be working correctly for certain cases, leading to incorrect outputs.

## Cause of the bug:
The buggy function has issues with handling the inputs `q`, `numeric_only`, and `axis` properly, potentially affecting the computation of quantiles and resulting in incorrect outputs. The inconsistency in handling `is_transposed` can also lead to unexpected behavior.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `_check_percentile(q)` call to validate that `q` is within the range [0, 1] instead of checking its percentile. This ensures that the input is appropriate for quantile computation.

2. Adjust the assignment of `data` based on `numeric_only` to accurately determine the data to be used for quantile calculation, ensuring correct results.

3. Maintain a consistent approach when dealing with `axis` and `is_transposed` to ensure proper handling of row-wise and column-wise quantile computations.

4. Review the slicing operation in `_constructor_sliced` to confirm that it slices the result accurately, preserving data integrity.

## Corrected Version of the function:
```python
    def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
        """
        Return values at the given quantile over the requested axis.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        q : float or array-like, default 0.5 (50% quantile)
            Value between 0 <= q <= 1, the quantile(s) to compute.
        axis : {0, 1, 'index', 'columns'} (default 0)
            Equals 0 or 'index' for row-wise, 1 or 'columns' for column-wise.
        numeric_only : bool, default True
            If False, the quantile of datetime and timedelta data will be computed as well.
        interpolation : {'linear', 'lower', 'higher', 'midpoint', 'nearest'}
            This optional parameter specifies the interpolation method to use,
            when the desired quantile lies between two data points `i` and `j`.

        Returns
        -------
        Series or DataFrame

            If ``q`` is an array, a DataFrame will be returned where the
              index is ``q``, the columns are the columns of self, and the
              values are the quantiles.
            If ``q`` is a float, a Series will be returned where the
              index is the columns of self and the values are the quantiles.
        """
        if not 0 <= q <= 1:
            raise ValueError("q should be between 0 and 1")

        data = self.select_dtypes(include=[np.number]) if numeric_only else self

        axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
        is_transposed = axis == 1

        if is_transposed:
            data = data.T

        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
        )

        if result.ndim == 2:
            result = self._constructor(result)
        else:
            result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

        if is_transposed:
            result = result.T

        return result
```
In the corrected version, the function now properly validates the range of `q`, selects the data based on `numeric_only`, and maintains consistency with `axis` handling. The modifications aim to fix the potential errors and improve the functionality of the quantile computation.
