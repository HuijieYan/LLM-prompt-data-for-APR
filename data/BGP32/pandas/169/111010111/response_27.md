Based on the analysis provided, the bug in the `DataFrame.quantile` function appears to be related to handling datetime data, causing a `ValueError` when trying to concatenate arrays. The issue arises when trying to concatenate empty arrays. To fix this, we need to ensure the function properly handles scenarios where there is no numeric data present.

To address the bug, we need to update the function to handle cases where there is no numeric data effectively. By checking for the presence of numeric data before operations that involve concatenation, we can prevent the `ValueError` from occurring. The updated function should account for empty cases where no numeric data is available.

Here is the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    
    if data.empty:
        return data
    
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This updated version incorporates a check for empty data frames before proceeding with operations that may lead to concatenation issues. By returning the empty data frame if there is no numeric data, we can prevent the `ValueError` from occurring in cases where concatenation is attempted without valid arrays.

Please test the corrected function with the expected input/output values provided to ensure that it resolves the bug identified in the GitHub issue.
