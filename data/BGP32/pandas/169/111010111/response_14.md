The bug in the `quantile` function is related to the manipulation of `data` based on whether `numeric_only` is true or false. When `numeric_only` is false, the `data` variable is not updated correctly before later operations. This leads to an issue with concatenation where no arrays are present for the operation, causing a `ValueError`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `data` variable is properly set to the full DataFrame when `numeric_only` is false so that further operations do not encounter issues with empty data. The corrected version of the function should handle this scenario and maintain the correct structure for further calculations.

Here is the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self if not numeric_only else self._get_numeric_data()
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In this corrected version, the `data` variable is assigned based on the `numeric_only` condition, ensuring that the full DataFrame is used when needed. This modification should resolve the issue with the concatenation error and align with the expected behavior of the `quantile` function.
