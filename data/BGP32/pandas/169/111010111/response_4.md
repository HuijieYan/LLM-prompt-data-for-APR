The bug in the given function `quantile` arises due to an issue in concatenating the results from an empty DataFrame when calculating quantiles for datetime data. The issue leads to a `ValueError` because an empty dataset is used for computation.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The initial check for date types in the function.
2. The creation and handling of the `data` variable, which might lead to an empty DataFrame.
3. The logic around whether the data is transposed or not.
4. The construction of the resulting DataFrame or Series.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is triggered when trying to calculate quantiles for datetime data in an empty DataFrame. The `_get_numeric_data()` function may result in an empty DataFrame without numeric data, causing incorrect concatenation of the results. This behavior conflicts with the expectation set in the GitHub issue, where quantile calculations for datetime data should work similarly to how they work for Series.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To resolve the bug, the internal handling of datetime data in an empty DataFrame needs to be addressed. A correction involves considering the datetime data and ensuring the quantile calculation operates correctly even when working with non-numeric data.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    # Check if there is any numeric data, or ensure datetime data is handled correctly
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only and not self.empty else self
    columns = self.columns

    if axis in self._AXIS_NAMES:
        axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)

    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T
        columns = self.index

    if data._is_empty:
        # Return an empty Series when there is no data available for quantile calculation
        result = pd.Series([], index=columns, name=q)
    else:
        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
        )

        if result.ndim == 2:
            result = self._constructor(result)
        else:
            result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

        if is_transposed:
            result = result.T

    return result
```

By improving the logic as shown above, the corrected `quantile` function handles the scenario where an empty DataFrame results from the data selection process. Additionally, the corrected function provides an empty Series when necessary, as indicated by the specific cases in the expected values and types. This fix addresses the concatenation issue encountered in the failing test case and aligns with the requirements set by the GitHub issue.
