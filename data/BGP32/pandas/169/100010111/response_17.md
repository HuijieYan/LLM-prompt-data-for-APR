### Analyze the buggy function and error message

The buggy function, `quantile`, is expected to return values at the given quantile over a requested axis using numerical data. The error message indicates a `ValueError` with the message "need at least one array to concatenate." The error occurs during concatenation when attempting to compute the quantile.

### Identify potential error locations
1. The data extraction using `_get_numeric_data()` might result in empty or null data.
2. The concatenation operation with `np.concatenate` seems to be the source of the issue.
3. Handling of transposed data might introduce anomalies in the concatenation process.

### Explain the bug's cause
The bug arises from the function trying to concatenate empty arrays without any validation. When `_get_numeric_data()` results in an empty DataFrame, the subsequent concatenation fails as there is no data to concatenate. This situation occurs because datetime data isn't considered numeric data and hence isn't part of the selected data for quantile computation.

### Suggested bug-fixing strategy
To resolve this bug, we need to ensure that the data passed for quantile computation is not empty. This can be achieved by validating the data before conducting any operations, ensuring that there is at least one array to concatenate.

### Corrected version of the function
Below is the corrected version with a validation step that checks if `data` is empty before proceeding with quantile computation:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data()
    if data.empty:
        raise ValueError("Numeric data is empty, cannot compute quantile.")

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected version ensures that an error is raised if the `_get_numeric_data()` method results in an empty DataFrame, preventing the invalid concatenation operation.
