### Analysis:
The buggy function `quantile` in `pandas/core/frame.py` is encountering the `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate`. The issue is related to the DataFrame quantile calculations with datetime data. Specifically, the bug occurs when a DataFrame with datetime data is processed, causing the inner block operations to fail and raise the error. 

The function is supposed to compute the quantiles for the given DataFrame along a certain axis, handling different data types based on `numeric_only` parameter. The bug is likely due to unintended behavior when operating on datetime data.

### Bug Location:
The bug is likely located in the block concatenation part of the function `quantile` which involves processing blocks of data inside the `BlockManager`. The error is triggered when attempting to concatenate arrays without checking for the presence of valid data.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is related to the handling of datetime data within the `quantile` function. The erroneous block concatenation involves datetime data columns leading to the inappropriate concatenation attempt. The function does not properly handle this scenario where the internal block operations for datetime data result in an invalid concatenation attempt.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To address the bug, the `quantile` function should be modified to correctly handle datetime data when computing quantiles. Proper validations should be added to prevent block concatenation issues with datetime columns. An adjustment in the block concatenation section is necessary to account for the variations in data types that may occur during the quantile computation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
The corrected version below addresses the issue by explicitly excluding non-numeric columns before performing any block operations. The adjustments ensure that the operations are suitable for the data types present.

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    # Exclude non-numeric columns if numeric_only is True
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    # Exclude datetime and timedelta data
    data = data.select_dtypes(exclude=['datetime64', 'timedelta64'])

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result    
```

The correction ensures that only numeric columns are considered for the quantile computation, addressing the block concatenation issue with invalid data types. The corrected function should now correctly compute quantiles for DataFrames with mixed data columns.
