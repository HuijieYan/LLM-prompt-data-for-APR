### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates a `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate`, which suggests an issue with concatenation of arrays.
2. The function `quantile` should return values at the given quantile over the requested axis. The bug seems to be occurring in the concatenation of numerical data for quantile calculation.
3. The `Dataframe` has datetime data which is causing the error during concatenate.
4. The strategy for fixing the bug involves ensuring that the concatenation step is handled appropriately for all data types, especially when dealing with datetime data.
5. The correction should address the issue by managing datetime data within the concatenation process to ensure that it does not lead to the `ValueError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.
    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._get_numeric_data()._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected version, the `_get_numeric_data()` method is called before performing `quantile` calculation. This ensures that only numeric data is considered for quantile calculation, avoiding the concatenation issue with datetime data.
