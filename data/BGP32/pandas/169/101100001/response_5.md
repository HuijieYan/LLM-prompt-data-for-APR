## Analysis:
The buggy function `quantile` in the `DataFrame` class is overridden with the same signature but slightly different implementation. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles empty DataFrames when calculating quantiles.

## Identifying potential error locations:
1. The `_check_percentile(q)` function is called but its implementation is not provided in the code snippet.
2. The `_get_numeric_data()` method is called to filter numeric data, but it might not handle empty DataFrames correctly.
3. The `is_transposed` variable is set based on the axis value, but its usage in the calculation might be incorrect.
4. The handling of results when `result.ndim == 2` seems to be the cause of the bug.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs when the input DataFrame is empty, resulting in unexpected behavior in the quantile calculation. The `_get_numeric_data()` method or the handling of the transposed DataFrame might not be treating empty DataFrames correctly, leading to failures in the test.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check and handle the case of an empty DataFrame at the beginning of the `quantile` function.
2. Ensure that the logic to handle the transposed DataFrame is correct.
3. Adjust the calculation and handling of the result when `result.ndim != 2`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    if self.empty:
        return self if isinstance(self, Series) else DataFrame()

    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=0 if is_transposed else 1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result, index=self.columns)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, index=[q])

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

By explicitly checking for an empty DataFrame at the beginning and handling it appropriately, the corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing test.
