The bug in the `quantile` function is likely related to how it handles empty DataFrames or DataFrames with no numeric data while attempting to calculate the quantile. The error message indicates an issue with concatenation, suggesting a problem with handling data structures during the calculation process.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the function not accounting for empty data correctly. When an empty DataFrame is provided, the function fails to handle it appropriately, leading to the concatenation error during quantile calculation.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to handle empty DataFrames or DataFrames with no numeric data separately. By checking for the presence of data before attempting the quantile calculation, we can prevent the concatenation error that arises from empty structures.

Here is a corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data()
    
    if data.empty:  # Check if the DataFrame is empty or has no numeric data
        return self._constructor()
    
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T
    
    return result
```

This corrected function explicitly handles the case where the DataFrame is empty or contains no numeric data by returning an empty DataFrame with the correct structure. This modification should resolve the error related to concatenation when an empty DataFrame is provided.

By implementing this change, the `quantile` function should now properly handle empty DataFrames and DataFrames without numeric data, ensuring that the quantile calculation works correctly in all scenarios.
