### Explanation of the Bug

The bug in the `quantile` function is related to the handling of empty data. When a DataFrame with no columns is passed to this function, it's expected to handle this case gracefully and not try to perform operations like concatenation on empty data arrays. The error message indicates that the code is trying to concatenate empty arrays, causing a `ValueError`.

The function is structured to first check if the data is numeric based on the `numeric_only` parameter. If data is not numeric, it uses the original DataFrame `self`, which may lead to issues later on.

### Bug Location
The potential error locations within the buggy function are:

1. When getting the numeric data using `_get_numeric_data()` if `numeric_only=True`. This function may return an empty DataFrame.
2. During the operation of transposing the DataFrame.

### Bug Cause
When an empty DataFrame without columns is passed, the function incorrectly attempts to perform operations on this empty data. Specifically, the concatenation operation fails as there are no arrays to concatenate, leading to a `ValueError`. This issue arises due to insufficient handling of empty data conditions.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to ensure proper handling of empty data within the `quantile` function. We should check for empty data conditions and handle them gracefully to avoid errors related to the concatenation of empty arrays.

Here is the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over the requested axis.
    """
    self._check_percentile(q)
    
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1
    
    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T
    
    if data.empty:
        # Handle empty data case gracefully
        if is_transposed:
            return self.copy().T
        else:
            return self.copy()
    
    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )
    
    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)
    
    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T
    
    return result
```

This corrected version includes a check for empty data (DataFrame with no columns) at the beginning of the function before any operations that may lead to errors. If the data is empty, it returns a copy of the original DataFrame to maintain consistency.

By handling empty data conditions properly, this corrected function should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test cases provided.
