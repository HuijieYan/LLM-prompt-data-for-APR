### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function is quantile within the DataFrame class in the pandas library. The main issue arises in the quantile method which is intended to return values at the given quantile over a specified axis. However, when using the method with datetime data in a DataFrame, it raises a ValueError due to not handling datetime data appropriately.
   
2. Potential error locations:
   a. Calculation of data: There could be a problem in extracting numeric data correctly.
   b. axis handling: The axis might not be handled properly causing issues with transposing the data.
   c. Concatenation: Issues could arise during concatenation of arrays during calculation.

3. Cause of the bug:
   The bug occurs when calling the quantile method on a DataFrame object with datetime data. The method fails to handle datetime data correctly leading to errors during array concatenation since the quantile operation is internally trying to perform operations not suitable for datetime data.
 
4. Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
   To fix the bug, we should ensure that the quantile method correctly handles datetime data. Specifically, it should either exclude datetime data from the quantile calculations or transform them appropriately to handle the calculations. Additionally, axis handling should be reviewed for any discrepancies causing improper transposing of data.

### Bug-fixed version of the function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if numeric_only:
        data = self.select_dtypes(include=[np.number])
    else:
        data = self

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)

    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(q=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed)

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

By applying the changes from the bug-fixed version above, the quantile method should now handle datetime data correctly and return the expected output. This corrected version resolves the issues with datetime data handling and ensures proper concatenation of arrays in the quantile calculation.
