1. The buggy function `quantile` within the `DataFrame` class from the `pandas.core.frame` file is designed to calculate quantiles over a specified axis. The error message indicates an issue with concatenation, specifically that there are no arrays to concatenate.

2. The potential error locations within the buggy function could be related to how the data is handled and processed before being quantiled.

3. The error message `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate` suggests that there are no arrays to concatenate, leading to the failure of the operation. This could mean that the function is not receiving the expected data format or that there is a problem with handling the data structure.

4. One potential strategy for fixing the bug could involve ensuring that the data is correctly processed and stored as arrays before attempting to perform concatenation. Checking the data types and formats at each step of the quantile calculation process could help identify where the issue arises.

5. Here is a corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    if data.empty:  # Check if the data is empty to avoid concatenation error
        return DataFrame()

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In this corrected version, we added a check `if data.empty:` before attempting to perform any operations on the data. This check ensures that if the data is empty, a new empty DataFrame is returned, preventing the concatenation error.
