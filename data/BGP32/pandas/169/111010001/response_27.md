1. The buggy function is the `quantile` method defined within the `DataFrame` class in the `pandas/core/frame.py` file. This function is meant to return values at the given quantile over a requested axis. The error message indicates a `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate` which is occurring when trying to concatenate arrays in the `quantile` function.

2. The potential error locations within the function could be where the data is retrieved using `_get_numeric_data()` and where quantiles are computed by calling `data._data.quantile()`. There might be an issue with handling empty data frames or with the concatenation of arrays.

3. The cause of the bug could be related to an empty data frame being passed to the `quantile` function, resulting in an attempt to concatenate arrays that do not exist, hence the `ValueError`. The error occurs when trying to concatenate the arrays to compute the quantiles, but there are no arrays available to concatenate.

4. To fix the bug, a check needs to be added at the beginning of the `quantile` function to handle empty data frames. If the input data frame is empty, an appropriate response should be returned without attempting to compute the quantiles.

5. Here is a corrected version of the `quantile` function that includes a check for empty data frames:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)
    
    if self.empty:
        return self._constructor()
    
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1
    
    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T
    
    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )
    
    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)
    
    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T
    
    return result
```

By including the check `if self.empty:` at the beginning of the function, we ensure that an empty data frame will return an empty dataframe immediately, preventing the attempt to concatenate arrays in that scenario.
