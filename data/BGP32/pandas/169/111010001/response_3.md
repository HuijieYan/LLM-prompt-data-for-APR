1. The buggy function is `quantile` within the `DataFrame` class in the `pandas` library. This function is used to compute quantiles over a specified axis in a DataFrame. The error message indicates a `ValueError` related to concatenating arrays.

2. Potential error locations within the buggy function are where arrays are being concatenated. This could be related to the `_data.quantile` method where the result is being computed.

3. The cause of the bug could be a situation where the function is expecting to concatenate arrays, but due to some specific input or condition, there are no arrays to concatenate, leading to the `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate`.

4. One strategy for fixing the bug could be to add a check before attempting the concatenation to ensure that there are arrays to concatenate. Additionally, checking the input data and any conditions that may affect the presence of arrays for concatenation could help prevent this error.

5. Here is a corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.
    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    if data._data.shape[0] == 0 or data._data.shape[1] == 0:  # Check if there are arrays to concatenate
        raise ValueError("No data to compute quantile.")

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected version includes a check to ensure that there is data available to compute the quantile before attempting any array concatenation, which should help prevent the `ValueError` seen in the failing test.
