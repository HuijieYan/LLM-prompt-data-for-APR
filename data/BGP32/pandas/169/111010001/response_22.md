1. The buggy function is the `quantile` method within the `DataFrame` class of the `pandas` library. The function is responsible for returning values at the given quantile over requested axis. The error message is related to a `ValueError` occurring in the `concat_compat` function while attempting to concatenate values.

2. The potential error locations within the `quantile` function include the data retrieval, quantile calculation, and result construction sections.

3. The cause of the bug is likely due to the `data` variable not containing any data to perform calculations on. This could lead to an empty array error when trying to concatenate the data.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that there is data available for quantile calculation. This can be achieved by checking if the `data` variable is not empty before proceeding with the quantile calculation.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)
    
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    if data.empty:
        raise ValueError("Cannot calculate quantile on empty data.")

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1
    
    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T
    
    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

By including the check for empty data at the beginning of the function, we ensure that the function does not attempt calculations on empty data, thus preventing the `ValueError` caused by an attempt to concatenate empty arrays.
