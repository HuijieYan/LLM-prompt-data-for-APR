1. Analysis:
   - The buggy function is the `quantile` method within the `DataFrame` class in the `pandas` library.
   - The method calculates quantiles over a specified axis of the DataFrame.
   - The error message indicates a `ValueError` related to concatenation, specifically needing at least one array to concatenate.
  
2. Error Locations:
   - The error is likely occurring when trying to concatenate arrays, as the `quantile` method constructs a result based on the quantiles calculated from the data.
   - The issue could be in the section where the `result` is being prepared depending on the dimensions of the data.

3. Cause of the Bug:
   - The bug seems related to how the quantiles are calculated and results are being constructed into a new DataFrame or Series.
   - The error message suggests that there might be an empty array being used for concatenation, causing the `ValueError`.

4. Bug Fix Strategy:
   - To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the data array being concatenated to form the `result` is not empty.
   - This could involve checking the dimensions of the data before the concatenation step and handling the case of an empty array appropriately.
   - A conditional check to verify the presence of data before concatenation might be necessary.

5. Corrected Version of the `quantile` function:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    if data.empty:
        # Handling case of empty data array
        if isinstance(q, (float, int)):
            return pd.Series(index=self.columns, dtype='float64')
        else:
            return pd.DataFrame(index=q, columns=self.columns, dtype='float64')

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

By incorporating a check for an empty data array and returning appropriate empty Series or DataFrame structures, we can avoid the `ValueError` related to concatenation of empty arrays and resolve the bug in the `quantile` function.
