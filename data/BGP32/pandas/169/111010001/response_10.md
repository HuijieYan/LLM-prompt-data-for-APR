1. The buggy function `quantile` within the `DataFrame` class in `pandas/core/frame.py` is designed to return values at the given quantile over the requested axis. The error message indicates a `ValueError` related to needing at least one array to concatenate.

2. The potential error location within the buggy function seems to be in the `result = data._data.quantile(...)` line, where the result is being calculated based on the quantile function.

3. The cause of the bug could be due to the `quantile` function not correctly handling the data when trying to concatenate values. This might be due to an issue with the data structure or the logic behind fetching and manipulating the data for quantile calculation.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `data` variable assigned within the function contains the data needed for quantile calculation and that the concatenation operation is applied correctly. It's important to handle cases where there may be no data to concatenate to avoid the `ValueError`.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    if data.empty:
        return self._constructor(data)

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

By adding a condition to check for empty data before performing any operations that require concatenation, we ensure that the function can handle empty data appropriately without causing a `ValueError`. This should address the issue reported in the failing test.
