1. The buggy function is `quantile` within the `DataFrame` class in the `pandas/core/frame.py` file. The function is intended to return values at the given quantile over the requested axis based on the input parameters.

2. The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
   - Incorrect handling of transposed data leading to potential issues with concatenation of arrays.
   - Inconsistent data manipulation for transposed and non-transposed cases.

3. The cause of the bug is likely due to a ValueError being raised during array concatenation within the `quantile` function. This error occurs because the function is unable to concatenate the arrays properly, which may be related to incorrect axis handling or data transposition within the function.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the data manipulation is consistent for both transposed and non-transposed cases. Additionally, we should review the handling of arrays in the concatenation step to avoid the ValueError.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    result = data._data.quantile(q, axis, interpolation)
    
    if isinstance(result, type(data)):
        return self._constructor(result)
    else:
        return result
```

By simplifying the function and ensuring consistent data handling, we aim to address the issue with array concatenation and prevent the ValueError from occurring during the quantile operation.
