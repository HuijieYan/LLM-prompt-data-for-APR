1. The buggy function is the `quantile` method within the `DataFrame` class in the `pandas/core/frame.py` file. This method is used to calculate the quantiles of a DataFrame along a specific axis. The error message is related to a `ValueError` occurring during concatenation of arrays, specifically when trying to concatenate an empty list.

2. The potential error locations within the buggy function include:
   - The usage of the `pd.DataFrame` constructor without passing any column data may lead to an empty DataFrame.
   - The method `_get_numeric_data()` is being used to filter numeric data, but if there are no numeric columns, this could lead to an empty DataFrame.
   - The concatenation operation in the `quantile` method is expected to handle at least one array, so if the input data is empty, it could cause a `ValueError`.

3. The cause of the bug arises from passing an empty DataFrame to the `quantile` method, which later tries to concatenate arrays within the `_data.quantile` call. Since there are no arrays to concatenate, a `ValueError` is raised at that point.

4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when the input DataFrame is empty correctly. We can check if the DataFrame is empty and return an empty DataFrame or a similar default value when no data is available to calculate quantiles. This check can be performed before attempting to calculate quantiles to prevent the `ValueError`.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `quantile` method that handles the case of an empty DataFrame:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.
    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if len(self) == 0:  # Check if the DataFrame is empty
        return self._constructor([], index=self.index, columns=self.columns)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

By adding a check for an empty DataFrame at the beginning of the `quantile` method, we can avoid the `ValueError` during concatenation. This check ensures that when the DataFrame is empty, an empty DataFrame with the correct index and columns is returned, preventing errors in subsequent calculations.
