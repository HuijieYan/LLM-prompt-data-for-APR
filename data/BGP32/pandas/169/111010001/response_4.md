1. The buggy function is the `quantile` method within the `DataFrame` class in the pandas library. This method is used to return values at the given quantile over a requested axis in a DataFrame. The error message indicates a `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate` which suggests an issue related to concatenation of arrays.

2. The potential error locations within the buggy function could be where the concatenation operation is performed within the `quantile` method, specifically in the line where `result = data._data.quantile(qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed)`.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `quantile` method is attempting to concatenate empty arrays when there is no numeric data available in the DataFrame. This leads to the `ValueError` as no arrays are present to concatenate. This issue arises when the DataFrame has no numeric columns, and the `quantile` method tries to calculate the quantile for a non-numeric DataFrame.

4. To fix the bug, one approach is to check if there is any numeric data present in the DataFrame before performing the quantile calculation. If there is no numeric data available, return an appropriate error message or handle the case differently to avoid the concatenation of empty arrays. This can be achieved by modifying the logic within the `quantile` method to handle this edge case.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `quantile` method:

```python
    def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
        self._check_percentile(q)
        
        data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
        if data.empty:
            raise ValueError("Cannot calculate quantile on empty DataFrame")
        
        axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
        is_transposed = axis == 1

        if is_transposed:
            data = data.T

        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
        )
        
        if result.ndim == 2:
            result = self._constructor(result)
        else:
            result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

        if is_transposed:
            result = result.T

        return result
```

By adding a check `if data.empty` after getting the numeric data, we can avoid the concatenation of empty arrays and raise a `ValueError` with a meaningful message when trying to calculate the quantile on an empty DataFrame. This modification ensures that the function will handle the edge case of an empty DataFrame gracefully.
