1. The buggy function in question is the `quantile` method within the `DataFrame` class in the pandas library. The purpose of this method is to return values at the given quantile over a requested axis. It takes parameters like `q` for quantile, `axis` for row or column-wise selection, `numeric_only` to consider only numeric values, and `interpolation` to specify the method for interpolation between data points.

2. The potential error location within the `quantile` method is in the following line:
```python
values = concat_compat([b.values for b in blocks])
```
This line is trying to concatenate the values from blocks, but the list of blocks might be empty, leading to a `ValueError`. This issue needs to be addressed.

3. The cause of the bug is that when the `data` object is processed in the `_data.quantile` method, it may lead to an empty list of blocks that need to be concatenated. This results in a `ValueError` stating that at least one array needs to be concatenated.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
    - Check if there are any blocks to concatenate before performing the operation.
    - Add a check to handle the case where no blocks exist to prevent the `ValueError`.
    
5. Corrected version of the `quantile` method:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    if hasattr(result, 'blocks') and not result.blocks:
        return self._constructor()  # Return an empty DataFrame

    return result
```

This corrected version adds a check to ensure that there are blocks present in the `result` before performing concatenation. If no blocks are found, an empty DataFrame is returned to avoid the `ValueError`.
