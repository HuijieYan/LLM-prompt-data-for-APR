### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs when the function `quantile` is called with an empty DataFrame, which can happen if all columns are dropped during the `self._get_numeric_data()` operation. This leads to an empty `data` DataFrame being used in the subsequent operations, causing a `ValueError` during concatenation.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The error message `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate` indicates that an attempt to concatenate empty arrays or objects has been made, which is likely due to the `data` DataFrame being empty.
   
2. In the failing test case, an empty DataFrame is used for quantile calculation, causing the empty `data` DataFrame to be constructed.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where we have an empty DataFrame gracefully. One approach is to add a check to ensure that the `data` DataFrame is not empty before proceeding with quantile calculations. If it is empty, we can return an empty Series or DataFrame right away without attempting further calculations.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if data.empty:
        return self._constructor(data)

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

By adding the check `if data.empty:` before any operations that rely on the `data` DataFrame being non-empty, we ensure that an empty DataFrame is handled correctly, preventing the `ValueError`. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases and handle empty DataFrames gracefully.
