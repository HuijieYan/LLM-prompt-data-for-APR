1. Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with related functions, corresponding error message:
The buggy function in the DataFrame class of the pandas library is the quantile function. The error message is raised during the execution of the quantile function when calling the `concatenate` function, indicating that there are no arrays to concatenate. It seems to be an issue with the data being passed for concatenation, potentially due to empty data frames handling.

2. Identify potential error locations within the buggy function:
The error seems to occur when trying to concatenate data, possibly due to missing data being passed for concatenation.

3. Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the related functions, the corresponding error message:
In the quantile function, there is a line where it attempts to concatenate the data, and in this case, there might be an issue with providing empty data frames. The error message directly points to the fact that there are no arrays provided for concatenation.

4. Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, we need to handle the scenario where empty data frames are passed to the quantile function. It would be best to check if there is any data available for concatenation before proceeding with the operation.

5. Corrected version of the function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    q : float or array-like, default 0.5 (50% quantile)
        Value between 0 <= q <= 1, the quantile(s) to compute.
    axis : {0, 1, 'index', 'columns'} (default 0)
        Equals 0 or 'index' for row-wise, 1 or 'columns' for column-wise.
    numeric_only : bool, default True
        If False, the quantile of datetime and timedelta data will be
        computed as well.
    interpolation : {'linear', 'lower', 'higher', 'midpoint', 'nearest'}
        This optional parameter specifies the interpolation method to use,
        when the desired quantile lies between two data points `i` and `j`:

        * linear: `i + (j - i) * fraction`, where `fraction` is the
          fractional part of the index surrounded by `i` and `j`.
        * lower: `i`.
        * higher: `j`.
        * nearest: `i` or `j` whichever is nearest.
        * midpoint: (`i` + `j`) / 2.

    Returns
    -------
    Series or DataFrame

        If ``q`` is an array, a DataFrame will be returned where the
          index is ``q``, the columns are the columns of self, and the
          values are the quantiles.
        If ``q`` is a float, a Series will be returned where the
          index is the columns of self and the values are the quantiles.

    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only and not self.empty else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected version:
- Added a check to ensure that if the dataframe 'self' is empty, then 'numeric_only' will be ignored when selecting data for quantile calculation.
- This check ensures that the data provided for concatenation is not empty, avoiding the ValueError related to concatenating empty arrays.
