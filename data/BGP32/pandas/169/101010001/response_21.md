Based on the provided buggy function and the error message from the failing test, the issue seems to be related to data not being correctly processed for quantile calculation. The error message "ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate" suggests that an attempt is made to concatenate empty arrays, which leads to this error.

### Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the buggy function lies in the `quantile` function, where the `data._data.quantile()` method is called to calculate quantiles. The issue might arise due to incorrect handling or processing of the input data.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by calling `data._data.quantile()` with empty data or data that is not properly processed to calculate the quantile. The function should first check for the presence of valid data before attempting to calculate the quantile, especially when dealing with empty or incomplete data.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that valid data is present before trying to calculate the quantile. We can add a check to verify if there is data available for quantile calculation. If the data is empty or invalid, we should handle it appropriately to avoid the ValueError.

### Corrected Version:
I have corrected the bug in the `quantile` function by adding a check for valid data before calculating the quantile. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    q : float or array-like, default 0.5 (50% quantile)
        Value between 0 <= q <= 1, the quantile(s) to compute.
    axis : {0, 1, 'index', 'columns'} (default 0)
        Equals 0 or 'index' for row-wise, 1 or 'columns' for column-wise.
    numeric_only : bool, default True
        If False, the quantile of datetime and timedelta data will be
        computed as well.
    interpolation : {'linear', 'lower', 'higher', 'midpoint', 'nearest'}
        This optional parameter specifies the interpolation method to use,
        when the desired quantile lies between two data points `i` and `j`:

        * linear: `i + (j - i) * fraction`, where `fraction` is the
          fractional part of the index surrounded by `i` and `j`.
        * lower: `i`.
        * higher: `j`.
        * nearest: `i` or `j` whichever is nearest.
        * midpoint: (`i` + `j`) / 2.

    Returns
    -------
    Series or DataFrame

    If ``q`` is an array, a DataFrame will be returned where the
        index is ``q``, the columns are the columns of self, and the
        values are the quantiles.
    If ``q`` is a float, a Series will be returned where the
        index is the columns of self and the values are the quantiles.

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T
    
    if data.empty:
        raise ValueError("Input data is empty. Cannot calculate quantile.")
    
    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected version of the function, I added a check for empty data before attempting to calculate the quantile. If the data is empty, a ValueError is raised to handle this scenario appropriately. This fix should prevent the ValueError related to concatenating empty arrays.
