1. **Analysis**: The buggy function in the `pandas/core/frame.py` file is the `quantile` method of the `DataFrame` class. The error message indicates a `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate`. This error message occurs when attempting to concatenate arrays, but there are no arrays to concatenate.
   
2. **Potential Error Location**:
   - The error could be related to the selection of data based on the `numeric_only` flag. If no numeric data is found after filtering, there might be an attempt to concatenate empty arrays.
   - The problem might also lie in how the quantile calculation is performed based on the data available.
   
3. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - The bug seems to stem from the way the `data` is selected based on `numeric_only` and then processed for quantile calculations. If the `data` does not contain any numeric data following the filtering, it might lead to an empty array, causing the concatenation error.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**:
   - Ensure that the data selected based on `numeric_only` does contain at least one array for concatenation. This can be achieved by adjusting the logic for selecting the correct data.
   - Check the data integrity and handling during the quantile calculation to avoid empty arrays in the concatenation step.

5. **Corrected Version**:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation='linear'):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.
    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    # Check if there is at least one array to avoid ValueError when concatenating
    if data.empty:
        raise ValueError("No numeric data to calculate quantile")

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

By adding an explicit check for `data.empty` before proceeding with the quantile calculation, we ensure that there is at least one array available for concatenation, thus preventing the `ValueError` when no numeric data is present.
