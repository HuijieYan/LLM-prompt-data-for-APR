The potential error location in the buggy function is the part where the `data` variable is defined. Depending on the condition of `numeric_only`, the function retrieves specific data from the DataFrame. However, the implementation is flawed in terms of handling empty DataFrames or DataFrames where all columns are dropped during processing.

The cause of the bug lies in the fact that when an empty DataFrame gets passed to the buggy `quantile` function, it fails to return the correct result due to improper handling of the data cleanup process.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `data` assignment logic to consider scenarios where the `data` DataFrame is empty after the `numeric_only` filtering operation. Additionally, it's essential to handle the case of empty or dropped columns correctly during subsequent calculations.

Here is the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.
    """
    self._check_percentile(q)
    
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1
    
    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T
    
    if data.empty:
        return self._constructor(data)
    
    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )
    
    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)
    
    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T
    
    return result
```

By incorporating an early return for empty `data`, this corrected version addresses the issue of failing to handle empty DataFrames correctly. This modification ensures that the function can handle cases where all columns are dropped during processing and properly return the expected result.
