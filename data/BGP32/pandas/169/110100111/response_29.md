### Bug Analysis:
1. The bug is located in the `quantile` function of the `DataFrame` class in `pandas/core/frame.py`.
2. The bug seems to occur when working with datetime data.
3. The test case provided involves creating a DataFrame from `pd.date_range` and then applying `quantile()` on it. The expected output is an empty DataFrame or Series, which is not achieved due to the bug.
4. The bug seems to be arising from the internal data manipulation related to datetime data where concatenation operations are failing.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the internal data manipulation and outcome generation work correctly without causing errors or returning unexpected results.

### Proposed Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure proper handling of datetime data in the quantile computation.
2. Modify the data processing steps to accommodate datetime data while avoiding any concatenation errors.
3. Verify that the intermediate data structures and the final result meet the expected output criteria.

### Code Fix:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.loc[data.columns].quantile(
        q=q, axis=0, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if q if isinstance(q, (float, int)) else False:
        result.index = [q]
        result = result.T  # Convert Series to DataFrame
    
    return result
```

### Changes Made:
1. Corrected the line where the calculation is being made with `quantile()` method by changing `axis=1` to `axis=0`.
2. Added indexing check to ensure that for single value quantile `q`, the output is aligned correctly.
3. Transposed the result when `q` is a single value to maintain consistency with the expected output.

This fix should address the bug related to quantile calculations on DataFrames containing datetime data and ensure correct outputs as expected in the test cases provided.
