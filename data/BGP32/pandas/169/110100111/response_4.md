## Analysis:
1. The buggy function, `quantile`, is supposed to return quantiles of the input data along the specified axis. It uses internal functionalities like `_get_numeric_data`, `_get_axis_number`, and `_data.quantile` to perform the quantile calculations.
2. The failing test, `test_quantile_empty_no_columns`, creates a DataFrame with datetime values, and the quantile calculation fails to handle this scenario. The expected output consists of empty DataFrames or Series depending on the input format.
3. The main issue reported in the GitHub ticket is that quantile method is broken when dealing with datetime data in a DataFrame, but it works fine with Series. The error message indicates a problem with concatenation of arrays during quantile calculation.

## Bug Cause:
The buggy function fails when handling datetime data in a DataFrame due to incorrect data manipulation. It likely throws an error during the quantile calculation process.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure the `quantile` function can handle datetime data correctly in the DataFrame by properly manipulating the data before performing calculations. Additionally, we need to make sure the quantile method follows the same logic for both Series and DataFrames, as it is intended to do.

## Bug Fix and Corrected Function:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    if isinstance(q, list):  # Handling q as a list
        qs = np.array(q)
        transposed = np.transpose(data.to_numpy())
        result = np.nanquantile(transposed, qs, interpolation=interpolation, axis=0)
        result = pd.DataFrame(result, index=qs, columns=data.columns)
    else:  # Handling q as a single value
        result = data.quantile(q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, numeric_only=numeric_only)

    return result.T if is_transposed else result
```

This corrected function will now handle cases where `q` is passed as a list and return the quantiles for each value in the list. It also handles the regular DataFrame quantile calculation outside of the list scenario. This corrected approach should fix the bug and pass the failing test case.
