### Analysis:
The buggy function is the `quantile` method defined in the `DataFrame` class in the `pandas/core/frame.py` file. The function aims to return values at a given quantile over the specified axis. The bug seems to be related to the handling of datetime data within the DataFrame.

### Error Location:
The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The `_get_numeric_data()` method call to filter numeric data.
2. Calculating the `result` based on interpolated quantiles which may not handle datetime data correctly.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug appears to be caused by the way the `quantile` function handles datetime data when applied to a DataFrame. The internal processing of the DataFrame data type does not properly account for datetime objects, resulting in a ValueError upon quantile calculation. The failing test case in the GitHub issue further confirms this issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the quantile calculations correctly handle datetime data within the DataFrame. This may involve modifying how numeric data is filtered, and possibly adjusting the calculation logic for quantiles to handle datetime objects appropriately.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is an updated version of the `quantile` function that should resolve the bug:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data()._data if numeric_only else self._data
    result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation)

    if isinstance(result, pd.Series):
        return result
    else:
        return self._constructor(result)
```

This corrected version filters only the numeric data when necessary, uses the `quantile` function of the data and ensures the correct return type based on the result.

By implementing this corrected version, the bug related to datetime data in the `quantile` function should be resolved.
