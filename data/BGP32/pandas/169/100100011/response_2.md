### Analysis:
1. The `quantile` function is designed to return values at the given quantile over the requested axis for a DataFrame object in pandas.
2. The failing test `test_quantile_empty_no_columns` is checking if passing an empty DataFrame with date data columns to the `quantile` function causes any issues. The expected behavior is to have an empty Series or DataFrame based on the input, similar to when a normal Series is provided.
3. The GitHub issue describes the exact problem encountered, where using `pd.DataFrame(pd.date_range('1/1/18', periods=5)).quantile()` leads to a `ValueError` due to a concatenation issue when operating on date data in a DataFrame versus a Series.

### Bug Location:
The bug appears to be in the handling of date or non-numeric data in the DataFrame within the `quantile` function, leading to an error during internal operations.

### Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is that when the `_get_numeric_data()` function is applied to the DataFrame with date columns, it returns an empty DataFrame, which in turn causes downstream issues related to concatenation and data processing within the function. This discrepancy in behavior between Series and DataFrame processing results in the error.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic for handling non-numeric data (in this case, date data) in the `quantile` function. The function should identify the non-numeric columns and handle them appropriately to avoid errors during data processing. It should also ensure consistent behavior between Series and DataFrame inputs regarding quantile calculation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if numeric_only:
        data = self._get_numeric_data()
    else:
        data = self._get_numeric_data()._copy()
        data[data.select_dtypes(include=['datetime64']).columns] = pd.np.nan  # Convert date columns to NaN

    is_transposed = data.shape[1] < data.shape[0] and axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the above corrected version:
1. The non-numeric data handling logic has been modified to set date columns to `NaN` if `numeric_only` is False. This prevents errors related to non-numeric data during computations.
2. A check for transposed data based on the shape of the DataFrame has been included to ensure proper transformation for the quantile operation.
3. The corrected version aims to handle non-numeric data and numeric input consistently between Series and DataFrame for correct quantile calculation.
