### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `quantile` in the `DataFrame` class is overriding the same function declared before in the class, which is causing the conflict and leading to errors.
2. The error message indicates a `ValueError` related to concatenating arrays.
3. The cause of the bug is due to the conflict between the two `quantile` functions declared in the `DataFrame` class. The overriding function is not correctly implemented, leading to errors during execution.
4. The strategy to fix the bug is to remove the overriding `quantile` function and ensure that the implementation of the first `quantile` function is correct and handles all the cases properly.

### Correction:
Given below is the corrected version of the `DataFrame` class with the removal of the overriding `quantile` function:

```python
class DataFrame(NDFrame):
    def _constructor(self):
        pass
    
    def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation='linear'):
        self._check_percentile(q)
    
        data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
        axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
        is_transposed = axis == 1
    
        if is_transposed:
            data = data.T
    
        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
        )
    
        if result.ndim == 2:
            result = self._constructor(result)
        else:
            result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)
    
        if is_transposed:
            result = result.T
    
        return result
```

By removing the second `quantile` function from the class and ensuring only one correct implementation is present, the conflict is resolved, and the corrected version should pass the failing test.
