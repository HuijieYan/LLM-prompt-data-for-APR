### Analysis
The buggy function is responsible for calculating quantiles over a specified axis in a DataFrame. The function takes parameters such as the quantile value (`q`), axis of calculation (`axis`), numeric_only flag, and interpolation method. 

The bug seems to arise from the incorrect calculation of the transposed data when the specified axis is not the default (0). The function incorrectly transposes the data which leads to issues in calculating the quantiles.

### Bug
The bug occurs when the function attempts to transpose the data for calculation based on the specified axis. The issue lies in the incorrect boolean comparison `is_transposed = axis == 1`. Due to this comparison, the data gets transposed regardless of the actual axis value provided leading to incorrect results.

### Proposed Fix
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the comparison for `is_transposed` based on the actual axis value. If the axis is 1, data should be transposed; otherwise, it should remain as is.

### Corrected Version
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axes = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=axes, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

With this corrected version, the function should now correctly calculate quantiles based on the provided axis without unnecessary transposition.
