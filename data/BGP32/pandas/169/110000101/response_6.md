### Explanation:
The buggy function `quantile` is designed to return values at the given quantile over the requested axis, either as a Series or a DataFrame. However, there are several issues in the current implementation that are causing problems:

1. The `_get_numeric_data` function used to extract numeric data from the DataFrame is not behaving correctly in all cases, leading to an empty DataFrame being returned.
2. The handling of transposing the data based on the specified axis is not consistent.
3. The construction of the result DataFrame or Series is not correct in all cases.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the function correctly extracts numeric data using `_get_numeric_data` or a suitable alternative.
2. Implement a consistent approach to handling transposition based on the specified axis.
3. Adjust the result construction logic to correctly form the output DataFrame or Series based on the input values.

### Corrected version of the `quantile` function:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation)

    if isinstance(q, list):
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected version:
1. The function uses the `quantile` function directly on `data` to calculate the quantile values.
2. Depending on the input `q`, the result DataFrame/Series is transposed back if necessary.
3. The function is more straightforward and aligns better with the expected behavior of calculating quantiles in a pandas DataFrame.
