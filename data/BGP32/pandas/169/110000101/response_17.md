The buggy function is the `quantile` method in the `DataFrame` class of pandas. The function is intended to calculate the quantile values over the specified axis. However, there are several issues in the function that need to be addressed:

1. The function incorrectly initializes the `data` variable as an empty DataFrame in both cases. This will lead to incorrect quantile calculation since it does not consider the actual DataFrame values.
2. The `is_transposed` variable is incorrectly determined which might lead to incorrect axis handling.
3. The `_data` attribute is accessed directly, which may not be the appropriate way to handle the DataFrame data.

To fix this function, we need to make sure that the `data` variable is correctly initialized with the actual DataFrame data. Additionally, we need to correctly handle the transposition of the data based on the specified axis.

Here is the corrected version of the `quantile` method:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=1-axis, interpolation=interpolation)

    if isinstance(q, list):
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected version ensures that the `data` variable contains the actual DataFrame values and handles transposition correctly based on the specified axis. It then calculates the quantile using the `quantile` method of the DataFrame, considering both row-wise and column-wise calculations.
