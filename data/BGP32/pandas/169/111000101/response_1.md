### Analysis
The buggy function `quantile` within the `DataFrame` class is intended to return values at the given quantile over a requested axis. The bug seems to be related to the handling of the input data and the selection of axis for computation. The function extracts numeric data from the DataFrame and performs the quantile calculation but has some issues with the transposition and slicing of the result.

### Bug Explanation
1. The function wrongly assumes that transposed data will have a different number of dimensions, leading to incorrect result processing.
2. In the case where the input data is not transposed, the function incorrectly processes the data and fails to handle the axis properly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the conditions for checking if the data is transposed. Additionally, we need to ensure correct slicing of the result based on the dimensions of the returned values.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    result = data._data.quantile(q=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed)

    if data._data.ndim == 1:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)
    else:
        result = self._constructor(result)

    return result
```

By making these corrections, the function should correctly compute the quantile over the requested axis while handling transposed data appropriately.
