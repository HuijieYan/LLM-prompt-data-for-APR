### Analysis
The buggy function is the `quantile` method within the `DataFrame` class. It is meant to return values at the given quantile over a requested axis. The function is expected to handle different types of input parameters such as floats or arrays for `q`, boolean for `numeric_only`, integers for `axis`, and strings for `interpolation`.

The bug seems to originate from the way the function is processing the input data and selecting the axis. The `data` variable is not correctly selected, leading to potential issues in subsequent operations. The incorrect handling of axis transpose is also a concern that might affect the final result.

### Bug Explanation
1. The function is intended to work with data in the DataFrame, but it incorrectly fetches `_get_numeric_data()` in the `data` variable, assuming only numeric data needs to be considered. However, if `numeric_only` is set to `False`, it should operate on all data, not just numerical data.
2. While attempting to determine the axis for calculations, the function performs the transpose operation incorrectly, leading to a potential issue in the subsequent calculation steps.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the selection of `data` based on the value of `numeric_only` parameter. If `numeric_only` is `True`, use `_get_numeric_data()`, otherwise, use `self` itself as the data.
2. Correct the transpose operation by updating the `is_transposed` flag based on the axis provided.

### Corrected Version
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that the input parameters are handled correctly, data selection is appropriate based on `numeric_only`, and the axis transpose operation is performed accurately. It should now return the expected output values for the provided test cases.
