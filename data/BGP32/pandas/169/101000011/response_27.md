### Analyzing the Buggy Function and the Related GitHub Issue

The provided buggy function is the `quantile` function in the `DataFrame` class. This function is intended to return values at the given quantile over the requested axis in a DataFrame. The bug is related to the incorrect behavior of the `quantile` function when dealing with datetime data.

The related GitHub issue highlights that calling the `quantile` function on a DataFrame containing datetime data raises a `ValueError` due to the need for at least one array to concatenate. However, this issue does not occur when calling the `quantile` function on a Series with datetime data.

### Identifying Potential Error Locations

One potential error location that might be causing the issue is the handling of datetime data conversion to arrays for processing within the `quantile` function in the DataFrame class.

### Explaining the Cause of the Bug

The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of datetime data within the `quantile` function. When datetime data is passed to the `quantile` function for a DataFrame, the internal processing involves an attempt to concatenate arrays, which leads to an error. This behavior is inconsistent with the expected behavior seen when calling `quantile` on a Series with datetime data.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, the `quantile` function in the `DataFrame` class needs to be adjusted to correctly handle datetime data. It is crucial to ensure that the processing of datetime data aligns with the behavior observed when calling `quantile` on a Series. This fix should involve specific handling of datetime data conversion or processing within the function.

### Corrected Version of the `quantile` Function

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    if data._is_datetimelike and numeric_only:
        data = data.select_dtypes(include=[np.datetime64, np.timedelta64])

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected version of the `quantile` function, an additional check is added to handle datetime data appropriately. If the `numeric_only` flag is set to `True`, the function will select only datetime and timedelta columns for processing. This adjustment ensures that the `quantile` function behaves consistently when dealing with datetime data in DataFrames.

By making this modification, the bug reported in the GitHub issue regarding the `quantile` function's behavior with datetime data in DataFrames should be resolved.
