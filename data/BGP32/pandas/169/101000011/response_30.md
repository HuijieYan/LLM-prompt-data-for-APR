### Analysis:
The buggy function is `quantile` within the `DataFrame` class in the `pandas` library. The reported GitHub issue states that the `quantile` function does not work correctly with datetime data when applied on a DataFrame although it works fine with a Series.

### Identified Error:
The error arises when the `DataFrame` is created with datetime data, and the `quantile` function is applied. The error occurs during the concatenation process in the internal Managers module (`pandas/core/internals/managers.py`).

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `_get_numeric_data` method is used to select only the numeric data in the DataFrame. When datetime data is involved, this method drops the datetime columns resulting in an empty DataFrame after the drop. Subsequently, during concatenation, an error is raised due to an attempt to concatenate empty arrays.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To address this issue, modify the function to include a check for the data type before dropping non-numeric columns. If the data contains datetime or timedelta columns, do not drop them and proceed with the quantile calculation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if numeric_only:
        data = self._get_numeric_data()
    else:
        data = self

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed)

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In this corrected version, the `numeric_only` flag is used to decide whether to drop non-numeric columns. If the flag is False (i.e., to include non-numeric columns like datetime columns), the dropping step is avoided, preventing the concatenation error that occurred with datetime data.

This correction should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug description and allow the `quantile` function to work correctly with datetime data in DataFrames.
