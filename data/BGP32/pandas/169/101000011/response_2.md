### Analysis:
- The buggy function is the `quantile()` method of the `DataFrame` class in `pandas/core/frame.py`.
- The issue reported on GitHub mentions that the `DataFrame` quantile method is broken specifically when dealing with DateTime data.
- The issue seems to be related to the internal handling of DateTime data in the `DataFrame` quantile method.

### Error Location:
- The error seems to arise when attempting to concatenate data in the `quantile` function, specifically in the `internals/managers.py` file.

### Explanation of the Bug:
- The bug occurs because the existing implementation of the `quantile` function does not correctly handle the operations related to DateTime data, leading to an error during concatenation internally.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that DateTime data is correctly handled within the `quantile` method. This requires adjusting the way the function deals with this type of data during computation.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if numeric_only:
        data = self._get_numeric_data()
    else:
        data = self

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    qs = q if isinstance(q, list) else [q]
    result = []

    for quantile_value in qs:
        column_result = {}
        for col in data:
            col_data = data[col]
            if isinstance(col_data, pd.Series):
                col_quantile = col_data.quantile(quantile_value, interpolation=interpolation)
                column_result[col] = col_quantile
            else:
                column_result[col] = np.nan

        result.append(column_result)

    if len(result) == 1:
        result = pd.Series(result[0])
    else:
        result = pd.DataFrame(result, index=qs)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In this corrected version, we iterate over multiple quantile values if `q` is an array, compute quantiles for each column individually, and then construct the result as a Series or DataFrame based on the shape of the input `q`.

By handling DateTime data properly and avoiding unnecessary concatenation issues, this corrected version should resolve the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
