### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `quantile` method in the `DataFrame` class of the pandas package.
2. The function calculates the quantile at the given level over a specific axis in a pandas DataFrame.
3. The bug causes an error when dealing with datetime data, as identified in the GitHub issue.
4. The error occurs during the concatenation of arrays, indicating an issue with handling datetime data.
5. The bug needs to be fixed to ensure consistent behavior across different data types within the `quantile` calculation.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function does not appropriately handle datetime data. When attempting to quantile a DataFrame containing datetime data, the function encounters an error during array concatenation. This issue arises due to the mismatch in handling datetime arrays, resulting in the expected output not being generated correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `quantile` function, we need to adjust the handling of datetime data, ensuring that the quantile calculation is performed correctly. This can be achieved by modifying the conditional flow within the function to appropriately process datetime data while avoiding errors during array operations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    # Extract numeric data if requested
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    # Handle special case for datetime data
    if data.select_dtypes(include=[np.datetime64]).columns.size > 0:
        result = data.apply(lambda x: x.quantile(q, interpolation=interpolation), axis=0)
    else:
        result = data._data.quantile(qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed)

    if isinstance(result, pd.Series):
        result.name = q
    else:
        result = self._constructor(result)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected version, the function appropriately handles datetime data by applying the `quantile` method directly to the datetime columns. This modification ensures that the quantile calculation behaves consistently across different data types within a DataFrame, resolving the bug highlighted in the GitHub issue.
