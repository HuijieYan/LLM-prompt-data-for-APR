### Analysis:
The buggy function is `quantile` within the `DataFrame` class in the pandas library. The function is designed to return values at the given quantile over a requested axis for a DataFrame. The issue reported on GitHub suggests that the `quantile` function is broken when dealing with datetime data, causing a `ValueError`. This issue seems to occur due to a problem with the concatenation process within the function.

### Error Location:
The potential error locations within the `quantile` function are likely related to the concatenation of array-like objects, particularly when handling datetime data.

### Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug can be traced back to the concatenation process in the function. When dealing with datetime data, the concatenation operation fails due to incorrect handling or incorrect data type conversion during the process, leading to a `ValueError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that datetime data is handled correctly during the concatenation process. This may involve converting datetime data to a compatible format for concatenation or ensuring that the concatenation operation accounts for datetime objects correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=0, numeric_only=numeric_only, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected version, the bug is fixed by ensuring that the `axis` parameter is set correctly when calling the `quantile` method on the underlying data object. Additionally, the `numeric_only` parameter is passed to the underlying method for consistency. This modification helps to address the issue reported on GitHub related to datetime data handling within the `quantile` function.
