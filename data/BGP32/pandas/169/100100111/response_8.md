The bug in the `quantile` function is related to the handling of empty DataFrames and leads to an error during the operation of the function. The issue reported on GitHub points out that the method should return results similar to what is expected from a Series when dealing with datetime data.

### Potential error locations:
1. The `_check_percentile` call may not handle empty DataFrames correctly.
2. The handling of `data` within the function may cause issues with empty DataFrames.
3. The construction of the result DataFrame might not be appropriate for certain cases.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug arises when the function receives an empty DataFrame as input like in the failing test. The function fails to handle the empty DataFrame properly, leading to unexpected behavior due to the incorrect concatenation of arrays to form the result.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle the case of empty DataFrames and return suitable outputs for these cases. A check for empty DataFrames should be made before executing the quantile computation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

Here is the corrected version of the `quantile` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.
    """
    if self.empty:
        # Handling the empty DataFrame case
        if isinstance(q, (int, float)):
            return pd.Series([], index=[q])
        elif isinstance(q, (list, np.ndarray)) and len(q) > 0:
            return pd.DataFrame([], index=q)
    
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected version checks if the DataFrame is empty at the beginning of the function and handles it appropriately by returning empty Series or DataFrame based on the type of `q`. This modification should resolve the issue with empty DataFrames and ensure correct behavior as expected.
