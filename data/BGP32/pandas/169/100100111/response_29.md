### Analyzing the Buggy Function and GitHub Issue
The buggy function, `quantile`, is intended to return values at the given quantiles over the requested axis for a DataFrame. The issue reported on GitHub highlights that the `quantile` function fails when dealing with DateTime data when using a DataFrame. The provided failing test `test_quantile_empty_no_columns` is designed to reveal the failure when all columns are dropped during the quantile operation.

### Potential Error Locations
1. The computation of `data` based on `_get_numeric_data()` when `numeric_only` is `True`, which may not retain all necessary columns.
2. Usage of `is_transposed` and incorrect behavior when transposing the data.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug stems from the DataFrame losing all columns during the operation due to how `data` is computed. The function `quantile` expects the DataFrame to retain the necessary columns, and the quantile operation fails when they are all discarded.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Ensure that `data` retains all columns even when `numeric_only` is `True`.
2. Correctly handle the transposing of data within the function.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if numeric_only:
        data = self.copy()  # Make a copy to retain all columns
    else:
        data = self

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected version, a copy of the DataFrame is retained if `numeric_only` is `True`, ensuring that all columns are preserved for the quantile operation. This avoids the issue of columns getting dropped and addresses the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
