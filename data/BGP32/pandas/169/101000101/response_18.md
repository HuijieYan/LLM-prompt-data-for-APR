### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `quantile` function arises from incorrectly handling the input parameter `q` when it is a list. The function expects `q` to be a float or array-like, but it doesn't process it correctly as an array when it is actually passed as a list.

When `q` is a list, the function fails to recognize it as an array-like input and attempts to perform operations assuming it is a float, leading to errors in subsequent calculations.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `q` parameter is properly processed as an array when it is passed as a list. This can be achieved by checking the type of `q` at the beginning of the function and converting it to a NumPy array if it is a list.

After converting `q` to a NumPy array, we can proceed with the quantile calculation as intended, ensuring that the function handles both float and array-like inputs correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
import numpy as np

def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.
    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if isinstance(q, list):
        q = np.array(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the `q` parameter is correctly handled as an array-like input, allowing the function to calculate the quantiles accurately for both float and array input cases.
