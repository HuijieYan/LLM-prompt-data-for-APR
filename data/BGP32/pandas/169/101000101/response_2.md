The buggy function `quantile` is intended to calculate quantiles over a specified axis in a DataFrame. However, there are several issues causing the function to fail:
1. The function `_constructor_sliced` is called within the function, but it is not defined or imported within the provided code snippet. This could be a potential reason for the failure.
2. The `self._check_percentile(q)` call is present, but the implementation of this method is missing.

To fix these issues, we need to define the `_constructor_sliced` function properly and ensure that the required methods like `_check_percentile` are implemented within the DataFrame class.

Here is the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
class DataFrame(NDFrame):
    
    def _constructor(self):
        pass
    
    def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation='linear'):
        """
        Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.
        """
        
        # Check percentile
        self._check_percentile(q)
        
        data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
        axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
        is_transposed = axis == 1

        if is_transposed:
            data = data.T

        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
        )

        if result.ndim == 2:
            result = self._constructor(result)
        else:
            result = result  # Placeholder for _constructor_sliced

        if is_transposed:
            result = result.T

        return result
```

Please ensure that the `_constructor_sliced` function is correctly implemented according to the requirements of the DataFrame class. Additionally, implement the `_check_percentile` method to handle percentile input validation within the DataFrame class.
