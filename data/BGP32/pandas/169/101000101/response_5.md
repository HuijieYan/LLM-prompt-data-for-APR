### Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided function lies in the incorrect handling of the input `q` when it is a list. The function is designed to process `q` either as a float or an array-like object. However, when `q` is passed as a list, the function fails to handle it properly leading to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function can handle `q` correctly when it is a list. This can be achieved by modifying the function to account for both float and array-like inputs. By checking the type of `q` and adjusting the logic accordingly, we can handle both scenarios effectively.

### Corrected Function
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if not isinstance(q, (list, np.ndarray)):
        q = [q]

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

### Explanation of Correction
In the corrected function, we check if `q` is not already an array-like object (list or numpy array). If `q` is not an array-like object, we convert it into a list by wrapping it in square brackets `[q]`. This ensures that the function can handle single float values correctly along with list values for `q`. The rest of the logic remains the same as in the original function.
