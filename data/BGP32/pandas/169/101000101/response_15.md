### Analysis
The buggy function `quantile` is supposed to return values at the given quantile over the requested axis. The function begins by checking the percentile values and then proceeds to manipulate the data based on various conditions related to `numeric_only` and `axis`. The function calculates the quantile values based on the provided interpolation method.

The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of transposed data and the creation of the resulting DataFrame or Series. In both cases, the data preparation and result extraction might be flawed.

### Bug Explanation
1. The bug arises when handling transposed data. The code incorrectly transposes the data but fails to consider this during the quantile calculation and result transformation.
2. The creation of the result DataFrame or Series at the end of the function seems to be faulty, especially when dealing with transposed data.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, it is necessary to:
1. Ensure that the transposed data is correctly handled throughout the quantile calculation process.
2. Verify the creation of the resulting Series or DataFrame to reflect the correct transformation based on the initial conditions.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1 if is_transposed else 0, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        cols = data.columns if is_transposed else data.T.columns
        result = self._constructor(result, index=q, columns=cols)
    else:
        cols = data.columns if is_transposed else data.T.columns
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, index=cols, name=q)

    return result
```

This corrected version of the function properly handles transposed data and constructs the resulting DataFrame or Series based on the initial conditions. It ensures that the data manipulation and result creation align with the input parameters and expected behavior.
