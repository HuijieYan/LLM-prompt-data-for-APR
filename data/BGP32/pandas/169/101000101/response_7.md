### Analysis:
The buggy function `quantile` is intended to return values at the given quantile over the requested axis based on specified parameters. The function processes the input data with interpolation methods and constructs the resulting DataFrame or Series accordingly.

The bug seems to originate from the way the function handles the transposed data, resulting in incorrect operations and potential errors in constructing the final output.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In the buggy function, the `is_transposed` variable is assigned based on whether the axis is 1. Then, within the subsequent processing steps, the data might be transposed (if `axis` is 1). However, the data is not always checked correctly for transposition, leading to inconsistencies in handling the data.

2. The `_check_percentile` method is refernced in the function, but its implementation and impact on the function are not explicitly shown. Depending on its behavior, it could contribute to the improper processing of the data.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the transposition of data is handled consistently and accurately. This involves properly identifying whether the data needs to be transposed before any processing occurs to align with the specified axis. 

Moreover, clarifying the role of `_check_percentile` method and ensuring its compatibility with the `quantile` function can help in stabilizing the function's behavior.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    q : float or array-like, default 0.5 (50% quantile)
        Value between 0 <= q <= 1, the quantile(s) to compute.
    axis : {0, 1, 'index', 'columns'} (default 0)
        Equals 0 or 'index' for row-wise, 1 or 'columns' for column-wise.
    numeric_only : bool, default True
        If False, the quantile of datetime and timedelta data will be
        computed as well.
    interpolation : {'linear', 'lower', 'higher', 'midpoint', 'nearest'}
        This optional parameter specifies the interpolation method to use,
        when the desired quantile lies between two data points `i` and `j`:

        * linear: `i + (j - i) * fraction`, where `fraction` is the
          fractional part of the index surrounded by `i` and `j`.
        * lower: `i`.
        * higher: `j`.
        * nearest: `i` or `j` whichever is nearest.
        * midpoint: (`i` + `j`) / 2.

    Returns
    -------
    Series or DataFrame

        If ``q`` is an array, a DataFrame will be returned where the
          index is ``q``, the columns are the columns of self, and the
          values are the quantiles.
        If ``q`` is a float, a Series will be returned where the
          index is the columns of self and the values are the quantiles.
    """

    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self

    if axis == 1:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=(axis == 1)
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        return self._constructor(result)
    else:
        return self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)
```

In this corrected version, the logic for data transposition is simplified to ensure consistent behavior based on the specified axis. This update aims to address the bug identified in the function.
