### Analysis
The buggy function `quantile` in the `DataFrame` class is intended to return values at the given quantile over a requested axis. The function has parameters for quantile `q`, axis, `numeric_only`, and `interpolation`. It is expected to handle different scenarios based on the input parameters and return a `Series` or `DataFrame` accordingly.

The potential error in the buggy function lies in the logic for handling transposed data. The variable `is_transposed` is used to determine if the data is transposed, but the logic based on this variable needs to be carefully handled to ensure correct outcome.

### Bug Explanation
1. In both Expected Case 1 and 2, the function sets the `is_transposed` variable based on the condition `axis == 1`. However, the subsequent logic that acts based on this variable might not produce the correct result, especially when dealing with transposed data.
2. When `is_transposed` is `True`, the function transposes the data for computations using `data = data.T`. However, the `result` is calculated without considering this transposed data. This leads to incorrect results when handling transposed data.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the data manipulation and computations correctly handle transposed data when `is_transposed` is `True`. We should adjust the logic to account for this scenario and make the necessary changes to handle transposed data appropriately.

### Corrected Code
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=0 if is_transposed else 1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        if is_transposed:
            result = result.T
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    return result
``` 

By applying these changes, the corrected function will handle transposed data correctly and provide the expected results for both scenarios outlined in the cases.
