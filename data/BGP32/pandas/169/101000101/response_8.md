The bug in the provided function lies in the calculation of the `is_transposed` variable, leading to incorrect behavior in the subsequent data processing steps. The `is_transposed` variable determines whether the DataFrame needs to be transposed before processing, but its value is not correctly calculated based on the given `axis`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the calculation of `is_transposed` to align with the axis parameter correctly. This will ensure that the DataFrame is transposed when necessary, leading to the correct computation of quantiles in both row-wise and column-wise operations.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/frame.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class DataFrame(NDFrame):
    def _constructor(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
        """
        Return values at the given quantile over the requested axis.

        Parameters
        ----------
        q : float or array-like, default 0.5 (50% quantile)
            Value between 0 <= q <= 1, the quantile(s) to compute.
        axis : {0, 1, 'index', 'columns'} (default 0)
            Equals 0 or 'index' for row-wise, 1 or 'columns' for column-wise.
        numeric_only : bool, default True
            If False, the quantile of datetime and timedelta data will be
            computed as well.
        interpolation : {'linear', 'lower', 'higher', 'midpoint', 'nearest'}
            This optional parameter specifies the interpolation method to use,
            when the desired quantile lies between two data points `i` and `j`:

        * linear: `i + (j - i) * fraction`, where `fraction` is the
          fractional part of the index surrounded by `i` and `j`.
        * lower: `i`.
        * higher: `j`.
        * nearest: `i` or `j` whichever is nearest.
        * midpoint: (`i` + `j`) / 2.

        Returns
        -------
        Series or DataFrame

        If ``q`` is an array, a DataFrame will be returned where the
          index is ``q``, the columns are the columns of self, and the
          values are the quantiles.
        If ``q`` is a float, a Series will be returned where the
          index is the columns of self and the values are the quantiles.
        """
        self._check_percentile(q)

        is_transposed = False
        if axis == 1 or axis == 'columns':
            is_transposed = True

        data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self

        if is_transposed:
            data = data.T

        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=1 if is_transposed else 0, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
        )

        if result.ndim == 2:
            result = self._constructor(result)
        else:
            result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

        if is_transposed:
            result = result.T

        return result
```

This correction ensures that the `is_transposed` variable is correctly calculated based on the `axis` parameter, leading to accurate transposition of the DataFrame for quantile computation. The function now correctly handles both row-wise and column-wise quantile calculations as expected.
