## Analysis:
The buggy function is supposed to return values at the given quantile over the requested axis. The bug seems to be related to concatenating empty DataFrames, causing a ValueError during execution. The function incorrectly handles the case where the DataFrame is empty or has a transposed layout.

## Error Locations:
1. The initialization of `data` based on `_get_numeric_data()` seems to cause an issue when the DataFrame is empty or contains no numeric data.
2. The handling of transposed DataFrame with `data.T` and `result.T` is incorrect, especially when the DataFrame is empty.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from incorrectly handling empty DataFrames or DataFrames with transposed layouts. When the bug function tries to concatenate DataFrames that have no data, it leads to a `ValueError` because the concatenation operation requires at least one array to concatenate.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if the DataFrame has any data before creating `data` to avoid issues with empty DataFrames.
2. Address the transposed layout issue to ensure correct handling, especially when the DataFrame might be transposed.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if self.empty:
        return self  # Return the empty DataFrame if there is no data

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    # Check again after transposing
    if data.empty:
        return data

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected version includes checks for empty DataFrames both before and after transposing, ensuring a safe operation when handling the quantile calculation.
