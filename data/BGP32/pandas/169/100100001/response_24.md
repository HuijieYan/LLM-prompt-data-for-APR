### Analysis:
The buggy function is `quantile` in the `pandas/core/frame.py` file. The function is intended to return values at the given quantile over the requested axis, either row-wise or column-wise, for a DataFrame. The function calculates quantiles based on the specified parameters like `q`, `axis`, `numeric_only`, and `interpolation`.

### Error Location:
The error in the buggy function is likely related to the `_get_numeric_data` method and the condition check for `is_transposed`. The issue seems to arise when all columns are dropped during the `_get_numeric_data` operation, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by the DataFrame `df` containing only date values with no numeric columns. When calling `df.quantile(0.5)`, the function internally checks for numeric data, but since there are no numeric columns, it might result in unexpected behavior, leading to failing tests.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the quantile calculation works correctly even when all columns are dropped during the operation. One approach could be to handle the case when no numeric data is present by returning an empty Series or DataFrame based on the `q` parameter.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `quantile` function:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if self._get_numeric_data().empty:
        if isinstance(q, (float, int)):
            return pd.Series([], name=q)
        else:
            return pd.DataFrame([])

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed)

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

By checking for empty numeric data early in the function and returning appropriate empty Series or DataFrame, we can handle the edge case where all columns are dropped, allowing the function to behave as expected and pass the failing test.
