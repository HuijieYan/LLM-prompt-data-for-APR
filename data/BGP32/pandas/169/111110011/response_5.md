## Analysis:
1. The provided buggy function is a part of the DataFrame class within the pandas library.
2. The `quantile` function is supposed to return values at the given quantile over a requested axis, similar to the behavior of a Series object.
3. The error occurs when running a specific test (`test_quantile_empty_no_columns`) which involves creating a DataFrame with datetime data and calling the `quantile` function without any columns.
4. The error message indicates a ValueError related to concatenation arising from the `_concat_compat` function.
5. The GitHub issue titled "DataFrame Quantile Broken with Datetime Data" highlights the exact problem we are encountering, indicating that the DataFrame behavior is not consistent with that of a Series when handling datetime data.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `_concat_compat` function being called with an empty array as one of the arguments during processing of datetime data in the DataFrame. This behavior triggers a ValueError since concatenation with no arrays is not allowed.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the operation of the `quantile` function on DataFrame objects aligns with the behavior expected from a Series when dealing with datetime data. This involves handling the case where the DataFrame is empty or contains datetime data correctly to prevent errors during concatenation.

## Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
import numpy as np

class DataFrame(NDFrame):
    # Existing code for the DataFrame class

    def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
        self._check_percentile(q)
    
        data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
        axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
        is_transposed = axis == 1
    
        if is_transposed:
            data = data.T
    
        if data.empty:
            return self._constructor(result)
    
        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
        )
    
        if result.ndim == 2:
            result = self._constructor(result)
        else:
	        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)
	    
        if is_transposed:
	        result = result.T
	
	    return result
```

In the corrected version:
- We have added a check for an empty DataFrame (`data.empty`) to handle the case where the DataFrame does not contain any data.
- By returning the DataFrame construction directly in the case of an empty DataFrame, we prevent the concatenation errors that were occurring.
- This change ensures that the `quantile` function behaves correctly even with an empty DataFrame or datetime data.

By applying these modifications, the corrected `quantile` function should now pass the failing test case and address the issue reported on GitHub.
