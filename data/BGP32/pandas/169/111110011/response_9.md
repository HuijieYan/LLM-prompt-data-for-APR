### Analyzing the Buggy Function and Failing Test

The buggy function in the `DataFrame` class is the `quantile` function. This function calculates the quantile values for the DataFrame along the specified axis. The failing test `test_quantile_empty_no_columns` creates a DataFrame with datetime data and attempts to calculate the quantiles, but it fails with a `ValueError`.

### Error Location and Cause

The error seems to occur in the `_concat_compat` function inside the `pandas.core.dtypes.concat` module, specifically at the line where concatenation is attempted using NumPy's `np.concatenate` function. The error message indicates a `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate`, which suggests that the function receives an empty list of arrays, causing it to fail.

The issue seems related to handling datetime data in the quantile function, as datetime data may not be handled properly during the internal concatenation process.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when the DataFrame contains datetime data correctly during the quantile calculation process. This should involve ensuring that the data is correctly handled and represented as arrays for processing. 

### Corrected Function Implementation

Here is the corrected version of the `quantile` function that should address the issue:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if not self._get_numeric_data().empty:
        data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    else:
        data = self

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

After implementing this corrected version of the `quantile` function, the DataFrame should be able to handle datetime data appropriately when calculating quantiles, addressing the issue reported in the failing test.
