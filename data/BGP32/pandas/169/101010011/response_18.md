### Analysis:
- The buggy function `quantile` is defined twice within the `DataFrame` class, the second definition overwrites the first one, leading to unexpected behavior.
- The error message suggests that there is an issue with the concatenation of arrays, which could be attributed to incorrect data handling in the function.
- The corresponding GitHub issue points out that the quantile method with DataFrame raises a `ValueError`, while it works fine with Series.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the double definition of the `quantile` method within the `DataFrame` class. The second definition does not perform the necessary data handling for DataFrames when calculating the quantile, leading to incorrect results and triggering a `ValueError` during array concatenation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the duplicate definition of the `quantile` method and ensure that the correct data handling is implemented for DataFrames to calculate the quantile properly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.
    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, interpolation=interpolation, is_transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected version removes the duplicate `quantile` method and ensures appropriate data handling for DataFrames, fixing the bug and preventing the ValueError during array concatenation.
