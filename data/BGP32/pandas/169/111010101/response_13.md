### Analysis
The buggy function `quantile` is throwing a `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate` error during test execution. This error occurs when trying to concatenate empty arrays, suggesting that the data being processed in the function is empty or missing.

The function is expected to calculate quantiles over a given axis in a DataFrame. The relevant inputs to the function are `self` (a DataFrame), `q` (a quantile value or array), `numeric_only` (a boolean), `axis` (an integer), and `interpolation` (a string representing the interpolation method).

The bug seems to be related to the input DataFrame not containing any data or being handled improperly, leading to the error when trying to compute quantiles.

### Bug Cause
The bug likely originates from possibly losing data during the processing steps, resulting in empty arrays / data structures. In this case, the error occurs specifically during concatenation operations.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the data processing steps retain the necessary data structures and prevent any cases where empty data structures are used in operations. This can involve proper handling of missing data, ensuring correct axis processing, and verifying data integrity.

### Corrected Function
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)
    
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1
    
    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T
    
    if data.size == 0:  # Check if data is empty
        raise ValueError("Input data is empty, unable to compute quantiles")
    
    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )
    
    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)
    
    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T
    
    return result
```

This corrected version of the `quantile` function includes a check for empty data before performing computations, ensuring that the operations are only carried out on valid data. It prevents the `ValueError` by raising a more informative error message if the input data is empty.
