### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `quantile` method of the `DataFrame` class in the Pandas library. The error message indicates a `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate`. This error suggests that the code is trying to concatenate empty arrays, which should not occur normally during the quantile operation.

The function tries to calculate quantiles over a specific axis but encounters issues due to empty or missing dataframes or arrays. This could be related to empty data columns or issues with the construction of the `BlockManager`.

### Bug Location:
The bug seems to be located in the following section of the buggy code:
```python
result = data._data.quantile(
    qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
)
```
The issue seems to arise from the process of quantile calculation using `data._data`, leading to the `ValueError`.

### Bug Explanation:
The issue arises when the `data` object becomes empty due to operations like transposing it without any columns. This emptiness is carried forward and causes problems when trying to calculate the quantile, leading to the concatenation error.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the situation where the `data` object becomes empty to prevent the concatenation error. This can be achieved by adding a check before performing the quantile operation to ensure that there is at least one column of data available for calculation.

### Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected version of the `quantile` method:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if data.empty:
        return pd.Series() if np.isscalar(q) else pd.DataFrame()

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )
    
    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

The code now checks if the `data` object is empty before proceeding with the quantile calculation. If the data is empty, it returns an empty Series or DataFrame depending on the type of `q` provided, preventing the concatenation error.
