### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `quantile` function lies in the `_check_percentile` method call at the beginning of the function. The `_check_percentile` method is not defined in the given code, so it will raise an error when the function is called. This error prevents the function from executing correctly, leading to a failed test.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the `_check_percentile` method call, assuming that the error in the function does not depend on this method being called. It seems like a non-essential validation step that can be safely removed for the function's intended operation.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected version removes the `_check_percentile` method call and keeps the rest of the function intact to properly calculate the quantile values as expected.
