### Analysis:
The buggy function `quantile` is designed to return values at the given quantile over the requested axis. The function appears to fetch numeric data based on the `numeric_only` parameter and then calculates the quantile using the `quantile` method of the internal data.

The potential location of the bug might be in the calculation and handling of transposed data. It seems that the logic for transposing the data might be incorrect, leading to unexpected results when calculating the quantile.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug likely occurs due to incorrect transposition of the data for quantile calculation. This results in the returned DataFrame being empty when it should contain the calculated quantiles.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the data manipulation logic, particularly the handling of transposed data, is correct. Ensuring that the transposed data is handled properly before calculating the quantile should resolve the issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    if is_transposed:
        result = data._data.quantile(q=q, axis=0, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=False)   
        result = result.T
    else:
        result = data._data.quantile(q=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=False)

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    return result
```

This corrected version ensures that the data transposition is handled correctly before calculating the quantile, addressing the bug identified in the original function.
