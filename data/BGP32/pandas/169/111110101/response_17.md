### Bug Explanation
The `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate` error occurs because the DataFrame `data` ends up with empty columns after being transposed. This leads to an empty operation when trying to compute the quantile, resulting in the error during concatenation.

The bug is essentially caused by the transposition of the DataFrame in the wrong context, leading to the DataFrame having empty columns incorrectly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the transposition is handled correctly based on the input axis. If the axis is 1 (or 'columns'), the DataFrame should be transposed; otherwise, it should retain its original shape. This modification should prevent the DataFrame from having empty columns and resolve the concatenation issue.

### Corrected Function
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)
    
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1
    
    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T
    
    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )
    
    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)
    
    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T
    
    return result
```

Applying this correction, the function should now correctly handle the axis transposition and avoid the issue of empty columns leading to the concatenation error. This corrected version should pass the failing test and provide the expected output values for both cases.
