To identify potential errors in the buggy function provided, we need to analyze it step by step:

1. The function `quantile` takes several parameters such as `q`, `axis`, `numeric_only`, and `interpolation` for calculating quantiles.
2. The function first checks the percentiles provided using the private method `_check_percentile`.
3. It then determines whether to use numeric data only based on the `numeric_only` parameter.
4. The axis along which to calculate the quantiles is determined and if it is transposed, the data is transposed accordingly.
5. The actual quantile calculation is performed using the `_data.quantile` method.
6. Depending on the dimensionality of the result, a DataFrame or Series object is returned.
7. If the data was transposed earlier, the result is transposed back before returning it.

From the above steps, we can see a potential bug in the function's logic. The bug lies in the line where `axis` is redefined based on whether the data is transposed. This possible cause of the bug is leading to incorrect quantile calculations.

To fix the bug, we should keep track of the original axis before potentially transposing the data. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over the requested axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    q : float or array-like, default 0.5 (50% quantile)
        Value between 0 <= q <= 1, the quantile(s) to compute.
    axis : {0, 1, 'index', 'columns'} (default 0)
        Equals 0 or 'index' for row-wise, 1 or 'columns' for column-wise.
    numeric_only : bool, default True
        If False, the quantile of datetime and timedelta data will be
        computed as well.
    interpolation : {'linear', 'lower', 'higher', 'midpoint', 'nearest'}
        This optional parameter specifies the interpolation method to use,
        when the desired quantile lies between two data points `i` and `j`:

        * linear: `i + (j - i) * fraction`, where `fraction` is the
          fractional part of the index surrounded by `i` and `j`.
        * lower: `i`.
        * higher: `j`.
        * nearest: `i` or `j` whichever is nearest.
        * midpoint: (`i` + `j`) / 2.

    Returns
    -------
    Series or DataFrame

        If ``q`` is an array, a DataFrame will be returned where the
          index is ``q``, the columns are the columns of self, and the
          values are the quantiles.
        If ``q`` is a float, a Series will be returned where the
          index is the columns of self and the values are the quantiles.

    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In this corrected version, we retain the original axis value and use it consistently for calculating quantiles. This modification should resolve the bug in the function.
