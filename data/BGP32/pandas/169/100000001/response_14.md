1. Analyze the buggy function:
The buggy function is a method within the Pandas library written in Python that calculates the quantiles of a DataFrame or Series object. The function takes several parameters such as q (quantile(s) to compute), axis (whether to calculate row-wise or column-wise), numeric_only (if False, computes quantile for datetime and timedelta data as well), and interpolation method.

2. Identify potential error locations within the buggy function:
One potential error location in the function is the way the quantile computation is being handled based on the 'is_transposed' variable. The logic for transposing the DataFrame and the subsequent calculation of quantiles based on the transposed data might be causing issues.

3. Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function:
The bug may arise from incorrect handling of transposed data during quantile computation, leading to incorrect results or unexpected behavior.

4. Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the transposition of data and subsequent quantile calculations are handled correctly. This can involve verifying the data orientation before calculating quantiles and appropriately transforming the data if required.

5. Corrected version of the function:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=1 if is_transposed else 0, interpolation=interpolation)
    
    # Reverting the transposed data
    if is_transposed:
        result = result.transpose()

    return result
```
In this corrected version, the data is directly transposed if 'is_transposed' is True, and the quantile calculation is done accordingly. After computing the quantiles, the transposed data is reverted back to its original orientation if it was transposed before the calculation. This ensures that the quantiles are correctly calculated based on the provided parameters.
