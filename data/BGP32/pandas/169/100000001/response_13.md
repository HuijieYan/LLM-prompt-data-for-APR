### Analysis:
The buggy function `quantile` is intended to return values at the given quantile over a specified axis in a DataFrame. However, there are potential errors in this function that need to be addressed. The cause of the bug could be related to the `axis` parameter handling and the transposed data manipulation.

### Identified Issues:
1. The `axis` parameter handling might have issues as the axis is being transposed without properly handling it.
2. The conditional check for `is_transposed` might not be correctly determining the data orientation.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the function is likely caused by incorrect handling of transposed data. The function transposes the data based on the `axis` parameter but may not handle it correctly, leading to issues in the final result.

### Proposed Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the data is transposed correctly based on the `axis` parameter and consider the dimensionality of the resulting data. By correctly handling the transposed data and ensuring the appropriate orientation, we can avoid the bug in the function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation
    )

    if result.ndim == 1:
        if isinstance(q, (int, float)):
            result = pd.Series(result, index=self.columns)
        else:
            result = pd.DataFrame(result, index=q, columns=self.columns)
    else:
        result = self._constructor(result)

    return result
```

In the corrected version, the handling of transposed data is simplified by using the `axis` parameter directly without checking for transposed orientation separately. Additionally, the dimensionality of the result is properly handled to return either a Series or DataFrame based on the input `q`. This should address the issues in the original buggy function and provide the expected output.
