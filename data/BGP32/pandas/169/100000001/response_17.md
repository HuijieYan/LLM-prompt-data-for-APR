The bug in the `quantile` function lies in the logic related to transposing the data when the `axis` is specified as 1. The issue arises when trying to handle transposed data and compute the quantile accordingly. 

The bug occurs due to incorrectly handling the transposed data in the calculation of quantiles. When the `is_transposed` flag is set, the function should transpose the data appropriately and calculate the quantile along the correct axis. However, the current implementation does not handle this scenario correctly, leading to incorrect quantiles being calculated on the transposed data.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust how the data is transposed and how the quantile is computed based on the specified axis. By correctly transposing the data and calculating the quantile along the appropriate axis, we can ensure the function returns accurate results for both row-wise and column-wise quantiles.

Here is the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T
        axis = 0  # Adjust axis for calculating quantiles

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected version, we adjust the `axis` parameter when transposing the data to ensure that the quantile calculation is performed correctly along the appropriate axis. This adjustment resolves the bug and ensures that the function calculates quantiles accurately for both row-wise and column-wise operations.
