## Analysis:
The buggy function is intended to calculate the quantile values over a specified axis in a DataFrame. The function takes several parameters such as `q` (quantile value), `axis` (specifying the axis for calculation), `numeric_only` (to include non-numeric data), and `interpolation` (method for interpolation between data points).

## Potential Errors:
1. The `_check_percentile` method called in the function might contain an error related to percentile validation.
2. The calculation of `data` based on the `numeric_only` parameter may not work as intended.
3. The `is_transposed` variable assignment and transposing of data could lead to incorrect results.
4. Specifying the `axis` incorrectly could result in unexpected behavior.
5. Incorrect usage of attributes or methods related to DataFrame data manipulation.

## Bug Cause:
The bug could potentially arise from incorrect handling of transposed data in the calculation, issues with percentile validation, and incorrect usage of the DataFrame attributes and methods.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure correct handling of transposed data, validate the percentile values properly, and ensure the correct DataFrame attributes and methods are utilized for data manipulation.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.
    """
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data.quantile(
        q=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation
    )

    return result
```

In the corrected version:
- Removed the `_check_percentile` method as its implementation is not provided.
- Updated the calculation of `data` based on the `numeric_only` parameter to match the correct logic of acquiring numeric data.
- Adjusted the calculation of quantile values by using the `quantile` method directly on `data` DataFrame.
- Simplified the return statement to return the calculated `result`.

Ensure to test the corrected function with various scenarios to verify its functionality and accuracy.
