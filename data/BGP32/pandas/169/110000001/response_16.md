There are several potential error locations within the `quantile` function:
1. The `_check_percentile` method is called but not defined within the `DataFrame` class.
2. The `_get_numeric_data` method is called with a condition on `numeric_only` parameter but is not implemented.
3. The `_get_axis_number` method is called but not defined within the `DataFrame` class.
4. The `self._constructor` and `self._constructor_sliced` methods are used but not defined within the `DataFrame` class.

The cause of the bug is that these necessary methods are not defined within the `DataFrame` class, causing the function to throw errors or not work as intended.

To fix the bug, we need to implement these missing methods within the `DataFrame` class. We also need to ensure that the `quantile` function is using the correct methods from within the class.

Here is a corrected version of the `quantile` function with placeholder implementations for the missing methods:

```python
class DataFrame(NDFrame):
    # other class methods...
    
    def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
        """
        Corrected version with placeholder implementations for missing methods.
        """
        # Placeholder implementation for _check_percentile method
        def _check_percentile(self, q):
            pass
        
        # Placeholder implementation for _get_numeric_data method
        def _get_numeric_data(self):
            return self._data.select_dtypes(include=[np.number])
        
        # Placeholder implementation for _get_axis_number method
        def _get_axis_number(self, axis):
            return 0 if axis in [0, 'index'] else 1
        
        self._check_percentile(q)
        
        data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
        axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
        is_transposed = axis == 1
        
        if is_transposed:
            data = data.T
        
        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
        )
        
        if result.ndim == 2:
            result = self._constructor(result)
        else:
            result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)
        
        if is_transposed:
            result = result.T
        
        return result
```

This corrected version provides placeholder implementations for the missing methods within the `DataFrame` class. The actual implementations should be based on the requirements of the class and the functionality needed for the `quantile` function to work correctly. It is recommended to fill in these placeholders based on the actual requirements of the `DataFrame` class.
