The bug in the provided `quantile` function is due to a logic error in handling datetime data when computing quantiles for a DataFrame. The function assumes that the result will always have dimensions 2 when computing quantiles, leading to a concatenation error.

To fix the bug:
1. We need to modify the logic that handles the transposed DataFrame to ensure the correct data orientation.
2. Ensure that the result's dimensions are handled correctly based on whether the quantile operation should return a DataFrame or a Series.

Here is the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis != 0

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=0 if is_transposed else 1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result, index=data.columns)
    else:
        result = result.rename(q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In this corrected version:
- The `axis` check has been corrected to set `is_transposed` when the axis is not 0.
- The `result.ndim` check has been updated to correctly handle whether to return a DataFrame or a Series.
- The `result` DataFrame is created using `_constructor` with an explicit indexing.
- The result is renamed if it's a Series to ensure the correct index value.

By making these changes, the `DataFrame` quantile function should now correctly handle datetime data and return the expected output, as requested in the GitHub issue.
