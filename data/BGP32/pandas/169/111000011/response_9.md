## Analysis:
- The buggy function is a method within the DataFrame class of the pandas library.
- The function is intended to calculate quantiles for the DataFrame object.
- The issue reported on GitHub relates to the quantile function not working correctly for DataFrame objects containing datetime data.
- The bug seems to be related to the concatenation of arrays when calculating quantiles.

## Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs when the DataFrame contains datetime data.
- The _data attribute of the DataFrame object is used to calculate quantiles.
- In the case of datetime data, the underlying array storage and concatenation seem to fail.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the calculation of quantiles for DataFrame objects with datetime data works correctly.
- This may involve handling the specific data types and storage mechanisms for datetime objects.
- The underlying array concatenation or reduction process might need to be adjusted to handle datetime objects correctly.

## Fixed Version:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    # Check if quantiles are valid
    self._check_percentile(q)

    # Get data based on numeric_only option
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self

    # Get the axis number
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    # Calculate quantile based on the data
    if is_transposed:
        result = data.apply(lambda x: np.percentile(x.values, q, interpolation=interpolation))
    else:
        result = data.apply(lambda x: np.percentile(x, q, interpolation=interpolation))

    return result
```

In this corrected version:
- We use the apply method to calculate quantiles for each column of the DataFrame.
- np.percentile is used to calculate the quantile of the values in each column.
- This approach ensures that the quantile calculation process is applied correctly for datetime data as well.
