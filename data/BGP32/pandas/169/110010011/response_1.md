## Analysis:
The buggy function is the `quantile` method in the `DataFrame` class of the `pandas.core.frame` module. The error message indicates that there is a problem with concatenation due to not having at least one array to concatenate. This issue was documented on GitHub under a specific bug related to DataFrame Quantile being broken specifically with datetime data.

## Error Location:
The error seems to be related to a concatenation operation within the `quantile` method, where `np.concatenate(to_concat, axis=axis)` is being called, but `to_concat` seems to be empty.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the fact that the DataFrame contains datetime data. The DataFrame is expected to return the same result as a Series, but the internal concatenation is leading to an error due to the empty array, which is the case when dealing with datetime data.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, one approach could be to handle datetime data differently when computing quantiles. This might involve adjusting the logic inside the `quantile` method to properly process datetime values and avoid the concatenation issue when dealing with empty arrays.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)
        
    if not self.empty:  # Check if the DataFrame is not empty
        data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
        axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)

        is_transposed = axis == 1

        if is_transposed:
            data = data.T

        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
        )

        if result.ndim == 2:
            result = self._constructor(result)
        else:
            result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

        if is_transposed:
            result = result.T

        return result
    else:
        # Return an empty DataFrame if the original DataFrame is empty
        return self._constructor()  # Construct a new empty DataFrame
```

In the corrected version, an additional check is introduced to verify if the DataFrame is empty before performing any computations. If the DataFrame is empty, an empty DataFrame is returned to avoid the concatenation issue.

This correction should resolve the bug and make the `quantile` method work correctly even with datetime data in the DataFrame.
