### Analysis:
- The buggy function `quantile` in the `DataFrame` class is supposed to return values at the given quantile over the requested axis.
- The issue identified in the GitHub report is related to the function failing when operating on datetime data within a DataFrame, while it works fine with a Series.
- The error occurs at a point where concatenation is expected to take place but fails due to the absence of necessary arrays to concatenate.

### Potential Error Locations:
- The error may be caused by the handling of datetime data within the DataFrame during quantile calculations.
- The issue could be related to the internal data structure of the DataFrame when dealing with datetime values.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug is caused by the DataFrame's quantile function not handling datetime data properly, leading to a ValueError when attempting to concatenate arrays that do not exist.
- This bug is specific to datetime data and does not occur with numerical data, which could be due to the internal representation of datetime values within the DataFrame structure.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the quantile function in the DataFrame class can handle datetime data correctly.
- This may involve updating the internal data handling logic in the quantile function to properly deal with datetime values and avoid the concatenation error.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `quantile` function in the `DataFrame` class:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(q=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed)

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result, index=data.index, columns=data.columns)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected version should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug, enabling the `quantile` function to handle datetime data within a DataFrame correctly.
