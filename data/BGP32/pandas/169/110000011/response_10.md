## Analysis:
The issue mentioned on GitHub highlights a problem in the `quantile` function of the `DataFrame` class in pandas. The bug occurs when trying to calculate quantiles for a DataFrame containing datetime data, leading to a `ValueError` due to an attempted concatenation operation.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The issue might arise from the conversion of datetime data within the DataFrame to quantiles.
2. There could be an inconsistency in handling datetime data within the `_get_numeric_data()` method.

## Cause of the Bug:
The error occurs because the DataFrame is not handling datetime data properly when calculating quantiles. The method `_get_numeric_data()` might be excluding datetime data inadvertently, leading to an empty array when trying to concatenate the results of quantiles.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that datetime data is properly included and handled when calculating quantiles. The issue might be resolved by modifying how datetime data is treated within the `_get_numeric_data()` method.

## Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.
    """

    self._check_percentile(q)

    # Get data (including datetime) based on numeric_only flag
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self.copy()

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    # Transpose the data for quantile calculation
    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data.apply(lambda x: x.quantile(q, interpolation=interpolation))

    # Construct the result DataFrame or Series appropriately
    if isinstance(q, (list, np.ndarray)):
        result = result.T
    else:
        result = result.rename(name=q)

    return result
```

In this corrected version:
- We ensure that datetime data is included in the `data` based on the `numeric_only` flag.
- Instead of using `_data.quantile()` for calculation, we use `data.apply()` to calculate quantiles on each column.
- The resulting DataFrame or Series is constructed based on the input `q`.

This corrected version should address the issue reported on GitHub and handle datetime data correctly when calculating quantiles for a DataFrame.
