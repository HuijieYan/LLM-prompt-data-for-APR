### Analysis:
The buggy function `quantile` in the `DataFrame` class of `pandas/core/frame.py` is designed to return values at the given quantile over the requested axis. The issue reported on GitHub states that the `quantile` function runs into an error when dealing with datetime data in a DataFrame.

### Error Locations:
1. The error occurs during the execution of the `quantile` function, specifically when trying to concatenate the data.
2. The issue seems to arise when both the input data and the resulting data are transposed.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by not handling datetime data correctly during the quantile calculation, leading to an error when concatenating the data. This issue needs to be addressed to make the function work seamlessly with datetime data in DataFrames.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, the `quantile` function should be updated to handle datetime data properly during the quantile calculation, making sure the concatenation operation works seamlessly in all scenarios, including cases where the data is transposed.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `quantile` function in the `DataFrame` class:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In this corrected version, the `axis` parameter is used in the calculation without hardcoded values, ensuring the data concatenation issue is properly handled during the quantile calculation process, especially when dealing with datetime data.

This should address the bug reported on GitHub, allowing the `quantile` function to work correctly with datetime data in DataFrames without encountering the concatenation error.
