## Analysis

### Buggy Function
The buggy function is the `quantile` method in the `DataFrame` class. The method aims to return values at the given quantile over the requested axis.

### Test Case
The failing test case `test_quantile_empty_no_columns` creates a DataFrame with dates and attempts to calculate the quantile but encounters an error during the concatenation operation.

### Potential Error Locations
1. The method `_get_numeric_data()` that retrieves the numeric data.
2. The concatenation operation using `np.concatenate()` that seems to cause the error during DataFrame creation.
3. Any mismatch between the data format expected and the actual data during the computation might lead to the error.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is likely caused by the DataFrame creation process inside the `quantile` method. The error message indicates an issue with concatenating arrays, which suggests that the underlying data structures being concatenated are empty or of incompatible types.

The failing test case provides input where the DataFrame only has date columns, which might not align with the internal computation expectations of the `quantile` method, leading to the concatenation issue.

## Suggested Fix
1. Check the logic for handling empty or incompatible data types during quantile computation.
2. Ensure that the data remains consistent throughout the quantile calculation process.
3. Adjust any transformations or data retrievals to handle edge cases like a DataFrame with empty content.
4. Consider providing logic for handling specific data types when empty or with minimal data.

## Correction of the Bug

Below is the corrected version of the `quantile` method that aims to address the issues identified:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)
    
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    if data.empty:
        if isinstance(q, list):
            result = pd.DataFrame([], index=q, columns=[])
        else:
            result = pd.Series([], index=[], name=q)
    else:
        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
        )

        if result.ndim == 2:
            result = self._constructor(result)
        else:
            result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected version first checks if the DataFrame is empty and adjusts the return data accordingly to prevent any issues related to empty or incompatible data formats. It ensures that the result structure aligns with the expected output for both Series and DataFrame cases.
