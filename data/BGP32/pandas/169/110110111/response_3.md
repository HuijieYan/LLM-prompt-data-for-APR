## Analysis
1. The buggy function `quantile` is a method of the `DataFrame` class in the `pandas` library.
2. The failing test in `pandas/tests/frame/test_quantile.py` tries to call the `quantile` function on an empty DataFrame created from a date range.
3. The failing test triggers a `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate`.
4. The function is designed to calculate quantiles on DataFrame columns, but the issue arises when operating on date data.
5. The expected outputs in the failing test are an empty Series and an empty DataFrame for different quantile values.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the quantile function fails to handle date data correctly, causing the internal data operations to throw an error during concatenation. The issue specifically arises when the DataFrame has only date columns.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic to correctly handle date data during the calculation of quantiles. By checking the underlying data types and appropriately returning empty Series or DataFrames, we can ensure that the function behaves as expected.

Here is the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    if data.empty:
        if isinstance(q, list):
            return pd.DataFrame([], index=q, columns=[])
        else:
            return pd.Series([], index=[], name=q)

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the fixed version, we explicitly handle the case where the DataFrame is empty due to having only date data, returning empty Series or DataFrames as expected by the failing test cases.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the quantile function work appropriately on DataFrames with date data columns.
