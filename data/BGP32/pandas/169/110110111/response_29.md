The bug in the `quantile` function seems to arise from the construction of an empty DataFrame when no numeric data is present to compute the quantile. This leads to issues with array concatenation operations.

### Cause of the Bug
1. The function receives a DataFrame `df` with the column name "captain tightpants" and dates populated in the DataFrame.
2. However, the DataFrame only contains datetime data, which leads to `numeric_only` remaining as `True`.
3. When the quantile is calculated with these settings, the function attempts to create an empty DataFrame which results in an error during concatenation since there are no numeric columns to operate on.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the behavior of the function when dealing with non-numeric data. A suitable solution is to return an empty Series or DataFrame depending on the input.

### Corrected Version of the `quantile` Function
Here is the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis_number = self._get_axis_number(axis)

    # If there is no numeric data, return an empty Series
    if data.empty:
        if isinstance(q, float):
            return pd.Series(name=q)

        columns = pd.Index(data.columns, name=self.columns.name)
        return pd.DataFrame(index=q, columns=columns)

    is_transposed = axis_number == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In this corrected version, we handle the scenario where the DataFrame contains no numeric data by directly returning an empty Series if a `float` quantile is specified, or an empty DataFrame if a list of quantiles is provided.

This adjustment should resolve the issue described in the failing test and address the problem reported in the GitHub issue related to quantiles with datetime data.
