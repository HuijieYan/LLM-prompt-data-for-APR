To fix the bug in the `quantile` function, we need to address the issue where the function encounters an error due to concatenating empty arrays. This is causing the ValueError indicating the need for at least one array to concatenate.

One approach to fixing this bug is to handle the scenario where there is no data to compute the quantile for. We can check if the DataFrame is empty and return an empty Series or DataFrame accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if self.empty:
        return pd.Series() if isinstance(q, (float, int)) else pd.DataFrame()
    
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This modification checks if the DataFrame is empty before performing any calculations related to quantile computation. If the DataFrame is empty, it returns an empty Series or DataFrame based on the type of `q` provided.

By making this change, the function will now handle the scenario of an empty DataFrame correctly and avoid the ValueError raised due to attempting to concatenate empty arrays.

This correction should resolve the error encountered in the failing test case provided, as well as address the issue described in the GitHub bug report related to DataFrame quantile computation with datetime data.
