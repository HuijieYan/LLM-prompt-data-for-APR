The bug in the provided `quantile` function seems to be related to the handling of datetime data within a DataFrame when calculating the quantile. The error message indicates that the function is failing when attempting to concatenate data values, probably due to the conversion of datetime data into arrays for calculation.

### Error Identification:
1. The `self._get_numeric_data()` method is being used to filter out numeric data.
2. For datetime data, `numeric_only` is set as True, but later `self` is used, which includes datetime data as well.
3. The concatenation error might be related to the conversion of datetime data into arrays unexpectedly.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when the quantile method is called on a DataFrame that contains datetime data; this situation isn't handled correctly within the function. The usage of `_get_numeric_data()` to filter out numeric data is not sufficient to exclude datetime data, leading to unexpected behavior when calculating quantiles on mixed data types.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, the function should be updated to properly handle datetime data within the DataFrame. One potential solution is to filter out datetime data correctly based on the `numeric_only` flag and ensure that the correct data is passed for concatenation and quantile calculation.

### Corrected Version:
Here is a corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)
    
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self.select_dtypes(include='number')
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1
    
    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T
    
    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )
    
    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)
    
    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T
    
    return result
```

In the corrected version, `select_dtypes(include='number')` is used to filter out numeric data correctly, addressing the issue related to datetime data causing the concatenation error. This change should resolve the bug and allow the quantile function to handle mixed data types within DataFrames correctly.
