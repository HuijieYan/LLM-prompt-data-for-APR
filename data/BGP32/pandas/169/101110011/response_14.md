## Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `quantile` within the `DataFrame` class in the `pandas/core/frame.py` file. It is supposed to calculate quantiles over a specified axis.
   
2. The error message states `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate`, indicating a concatenation issue that arises during the quantile calculation process.

3. The failing test `test_quantile_empty_no_columns` in `test_quantile.py` creates a DataFrame with dates and attempts to calculate quantiles, triggering the bug.

4. The GitHub issue titled "DataFrame Quantile Broken with Datetime Data" reflects a similar problem with quantile calculations using DateTime data, highlighting the need for fixing the concatenation issue.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs due to the logic inside the `_get_numeric_data()` method that could result in dropping all columns when the DataFrame does not contain numeric data. This leads to an empty dataset, causing issues during concatenation later in the quantile calculation.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To address this bug, we need to ensure that the DataFrame does not end up with an empty dataset after extracting numeric data. One way to fix this would be to handle the case where all columns are dropped, ensuring that at least one array is present for concatenation.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self if not numeric_only else self._get_numeric_data()

    if data.empty:
        raise ValueError("No numeric data available for quantile calculations")

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected version:
- We explicitly check if the DataFrame is empty after extracting numeric data.
- If the DataFrame is empty, a `ValueError` is raised to handle this scenario.
- By ensuring that at least one array is present, we avoid the concatenation issue.
- The rectified version is expected to calculate quantiles correctly, addressing the bug.
