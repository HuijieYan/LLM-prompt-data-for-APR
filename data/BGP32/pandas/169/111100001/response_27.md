### Analysis:
1. The provided code snippet is part of the `pandas` library, specifically the `DataFrame` class within the `pandas/core/frame.py` file.
2. The `quantile` function within the class is intended to return values at the given quantile over the requested axis.
3. The bug appears to be related to handling an empty DataFrame and not correctly returning the expected output.
4. The `_check_percentile` function is called within the `quantile` function to validate the input quantile `q`.
5. The function then obtains the numeric data in `data` based on the `numeric_only` parameter and the axis number.
6. The transposition is handled based on the axis selection, and the quantile computation is performed.
7. Finally, the result is restructured as a Series or DataFrame and returned after appropriate handling based on the transposition.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by a misinterpretation of the expected behavior when dealing with an empty DataFrame. It seems that the function does not handle this scenario correctly, leading to a mismatch between the result and the expected output in the failing test case provided.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `quantile` function handles the case of an empty DataFrame appropriately. This can be achieved by adding a check for an empty DataFrame at the beginning of the function and returning an empty DataFrame or Series as the output.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.
    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if self.empty:
        if isinstance(q, (float, int)):
            return pd.Series([], name=q)
        elif isinstance(q, list):
            return pd.DataFrame([], index=q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

By adding a check for an empty DataFrame at the beginning of the function and returning the appropriate empty Series or DataFrame, the corrected version should now handle the failing test case appropriately.
