### Analysis:
The buggy function in the `DataFrame` class is the `quantile` method. It is intended to return values at the given quantile over a requested axis. The bug seems to be related to handling cases where the DataFrame has no columns.

### Error Location:
The bug occurs in the `quantile` function when trying to calculate the quantile but fails to correctly handle the case when the DataFrame has no columns.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be caused by the `quantile` function not handling the scenario when the DataFrame has no columns. This results in unexpected behavior and causes the failing test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `quantile` function to gracefully handle the case when the DataFrame has no columns. We should check for this scenario and return appropriate results to ensure the function behaves as expected.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `quantile` method in the `DataFrame` class. It includes a check to handle the situation when the DataFrame has no columns:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if data.empty:
        if isinstance(q, list):
            return pd.DataFrame([], index=q, columns=[])
        else:
            return pd.Series([], index=[], name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

By adding a check for an empty DataFrame before performing the quantile calculations, we ensure that the function handles this scenario correctly and returns the expected results.

This corrected version of the `quantile` function should now pass the failing test mentioned.
