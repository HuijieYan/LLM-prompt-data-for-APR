### Analysis:
The buggy function `quantile` in the `DataFrame` class is supposed to return values at the given quantile over the requested axis. The bug seems to be related to the data handling and axis transposition logic in the function.

### Error Locations:
1. The use of `axis=1` in the call to `data._data.quantile` seems to be incorrect.
2. The logic for transposing the data and handling the result needs to be reviewed.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be caused by incorrect handling of axis transposition and data processing in the `quantile` function. This leads to incorrect results being returned for quantile calculations, especially when dealing with an empty DataFrame.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the processing logic for quantile calculations based on axis.
2. Ensure correct handling of empty DataFrames.
3. Review the transposition logic for the data.

### Corrected Version of the `quantile` Function:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation='linear'):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T
        axis = 0  # Correct the axis in case of transposition

    result = data._data.quantile(q=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed)

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result, index=data.index, columns=data.columns)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, index=data.columns, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

By making these corrections, the `quantile` function should now handle quantile calculations correctly, especially in cases where the DataFrame is empty or when dealing with transposed data.
