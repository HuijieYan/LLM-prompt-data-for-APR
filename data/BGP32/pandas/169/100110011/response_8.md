### 1. Analysis:
- The buggy function is `quantile` in the `pandas/core/frame.py` file.
- The failing test `test_quantile_empty_no_columns` is located in `pandas/tests/frame/test_quantile.py`.
- The error message indicates a `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate`.
- The GitHub issue #23925 complains about the `DataFrame.quantile` behavior with datetime data not being on par with the behavior of `Series`.

### 2. Potential Error Locations:
- The error seems to occur when attempting to concatenate empty arrays.
- The issue may arise from handling cases when the DataFrame has all columns dropped during processing.
- Potential issues may be in the data retrieval and processing stage of the function.

### 3. Cause of the Bug:
- The code fails to handle the case where all columns are dropped during data processing, leading to an attempt to concatenate empty arrays.
- This issue disrupts proper data processing and results in the `ValueError` during concatenation.
- The GitHub issue highlights that the DataFrame behavior is inconsistent with the Series behavior when handling datetime data.

### 4. Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to:
- Ensure that the function can handle cases where all columns are dropped or the DataFrame is empty.
- Handle the situation where no data remains after filtering or processing to avoid concatenating empty arrays.
- Compare the behavior of `DataFrame.quantile` with `Series.quantile` to ensure consistency, especially with datetime data.

### 5. Corrected Version of the Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    if data.empty:
        return self._constructor()

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

By checking and returning an empty DataFrame early in the function, we prevent erroneous attempts to concatenate empty arrays, resolving the issue observed in the failing test and the reported GitHub bug #23925.
