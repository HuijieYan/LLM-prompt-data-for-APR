The bug in the provided function lies in the calculation of the 'result' variable. The 'axis' parameter is incorrectly used in the quantile calculation, which leads to incorrect dimensionality of the resulting variable. The 'transposed' parameter also appears to be wrongly assigned based on the 'axis' value.

To fix this bug, the 'axis' parameter should be appropriately utilized when calling the 'quantile' function and the 'transposed' parameter should be set based on the 'axis' value.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 0

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected version fixes the bug by adjusting the use of the 'axis' parameter and 'is_transposed' variable according to the correct logic. It ensures that the quantile calculation occurs correctly and that the dimensionality of the resulting variable is maintained as expected for both cases provided.
