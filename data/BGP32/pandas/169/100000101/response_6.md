### Analysis:
- The function `quantile` is intended to calculate the quantiles of the data in a DataFrame based on the parameters provided.
- The bug seems to be related to the handling of the DataFrame and its columns during the quantile calculation process.
- The function correctly checks the percentiles `q` but encounters issues with transposing the data and fetching the correct axis for quantile calculation.

### Bug Cause:
1. The function wrongly transposes the data when `axis` is set to `1`, which can lead to incorrect quantile calculations.
2. The function doesn't handle the case when `q` is provided as a list correctly, resulting in unexpected behavior.

### Bug Fix:
1. Ensure that the transposition of data is handled correctly depending on the `axis` parameter value.
2. Update the logic to handle the case when `q` is provided as a list and adapt the calculation accordingly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over the requested axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    q : float or array-like, default 0.5 (50% quantile)
        Value between 0 <= q <= 1, the quantile(s) to compute.
    axis : {0, 1, 'index', 'columns'} (default 0)
        Equals 0 or 'index' for row-wise, 1 or 'columns' for column-wise.
    numeric_only : bool, default True
        If False, the quantile of datetime and timedelta data will be
        computed as well.
    interpolation : {'linear', 'lower', 'higher', 'midpoint', 'nearest'}
        This optional parameter specifies the interpolation method to use,
        when the desired quantile lies between two data points `i` and `j`:

        * linear: `i + (j - i) * fraction`, where `fraction` is the
          fractional part of the index surrounded by `i` and `j`.
        * lower: `i`.
        * higher: `j`.
        * nearest: `i` or `j` whichever is nearest.
        * midpoint: (`i` + `j`) / 2.

    Returns
    -------
    Series or DataFrame

        If ``q`` is an array, a DataFrame will be returned where the
          index is ``q``, the columns are the columns of self, and the
          values are the quantiles.
        If ``q`` is a float, a Series will be returned where the
          index is the columns of self and the values are the quantiles.
    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data.quantile(
        q=q, interpolation=interpolation, axis=int(not is_transposed)
    )

    if isinstance(q, list):
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected function addresses the issues with transposing the data and handling `q` as a list. It dynamically adjusts the quantile calculations based on the provided parameters.
