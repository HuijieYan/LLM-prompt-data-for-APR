The bug in the provided function lies in the `_check_percentile` method call, which is not defined within the function. This leads to an error when trying to run the function.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the `_check_percentile` method call since it is not necessary for the functionality of the `quantile` function. We can directly proceed with the remaining logic of the function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

With this corrected version, the function should successfully handle the expected input cases provided, producing the expected output and fulfilling the requirements of the function.
