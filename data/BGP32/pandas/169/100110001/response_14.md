### Analysis:
- The buggy function is the `quantile` method within the `pandas.core.frame` module.
- The failing test is `test_quantile_empty_no_columns` from the test file `pandas/tests/frame/test_quantile.py`.
- The error message indicates a `ValueError` related to concatenation, specifically mentioning the need for at least one array to concatenate.

### Bug Identification:
- The bug likely stems from the fact that the function is trying to concatenate empty arrays, leading to the `ValueError`.
- The issue may be in the calculation or creation of the `result` variable within the `quantile` function.

### Bug Explanation:
- The failing test initializes a DataFrame `df` with a single column of date values.
- This DataFrame is then quantiled using `df.quantile(0.5)`, which attempts to calculate the quantile but encounters a `ValueError`.
- The concatenation error suggests that the function is trying to concatenate empty arrays, which is likely due to either the data being empty or the result being empty.

### Bug Fix:
- To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the data or the result is empty in the `quantile` function.
- Specifically, we should check if the `data` or `result` is empty before any concatenation operation is performed.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    if data.empty:  # Check if data is empty
        result = None
    else:
        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
        )

    if result is not None and result.ndim == 2:  # Check if result is not None and has 2 dimensions
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected version includes handling for the scenario where the data is empty to avoid the concatenation error. By checking if the `data` is empty before attempting calculations, we ensure that only valid data is processed.
