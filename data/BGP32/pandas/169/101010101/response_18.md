### Analysis
The buggy function is the `quantile` function within the `DataFrame` class of the Pandas library. The function is intended to return values at the given quantile over a requested axis. The function takes parameters such as `q`, `axis`, `numeric_only`, and `interpolation`. The code tries to compute quantiles based on the input parameters but encounters an error during execution.

The failing test `test_quantile_empty_no_columns` provides an empty DataFrame with no columns, which may have led to the error during execution.

### Bugs in the Code:
1. The function does not handle the case where the DataFrame has no columns.
2. When extracting numeric data using `_get_numeric_data()`, it may return an empty DataFrame if no numeric data exists, leading to errors in subsequent operations.
3. The bug may be linked to processing when empty DataFrames are being transposed or manipulated.

### Bug Strategy:
To handle the case of an empty DataFrame, a check should be added to verify if the DataFrame has any columns before proceeding with quantile computation. Additionally, the code should handle the presence of empty DataFrames when attempting to extract numeric data or perform operations.

### Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected version of the `quantile` function within the `DataFrame` class:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if not self.columns.empty:
        data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
        axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
        is_transposed = axis == 1

        if is_transposed:
            data = data.T

        if not data.columns.empty:
            result = data._data.quantile(qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed)

            if result.ndim == 2:
                result = self._constructor(result)
            else:
                result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

            if is_transposed:
                result = result.T
        else:
            result = data

    else:
        result = self.copy()

    return result
```

This corrected code includes checks to handle the case where the DataFrame has no columns, ensuring that the quantile computation is performed correctly. It prevents errors that may occur due to empty DataFrames during numeric data extraction and operations.

By fixing these issues, the corrected code should now pass the failing test and satisfy all the expected input/output values.
