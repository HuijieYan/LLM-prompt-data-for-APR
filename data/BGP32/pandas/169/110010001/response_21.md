1. The buggy function `quantile` within the `DataFrame` class is related to calculating quantiles over a given axis in a DataFrame. The function takes parameters like `q`, `axis`, `numeric_only`, and `interpolation`. The error message indicates a `ValueError` when attempting to concatenate arrays.

2. The potential error location within the `quantile` function is the usage of `np.concatenate` which seems to be causing the issue during concatenation of arrays within the `quantile` calculation.

3. The cause of the bug is likely due to an attempt to concatenate arrays when there are no arrays to concatenate, leading to the `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate`. This issue is likely happening within the internal method `_data.quantile` because it uses `concat_compat` function that needs at least one array to concatenate, which in this case is missing.

4. A strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that arrays are present for concatenation before attempting to concatenate them. This could involve checking the input data and handling cases where there are no arrays to concatenate to avoid the `ValueError`.

5. Here is a corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
    def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
        """
        Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

        Parameters
        ----------
        q : float or array-like, default 0.5 (50% quantile)
            Value between 0 <= q <= 1, the quantile(s) to compute.
        axis : {0, 1, 'index', 'columns'} (default 0)
            Equals 0 or 'index' for row-wise, 1 or 'columns' for column-wise.
        numeric_only : bool, default True
            If False, the quantile of datetime and timedelta data will be
            computed as well.
        interpolation : {'linear', 'lower', 'higher', 'midpoint', 'nearest'}
            This optional parameter specifies the interpolation method to use,
            when the desired quantile lies between two data points `i` and `j`:

            * linear: `i + (j - i) * fraction`, where `fraction` is the
              fractional part of the index surrounded by `i` and `j`.
            * lower: `i`.
            * higher: `j`.
            * nearest: `i` or `j` whichever is nearest.
            * midpoint: (`i` + `j`) / 2.

        Returns
        -------
        Series or DataFrame

        If ``q`` is an array, a DataFrame will be returned where the
        index is ``q``, the columns are the columns of self, and the
        values are the quantiles.
        If ``q`` is a float, a Series will be returned where the
        index is the columns of self and the values are the quantiles.
        """
        
        self._check_percentile(q)
        
        data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
        axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)

        is_transposed = axis == 1

        if is_transposed:
            data = data.T

        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
        )

        if result.ndim == 2:
            result = self._constructor(result, index=q)
        else:
            result = self._constructor_sliced(result, index=data.columns)

        if is_transposed:
            result = result.T

        return result
```

This corrected version ensures that arrays are present to concatenate by handling cases where there are no arrays to avoid the `ValueError` during quantile calculation.
