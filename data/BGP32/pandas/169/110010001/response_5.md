1. The buggy function is the `quantile` method within the `DataFrame` class. The error message indicates a `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate`.

2. Potential error location: The error is likely happening within the `quantile` function where `data._data.quantile()` is invoked. 

3. Cause of the bug: The error message suggests that there are no arrays to concatenate, which indicates that the `data` object might be empty or does not contain valid data for calculations. This could be due to incorrect processing of the data within the function.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug: We need to ensure that the `data` object has valid data for quantile calculations. This involves checking the condition where the `data` object is empty or missing data.

5. Corrected version of the `quantile` method:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)
    
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1
    
    if data.empty:
        raise ValueError("No data available for quantile calculations")
    
    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T
    
    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )
    
    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)
    
    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T
    
    return result
```

In the corrected version, we have added a check to ensure that if the `data` object is empty, a `ValueError` is raised indicating that there is no data available for quantile calculations. This modification should prevent the `ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate` that was occurring due to empty data.
