## Analysis
The buggy function `quantile` in the `DataFrame` class of the pandas library is used to return values at the given quantile over the requested axis. The issue reported on GitHub relates to `quantile` behaving differently when applied to a Series containing datetime data compared to a DataFrame containing datetime data.

## Bug Location
The bug is likely located in the section where the `quantile` function calculates the quantiles for the DataFrame, particularly when dealing with datetime data. The error is likely due to the handling of datetimes or a mismatch in data processing between Series and DataFrame.

## Cause of the Bug
The error occurs due to the internal processing when calculating quantiles on datetime data within a DataFrame. The mismatch in behavior compared to quantiles on a Series is causing the bug.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, ensure that the internal processing logic for calculating quantiles on a DataFrame with datetime data aligns with the behavior of quantiles on a Series with datetime data. The data conversion or processing within the DataFrame's `quantile` function needs to be adjusted to handle datetime data appropriately.

## Corrected Version
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    # Ensure datetime data is correctly handled for quantile calculation
    if isinstance(data.dtypes, pd.DatetimeTZDtype):
        data = data.to_numeric()

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected version includes an appropriate conversion of datetime data within the DataFrame to handle quantile calculations effectively. The adjustment ensures that the internal processing logic aligns with the behavior expected for datetime data.
