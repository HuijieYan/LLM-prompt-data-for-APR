### Analysis:
1. The buggy function "quantile" in the DataFrame class is supposed to return values at the given quantile over the requested axis.
2. The bug appears to be related to handling DataFrame objects with datetime data when calling the quantile method.
3. The failing test "test_quantile_empty_no_columns" specifically addresses a scenario where all columns are removed due to the "_get_numeric_data()" method, causing the buggy behavior in the quantile function for datetime data.
4. The GitHub issue "DataFrame Quantile Broken with Datetime Data" also highlights a similar problem with the quantile method when working with datetime data.
  
### Error Location:
- The issue seems to be happening when handling the transposed data and resulted in a concatenation error. This error occurs when there are no columns left after the "self._get_numeric_data()" operation.
- The constructor method for creating the intermediate result might be a point of concern.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by a failure to handle an edge case where all columns are removed during the internal processing in the quantile function, especially with datetime data.
- When there are no columns left, the code runs into a concatenation error because it expects at least one array to concatenate but finds none.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, you need to ensure that the code gracefully handles the scenario where all columns are removed during the internal processing.
- Specifically, the code should cater to cases where no data is available for calculation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if not data.empty:
        if is_transposed:
            data = data.T

        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
        )

        if result.ndim == 2:
            result = self._constructor(result)
        else:
            result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

        if is_transposed:
            result = result.T
    else:
        if isinstance(q, (int, float)):
            result = pd.Series([])
            result.index.name = data.columns.name
        else:
            result = pd.DataFrame(columns=data.columns, index=q)
            result.columns.name = data.columns.name

    return result
```

By incorporating the above changes, the corrected version of the quantile function should now handle the scenario where all columns are removed gracefully. This fix should resolve the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue related to the bug.
