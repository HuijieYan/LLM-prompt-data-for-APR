The bug in the provided `quantile` function arises from potential issues with the `data._data` method call within its body. This method is involved in obtaining the quantiles, and the error message indicates a problem related to concatenation when no data is obtained. 

The cause of this bug can be traced to an attempt to concatenate empty data arrays in certain scenarios, leading to a ValueError due to the lack of any arrays for concatenation.

To fix this bug, the function's code should be revised to handle cases where no data is retrieved correctly without attempting to concatenate empty arrays.

Here is the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation='linear'):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    if data.empty:  # Check if the data is empty
        result = self._constructor_sliced(np.nan, name=q, index=data.columns.copy())
    else:
        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
        )

        if result.ndim == 2:
            result = self._constructor(result)
        else:
            result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

By performing a check for `data.empty` before attempting to calculate quantiles, empty data scenarios are handled appropriately, preventing the error from occurring.

This revised version should address the bug and ensure that the `quantile` function works correctly, passing the failing test and satisfying the expected input/output values and types.
