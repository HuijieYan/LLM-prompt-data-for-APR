### Analysis:
1. The buggy function in the provided `DataFrame` class is defined as `quantile`, which is supposed to calculate the quantile over a specified axis for a given DataFrame.
2. The error occurs specifically when the DataFrame is consisting of datetime values, causing an issue with performing the quantile operation.
3. The function checks if `numeric_only` is set to `True` to filter out non-numeric columns for performing the quantile operation.
4. The bug seems to arise from the way datetime values are handled within the quantile computation, leading to the ValueError when attempting to concatenate the results.
5. The failing test case specifies an edge case where the DataFrame has datetime values and expects the quantile result to be empty.
6. The expected cases include corner cases requiring correct handling of non-numeric data within the DataFrame.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to the improper handling of non-numeric data (specifically datetime values) during the quantile computation, leading to a concatenation error when building the result.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to enhance the functionality related to handling non-numeric data (like datetime) inside the `quantile` function. We should adjust the code to properly account for such data types and prevent errors during computation.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `quantile` function that addresses the issue associated with datetime data:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation='linear'):
    self._check_percentiles(q)
    
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1
    
    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T
    
    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )
    
    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)
    
    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T
        
    if numeric_only:
        return result
        
    # Handle specifically for non-numeric data types in result
    if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
        result = result.where(~result.isin([pd.Timestamp, pd.Timedelta]), np.nan)
    else:
        result = np.nan if isinstance(result, (pd.Timestamp, pd.Timedelta)) else result
    
    return result
```

By including the proper handling for non-numeric data types, the corrected function should now handle datetime values appropriately and prevent concatenation errors during quantile calculation. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and handle the datetime-related quantile computations correctly.
