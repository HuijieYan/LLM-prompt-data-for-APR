## Analysis
The `quantile` function in the `DataFrame` class has been defined twice with the same signature, which is causing the bug. When a method is redefined with the same name, the latter definition overwrites the former, leading to only the second definition being considered. This is why the function is failing as it is not executing the intended logic.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the redundant definition of the `quantile` function.

## Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `DataFrame` class with the redundant definition removed:

```python
class DataFrame(NDFrame):
    def _constructor(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
        """
        Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.
    
        Parameters, Returns and Examples remain the same as before.
        """
        self._check_percentile(q)
    
        data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
        axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
        is_transposed = axis == 1
    
        if is_transposed:
            data = data.T
    
        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
        )
    
        if result.ndim == 2:
            result = self._constructor(result)
        else:
            result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)
    
        if is_transposed:
            result = result.T
    
        return result
```

With this fix, the redundant definition has been removed, and the correct `quantile` function will now execute as intended. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the failing test case `test_quantile_empty_no_columns` passes as expected.
