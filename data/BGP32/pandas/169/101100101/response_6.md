### Bug Explanation

The bug in the provided function `quantile` arises from using the incorrect axis value when calling the `data._data.quantile` method. The function is passing `axis=1` unconditionally to the `quantile` method, which causes issues when the input DataFrame has been transposed due to the condition `is_transposed`.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct axis value is passed to the `quantile` method based on whether the DataFrame has been transposed or not. If the data has been transposed, the axis should be set to 0. Additionally, we need to handle the case where `q` is a list to return a DataFrame instead of a Series.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T
        axis = 0  # Adjust axis value when data is transposed

    result = data._data.quantile(q=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed)

    if isinstance(q, list):  # check if q is a list
        result = self._constructor(result, index=q)  # return DataFrame with specified index
        result.columns = self.columns
    else:
        if result.ndim == 2:
            result = self._constructor(result)
        else:
            result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

The corrected version of the function includes the necessary adjustments to handle the axis value correctly based on whether the data is transposed or not. It also ensures that when `q` is a list, a DataFrame is returned with the specified index values. This should resolve the bug and make the function work correctly for both single and multiple quantile values.
