There are multiple issues in the buggy function:

1. The `_check_percentile` function is called but not defined or referenced in the given code.

2. The `self._get_numeric_data()` function is being called, but it might drop all columns due to the nature of the input DataFrame in the failing test. This could lead to unexpected behavior.

3. The `qs=q` argument in `data._data.quantile()` should be replaced with `q=q` to correctly pass the quantile values.

4. The handling of transposed data in the function might not be working as expected, leading to incorrect outputs.

To fix these issues and provide a corrected version of the function, we need to address the following:

1. Ensure that `_check_percentile` function is defined and handles the input parameters properly.

2. Instead of relying solely on `_get_numeric_data()`, we should check if the data contains any numeric values and adjust the processing accordingly.

3. Correct the argument name in the `data._data.quantile()` function.

4. Modify the handling of transposed data to ensure consistent behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    data = self.select_dtypes(include=['number']) if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        q=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected version should address the issues and pass the failing test cases with the expected input/output values.
