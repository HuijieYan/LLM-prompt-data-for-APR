### Analysis:
The buggy function `quantile` in `pandas/core/frame.py` is causing an issue when trying to calculate the quantile of datetime data in a DataFrame. The error raised is related to the concatenation of arrays, indicating that there is an issue with converting datetime data into arrays for computation.

### Error Location:
The error lies in the data conversion step where datetime data is being handled incorrectly, resulting in the concatenation error. More specifically, the issue occurs when the DataFrame contains datetime values, and the quantile function fails to process them correctly.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is that the current implementation of the `quantile` function in pandas does not properly handle datetime data in DataFrames. When attempting to compute the quantile of datetime data, the conversion process to arrays is failing, resulting in the concatenation error.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that datetime data is correctly handled when computing quantiles. This involves checking the data type and handling datetime and timedelta values differently than numeric data during the quantile computation.

### Corrected Code:
I have provided a corrected version of the `quantile` function below:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    if data._is_mixed_type:
        if not numeric_only:
            data = data.select_dtypes(exclude='datetime')
            numeric_only = True
        else:
            data = self.select_dtypes(include='datetime')

    result = data._data.quantile(qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed)

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

The corrected code snippet above addresses the bug by checking for mixed data types (including datetime) and handling them appropriately during the quantile computation. By excluding datetime types if `numeric_only` is set to True and including only datetime types if `numeric_only` is set to False, the bug related to datetime data should be resolved.
