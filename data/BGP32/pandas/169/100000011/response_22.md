### Analysis:
The issue on GitHub highlights that when using the `quantile` method with datetime data in a DataFrame, it raises a `ValueError`, while it works fine with a Series object. This discrepancy is likely due to the implementation within the `quantile` method, specifically handling datetime data with DataFrames. The error seems to be related to the concatenation of data, leading to the `ValueError`.

### Error Locations:
1. The error may occur when handling datetime data during the quantile computation with DataFrames.
2. The calculation might be encountering issues with concatenating the data when working with the DataFrame representation.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the handling of datetime data within the DataFrame when computing quantiles. The concatenation operation in the quantile calculation is likely failing due to the unique structure of DataFrames with datetime data.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the DataFrame quantile computation should be modified to correctly handle datetime data by restructuring the concatenation process and ensuring compatibility with DataFrame representation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile_interpolate(
        qs=q, axis=1 if is_transposed else 0, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim > 1:
        result = self._constructor(result, index=data.columns)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, index=data.columns, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected version of the `quantile` function includes the modification to `quantile_interpolate` method to handle datetime data correctly within DataFrames. The indexing and axes handling have been adjusted to ensure the computation works seamlessly for both Series and DataFrame objects. 

This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to the `quantile` method with DataFrame datetime data.
