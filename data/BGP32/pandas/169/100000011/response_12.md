### Analysis:
The buggy function is `quantile` within the `pandas/core/frame.py` file. The issue reported on GitHub (`DataFrame Quantile Broken with Datetime Data`) describes a problem with the `quantile` method when applied to a DataFrame with datetime data. The function is supposed to calculate quantiles for the data, but it raises a `ValueError` when used with datetime values.

### Error Locations:
1. The error is likely caused by the attempt to concatenate the results within the `quantile` function.
2. The problem might arise from the use of datetime data where concatenation may not be suitable for these types of data.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the implementation does not handle datetime values correctly. The function should be able to handle datetime types appropriately without raising an error during the concatenation process.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to avoid the concatenation of datetime data. Instead, we should adapt the quantile calculation logic to work with datetime types. Any datetime-related computations during quantile calculation should consider the specifics of datetime values.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    if not data.empty and is_datetime_or_timedelta_dtype(data.dtypes).any():
        result = data.quantile(q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed)
    else:
        result = data._data.quantile(q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed)

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected version, we check for datetime or timedelta data types in the DataFrame before performing the quantile calculation to handle these data types appropriately. The code now distinguishes between different data types and adapts the quantile calculation accordingly to avoid the ValueError when working with datetime values.
