**Analysis:**
The buggy function `quantile` in `pandas/core/frame.py` is causing an issue when operating on datetime data in a DataFrame. The error is triggered because the function is trying to concatenate the result of quantile computations carried out on each column of the DataFrame, resulting in a `ValueError`.

**Error Location:**
The error seems to be occurring when the function tries to concatenate the results of quantile computations performed on each column of the DataFrame.

**Cause of the Bug:**
The bug occurs because the `_quantile` method in the `DataFrame` class tries to concatenate the results of quantile computations. Concatenation is not needed in this case when dealing with a DataFrame containing datetime data. The function primarily needs to return the quantile from each column without concatenating them.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the quantile computation is performed column-wise and the DataFrame is returned with quantile values for each column individually. Removing the unnecessary concatenation step should eliminate the `ValueError` issue.

**Corrected Version:**
Here is the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=0, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In this corrected version, the bug is fixed by changing the axis parameter value from `axis=1` to `axis=0` in the `_data.quantile` method call. This change ensures that quantile computation is performed column-wise within each column of the DataFrame without concatenating the results, thus resolving the `ValueError` issue.
