## Analyzing the Buggy Function and GitHub Issue

1. **Buggy Function Analysis**:
   - The `quantile` function in `pandas/core/frame.py` is intended to return values at the given quantile over a requested axis for a DataFrame.
   - The function checks if the operation involves numeric data only and retrieves the numeric data.
   - It then calculates the quantiles, transposing the data if required, and constructs the result DataFrame or Series accordingly.

2. **GitHub Issue Relationship**:
   - The GitHub issue "DataFrame Quantile Broken with Datetime Data" reports that the `quantile` function works fine with a Series of datetime data but raises an error when used with a DataFrame of datetime data.
   - The reported error occurs during concatenation which suggests potential issues in handling datetime data within the function.

## Identifying Potential Error Locations
1. The issue occurs when trying to concatenate blocks during the quantile calculation.
2. The error suggests a problem with handling datetime data within the function, possibly leading to invalid concatenation.

## Cause of the Bug
The function does not account for special handling of datetime and non-numeric data, leading to compatibility issues during internal data operations and concatenation.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Ensure that the function correctly handles non-numeric and datetime data during quantile calculations.
2. Implement a method to differentiate between numeric and non-numeric data to avoid concatenation errors.

## Corrected Version

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis_number = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis_number == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    if not numeric_only:
        data = data.select_dtypes(exclude=["datetime", "timedelta"])

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        return self._constructor(result)
    else:
        return self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)
```

In the corrected version:
1. Check if the data is not numeric and exclude datetime and timedelta data for operations.
2. Return the constructed result based on the outcome of the quantile calculation.

By including proper handling for non-numeric data, this corrected version should resolve the issue when calculating quantiles for DataFrames that contain datetime data.
