### Analysis:
The buggy function is the `quantile` function in the `pandas/core/frame.py` file. The issue reported on GitHub mentions that the `DataFrame.quantile()` method is broken when used with datetime data, unlike the working behavior with Series.

### Error Locations:
1. The `quantile` method attempts to use the `_get_numeric_data` method to filter the DataFrame for numeric data, which may exclude datetime data causing the concatenation error.
2. The usage of `transposed=is_transposed` in the `quantile` calculation might be causing issues with multi-dimensional data.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the method `_get_numeric_data()` excluding datetime data during quantile calculation, leading to an error when concatenating the results. Additionally, the incorrect handling of transposed data contributes to the bug.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the `quantile` method to filter data based on the `numeric_only` parameter without excluding datetime data explicitly.
- Ensure correct handling of transposed data in the quantile calculation to avoid inconsistencies.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if numeric_only:
        data = self.select_dtypes(include=[np.number])
    else:
        data = self._get_numeric_data()

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected version enhances the behavior of the `quantile` method by using `select_dtypes` to filter numeric data without explicitly excluding datetime data. Additionally, it ensures that transposed data is handled correctly during quantile calculation.
