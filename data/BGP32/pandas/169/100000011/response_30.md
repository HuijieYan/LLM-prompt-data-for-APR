### Analysis:
The issue reported on GitHub involves the `DataFrame` quantile method not working correctly with datetime data. When attempting to calculate the quantile of a `DataFrame` that contains datetime data, it raises a `ValueError` related to the concatenation of arrays.

### Error Locations:
1. The error is potentially occurring when trying to concatenate the arrays within the `_concat_compat` function in the `pandas.core.dtypes.concat` module.
2. The issue might be due to the fact that the quantile method was designed to work with numerical data and not datetime data.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the fact that the `quantile` method was not appropriately handling datetime data. The `ValueError` is likely due to an attempt to concatenate non-numeric arrays, which is not supported for datetime data.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the data type before performing any concatenation operations.
2. If the data type is non-numeric (e.g., datetime), handle it separately to calculate the quantile correctly.
3. Update the method to support datetime data by appropriately handling the operation.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `quantile` method with added logic to handle datetime data:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    if not data.select_dtypes(include=['datetime', 'timedelta']).empty:
        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed, datetime=True
        )
    else:
        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
        )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In this corrected version, I added a condition to check if the data includes datetime or timedelta types, and if it does, I pass the additional argument `datetime=True` to the `quantile` function to handle the computation accordingly. This modification should resolve the issue with calculating quantiles for datetime data in DataFrames.
