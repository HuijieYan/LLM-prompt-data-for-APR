### Analysis:
The reported issue on GitHub describes a problem with the `DataFrame.quantile()` method when used on datetime data. The issue occurs due to a `ValueError` when trying to concatenate the data for calculation. The problematic code in the `DataFrame` method is using `data = data.T`, which transposes the data, leading to incorrect processing of datetime data and resulting in the mentioned error.

### Error Location:
The error occurs at `data = data.T` inside the `quantile()` function, specifically when `numeric_only` is set to `True`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of datetime data when transposing the data within the `DataFrame.quantile()` method. Transposed datetime data cannot be concatenated correctly, leading to the `ValueError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the code should avoid transposing the data when dealing with datetime values. Data that is not numeric should not be transposed as the current implementation causes issues with concatenation. The fix involves adjusting the logic to handle transposed data properly.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `quantile()` function that addresses the mentioned bug:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self.copy()

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    return result
```

In the corrected version, `data = self.copy()` is used instead of `data = self._get_numeric_data()` when `numeric_only` is set to `True`. This adjustment ensures that the correct data is retained without triggering the `ValueError` due to improper transposition.

By making this change, the `DataFrame.quantile()` method should now work correctly with datetime data, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
