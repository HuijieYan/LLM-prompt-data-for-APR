### Analysis:
1. The `quantile` function in the buggy code is designed to calculate quantiles for a DataFrame.
2. The issue mentioned on GitHub involves calculating the quantiles for a DataFrame containing datetime data, which raises a `ValueError needing at least one array to concatenate`.
3. The problem seems to stem from how the DataFrame with datetime data is processed within the function.
4. A possible solution involves ensuring that the DataFrame with datetime values is correctly handled and processed to avoid the concatenation error.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because when passing a DataFrame with datetime data to the `quantile` function, the handling of this data is incorrect. It leads to an attempt to concatenate empty arrays, causing a `ValueError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, proper handling of the DataFrame containing datetime data is necessary. This involves making sure that the datetime data is processed correctly before any operations that may lead to concatenation errors.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `quantile` function to address the bug:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 0:
        result = pd.Series(result, index=data.columns)
    else:
        result = self._constructor(result)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected version of the function should handle DataFrame objects with datetime data correctly and calculate quantiles without encountering the concatenation error.
