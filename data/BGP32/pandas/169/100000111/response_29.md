The bug in the provided `quantile` function is related to handling datetime data in DataFrames. The issue is due to the `BlockManager` representation of datetime data causing errors during quantile computation.

The bug is triggered because when extracting numeric data from the DataFrame, the function checks for `Empty DataFrame` conditions. However, in the case of datetime data, the representation in `BlockManager` doesn't reflect as empty, leading to an error in the later part of the function.

To fix this bug, we need to modify how datetime data is handled when extracting numeric data for quantile calculation in DataFrames. We should check for datetime-specific types and handle them appropriately.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    q : float or array-like, default 0.5 (50% quantile)
        Value between 0 <= q <= 1, the quantile(s) to compute.
    axis : {0, 1, 'index', 'columns'} (default 0)
        Equals 0 or 'index' for row-wise, 1 or 'columns' for column-wise.
    numeric_only : bool, default True
        If False, the quantile of datetime and timedelta data will be
        computed as well.
    interpolation : {'linear', 'lower', 'higher', 'midpoint', 'nearest'}
        This optional parameter specifies the interpolation method to use,
        when the desired quantile lies between two data points `i` and `j`:

        * linear: `i + (j - i) * fraction`, where `fraction` is the
          fractional part of the index surrounded by `i` and `j`.
        * lower: `i`.
        * higher: `j`.
        * nearest: `i` or `j` whichever is nearest.
        * midpoint: (`i` + `j`) / 2.

    Returns
    -------
    Series or DataFrame

        If ``q`` is an array, a DataFrame will be returned where the
          index is ``q``, the columns are the columns of self, and the
          values are the quantiles.
        If ``q`` is a float, a Series will be returned where the
          index is the columns of self and the values are the quantiles.
    """

    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only and self.select_dtypes(include=np.number).empty else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected version, we check for the presence of numeric columns before extracting numeric data. This change ensures that datetime and timedelta data are handled correctly in the quantile computation process within DataFrames. The corrected function now properly handles both numeric and datetime data, resolving the bug described in the GitHub issue.
