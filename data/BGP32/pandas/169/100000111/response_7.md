### Issue Analysis:
The bug occurs in the buggy function `quantile` when trying to calculate the quantiles of a DataFrame with datetime data. The issue is triggered by how the function handles datetime data internally, causing a concatenation error.

### Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of datetime data within the `quantile` function.
2. Lack of proper distinction between different data types when performing operations.

### Cause of the Bug:
The function `quantile` does not distinguish between numeric and non-numeric data properly. When the function encounters datetime data, it fails in calculating quantiles due to improper internal operations, leading to the concatenation error.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Differentiate between numeric and non-numeric data explicitly.
2. Handle datetime data separately from other data types to avoid errors during calculations.
3. Ensure that operations within the function are compatible with the DataFrame structure and different data types present in the input.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if self._get_numeric_data().empty:
        axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
        is_transposed = axis == 1

        if is_transposed:
            data = self.T
        else:
            data = self

        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=0, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
        )

        if result.ndim == 2:
            result = self._constructor(result)
        else:
            result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

        if is_transposed:
            result = result.T

        return result
    else:
        return self._get_numeric_data().quantile(q=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation)
```

By correcting the function according to the identified strategy, the issue related to calculating quantiles for datetime data within DataFrames should be resolved. By separating the handling of numeric and non-numeric data, the function will be able to calculate quantiles correctly for various data types.
