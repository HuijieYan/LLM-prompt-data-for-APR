After analyzing the buggy function and the provided GitHub issue, it seems that the bug occurs when the DataFrame contains datetime data. The bug arises due to the incorrect handling of transposed data in the quantile function.

The issue stems from the assumption that transposing the data with `data.T` will provide the expected results for quantile computation. However, when dealing with datetime data, transposing the DataFrame does not handle the datatype properly, leading to errors during the quantile calculation.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust how the transposed DataFrame is handled when calculating the quantile for different data types, especially for datetime data.

Below is the corrected version of the quantile function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T
        # Adjusted handling for datetime data
        if len(data.select_dtypes(include=["datetime64"])) > 0:
            data = data.select_dtypes(include=["datetime64"])

    result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation)

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the issue in handling transposed datetime data during the quantile calculation. It ensures that datetime data is correctly processed before computing the quantile, thus fixing the bug identified in the GitHub issue.
