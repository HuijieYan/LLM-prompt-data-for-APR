## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `quantile` is intended to return values at the given quantile over a requested axis for a DataFrame.
2. The issue is related to the function's handling of datetime data, where it fails to calculate the quantile correctly for datetime data.
3. The failing test case involves calculating quantiles for a DataFrame consisting of datetime values, which leads to errors during concatenation due to incompatible types.
4. The bug arises when the `_get_numeric_data` function is used incorrectly in the function.
5. The bug can be resolved by properly handling datetime data within the DataFrame when calculating quantiles.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of datetime data within the `_get_numeric_data` function for quantile calculations. This leads to errors when trying to concatenate the data due to its object type, resulting in a `ValueError`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug:
1. Check the type of data before performing operations that involve concatenation to avoid errors.
2. Ensure that handling of datetime data is done separately from numeric data within the DataFrame.

## Corrected Function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = self.T
    else:
        data = self

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

By handling the datetime data correctly and avoiding erroneous operations, the corrected function should resolve the issue of computing quantiles for datetime data within a DataFrame.
