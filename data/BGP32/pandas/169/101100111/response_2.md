## Analyzing the Buggy Function

1. The buggy function is `quantile` within the `DataFrame` class of the `pandas` library.
2. The function is responsible for returning values at the given quantile over the requested axis.
3. The main issue lies in the way handling of datetime data is performed within the function.
4. The failing test case involves an empty DataFrame consisting of datetime data causing the function to fail.
5. The expected output is a Series which reflects the quantile calculation as it occurs in the case of a Series object.

## Bug Explanation

1. The failing test case `test_quantile_empty_no_columns` involves an empty DataFrame (`df`) created using `pd.DataFrame(pd.date_range("1/1/18", periods=5))`.
2. The 'quantile' function gets called on this empty DataFrame.
3. When `numeric_only` is `True`, the function expects to handle numeric data and relies on `_get_numeric_data()` to filter out numeric columns.
4. However, with an empty DataFrame containing datetime data, the function fails to handle this data type correctly.
5. The issue arises when trying to concatenate values of datetime data, leading to the error `'ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate'`.

## Strategy to Fix the Bug

To fix the bug, the function `quantile` needs to be modified to handle the case of empty DataFrames with datetime data correctly. This can be achieved by ensuring that the function is able to correctly identify and process datetime columns, which were leading to the concatenation error in the failing test.

## Corrected Version of the Function

Here is the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation='linear'):
    self._check_percentile(q)
    
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if data.empty:  # Check if the DataFrame is empty
        result = self._constructor(result)  # Returning an empty Series/DataFrame
    else:
        if is_transposed:
            data = data.T

        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
        )

        if result.ndim == 2:
            result = self._constructor(result)
        else:
            result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

        if is_transposed:
            result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected version includes a check for an empty DataFrame and handles the datetime data appropriately to prevent the concatenation error. It now returns an empty Series or DataFrame in case of an empty input DataFrame.

By applying this correction, the function should now behave as expected and pass the failing test case while handling datetime data properly.
