### Analysis:
The buggy function `quantile` in the DataFrame class of the pandas library is intended to return values at the given quantile over a requested axis. The function is called with parameters 'q', 'axis', 'numeric_only', and 'interpolation'. The issue appears when the function is called with datetime data, resulting in a ValueError due to improper handling.

### Identified error locations:
1. The function incorrectly handles datetime data, leading to a failed concatenation operation.
2. There is an inconsistency between function calls with a Series and a DataFrame, resulting in different outputs for the same operation.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug arises from the function's inability to handle datetime data properly. When 'quantile' is called with datetime data in a DataFrame, the concatenation operation fails due to the datetime objects. This inconsistency leads to a ValueError, as observed in the failing test case.

### Bug fix strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles datetime data correctly and aligns its behavior with that of the 'quantile' function for Series data. By ensuring consistent handling of datetime data and simplifying the concatenation process, we can resolve the issue.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation='linear'):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    q : float or array-like, default 0.5 (50% quantile)
        Value between 0 <= q <= 1, the quantile(s) to compute.
    axis : {0, 1, 'index', 'columns'} (default 0)
        Equals 0 or 'index' for row-wise, 1 or 'columns' for column-wise.
    numeric_only : bool, default True
        If False, the quantile of datetime and timedelta data will be
        computed as well.
    interpolation : {'linear', 'lower', 'higher', 'midpoint', 'nearest'}
        This optional parameter specifies the interpolation method to use,
        when the desired quantile lies between two data points `i` and `j`:

        * linear: `i + (j - i) * fraction`, where `fraction` is the
          fractional part of the index surrounded by `i` and `j`.
        * lower: `i`.
        * higher: `j`.
        * nearest: `i` or `j` whichever is nearest.
        * midpoint: (`i` + `j`) / 2.

    Returns
    -------
    Series or DataFrame

        If ``q`` is an array, a DataFrame will be returned where the
          index is ``q``, the columns are the columns of self, and the
          values are the quantiles.
        If ``q`` is a float, a Series will be returned where the
          index is the columns of self and the values are the quantiles.
    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

By simplifying the function to only focus on handling numeric data for quantiles and ensuring consistent behavior between Series and DataFrame inputs, the corrected version aims to resolve the issue.
