The bug in the provided function `quantile` stems from the incorrect handling of datetime data within a DataFrame, resulting in an error when the function is called with datetime data. The issue is highlighted in the GitHub post where calling `quantile` on a DataFrame with datetime data results in a `ValueError`.

### Problem Identification:
Upon analyzing the buggy function, the root cause of the bug can be traced to the `_get_numeric_data` method within the `quantile` function. This method filters out non-numeric data, causing issues when applied to datetime values. As a result, the transposition and processing of the data for quantile computation fail when non-numeric datatype columns exist within the DataFrame.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, the function needs to be adjusted to handle datetime data correctly by considering non-numeric columns during quantile computation. By modifying the logic related to data selection before quantile calculation, we can ensure all columns are considered appropriately, leading to the correct quantile output.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation='linear'):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self if not numeric_only else self.select_dtypes(include=[np.number], exclude=[np.datetime64, np.timedelta64])
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed)

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

The corrected function uses `select_dtypes` method to filter only numeric columns, excluding datetime and timedelta columns for quantile computation. This adjustment allows the function to handle datetime data correctly, resolving the bug that caused the error mentioned in the GitHub issue.

By incorporating these changes into the `quantile` function, the corrected version should now pass the failing test case and align with the expected input/output criteria, addressing the reported issue effectively.
