The bug in the provided function `quantile` seems to arise from the handling of empty DataFrames and the logic related to transposing the data. 

1. The function must check for empty DataFrames and handle them appropriately to avoid unexpected behavior.
2. Additionally, the transposing logic needs to be adjusted to work correctly with empty DataFrames and prevent errors during calculations.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic of the function to handle empty DataFrames gracefully and ensure that the transposing operation is only performed on non-empty DataFrames.

Here is the corrected version of the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only and not self._is_empty() else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if not data.empty and is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if not data.empty and is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected version of the function includes checks for empty DataFrames before attempting transposition and adjusts the logic accordingly to handle the edge case of empty DataFrames. By making these adjustments, the function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
