## Analysis
The buggy function `quantile` is intended to return values at the given quantile over a requested axis. The bug occurs when all columns are dropped during the execution, leading to incorrect behavior and failing test cases.

## Error Locations
1. The `data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only` line could be problematic if the columns are dropped completely.
2. The `result = data._data.quantile(qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed)` line could cause issues with the dropped columns.
3. The conditional checks with `is_transposed` might not handle the scenario of all columns being dropped.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling when all columns are dropped from the DataFrame. The function assumes that there is always numeric data to work with, but in the failing test cases, this assumption does not hold, leading to unexpected behavior and failing assertions.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to first check if data is empty after trying to get numeric data. If data is empty, we should handle this edge case gracefully in the function to ensure correct behavior when all columns are dropped.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.
    """
    self._check_percentile(q)
    
    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    
    # Check if data is empty after attempting to get numeric data
    if data.empty:
        if isinstance(q, list):
            result = self._constructor(pd.DataFrame([], index=q, columns=[]))
        else:
            result = self._constructor(pd.Series([], index=data.columns, name=q))
    else:
        axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
        is_transposed = axis == 1
    
        if is_transposed:
            data = data.T
        
        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
        )
    
        if result.ndim == 2:
            result = self._constructor(result)
        else:
            result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)
    
        if is_transposed:
            result = result.T
    
    return result
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly handle the case where data is empty after trying to get numeric data. If data is empty, we construct an empty DataFrame or Series based on the type of `q` and return it accordingly. This ensures that the function behaves correctly even when all columns are dropped.
