## Analysis:
The `pivot` function is designed to pivot a DataFrame based on specified index, columns, and values. However, there are several potential error locations within the function that might be leading to bugs:
1. The handling of `values` when it is None needs to be fixed.
2. The creation of the MultiIndex might not be correct.
3. The conditional statement for selecting the construction of the DataFrame might not be handling all cases properly.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug in the provided `pivot` function occurs when `values` is None. In this case, the function tries to create the pivot using the specified `columns` as the value, but the handling of this scenario leads to incorrect results.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the handling of `values` when it is None and accurately construct the DataFrame in this scenario. Additionally, the creation of the MultiIndex and construction of the final DataFrame should be reviewed to ensure correctness.

## Corrected Version of the `pivot` Function:
```python
# The fixed version of the 'pivot' function
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot"], indents=1)
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if values is None:
        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.set_index(cols, append=append)
    else:
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        else:
            index = data[index]
        index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])

        if is_list_like(values) and not isinstance(values, tuple):
            # Exclude tuple because it is seen as a single column name
            indexed = data._constructor(
                data[values].values, index=index, columns=values
            )
        else:
            indexed = data._constructor_sliced(data[values].values, index=index)
    return indexed.unstack(columns)

```

In the corrected version of the `pivot` function, the handling of `values` when it is None is corrected to use the specified `columns` for pivoting. The construction of the MultiIndex and determining the construction of the DataFrame have been retained to maintain functionality.
