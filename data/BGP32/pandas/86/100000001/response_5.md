## Analysis:
This buggy function `pivot` is responsible for pivoting a DataFrame based on specified index, columns, and values. The function has conditional blocks to handle different cases where values can be specified or not. However, there are potential error locations within the function that could be causing the bug.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The `indexed` variable may not be defined in all code paths within the function.
2. In the block where values are specified, there is a condition checking if `values` is list-like but not a tuple. This condition might not cover all cases.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the function stems from the incomplete definition of the `indexed` variable. Depending on the code path taken in the function, `indexed` might not be properly defined which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors when trying to call methods on it.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, ensure that `indexed` variable is initialized properly in all conditional branches of the function. Additionally, review and refactor the conditions involving `values` to cover all possible scenarios to avoid any unexpected behavior.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot"], indents=1)
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if values is None:
        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.set_index(cols, append=append)
    else:
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        else:
            index = data[index]
        
        index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])
        
        if is_list_like(values) and not isinstance(values, tuple):
            # Exclude tuple because it is seen as a single column name
            indexed = data._constructor(
                data[values].values, index=index, columns=values
            )
        else:
            indexed = data._constructor_sliced(data[values].values, index=index)
    
    if columns is not None:
        return indexed.unstack(columns)
    else:
        return indexed
``` 

In this corrected version, I added a condition at the end to ensure that when columns are not specified, the `indexed` DataFrame is returned as is, without trying to unstack it. I also ensured proper initialization of the `indexed` variable in all code paths.
