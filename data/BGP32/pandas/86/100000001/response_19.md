## Analysis:
The buggy function `pivot` is used for pivoting the data in a DataFrame. The function has three parameters: `index`, `columns`, and `values`, which determine how the data will be reshaped. The bug in the function seems to be related to the way the columns are handled when pivoting the data.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The logic for setting the `index` and `columns` for the DataFrame might be incorrect.
2. The way values are handled and transformed into a DataFrame may be problematic.
3. The unstacking of the DataFrame might not be done correctly.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the function seems to arise from how the `index` and `columns` are set and used in pivoting the data. Additionally, the handling of `values` to create the DataFrame for certain cases seems to be incorrect.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `index` and `columns` are correctly set and used in the pivot operation. Additionally, the handling of `values` needs to be improved to ensure correct creation of the DataFrame. Proper validation of input parameters and handling different cases can help in resolving the bug.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if values is None:
        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.set_index(cols, append=append)
    else:
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        else:
            index = data[index]
        index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])

        if is_list_like(values) and not isinstance(values, tuple):
            # Exclude tuple because it is seen as a single column name
            indexed = data[values].unstack()
        else:
            indexed = data.pivot(index=index, columns=columns, values=values)

    return indexed
```

In this corrected version, I have modified the handling of `values` to form the DataFrame using the `.unstack()` method when `values` is a list. Additionally, I have used the `.pivot()` method for other cases to properly pivot the data based on the input parameters. The function should now work correctly for different scenarios of pivot operations.
