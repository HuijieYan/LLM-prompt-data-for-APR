## Analysis:
This buggy `pivot` function is intended to pivot a DataFrame based on the specified index, columns, and values. The function is supposed to handle various cases such as when `values` are not specified, or when they are specified as a list-like object or a single scalar value.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The check for `values` being `None` might not be handling cases where `values` is provided as a scalar.
2. The logic for constructing the `indexed` DataFrame based on different conditions might be causing issues.
3. The handling of `values` as a list-like object is unclear and could lead to errors.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the original function arises from incorrect handling of the `values` parameter. When values are provided as a single scalar value, the function is unable to construct the indexed DataFrame correctly, leading to errors.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to explicitly handle cases where `values` is a single scalar value and construct the indexed DataFrame accordingly. Additionally, we should ensure that the logic for constructing the `indexed` DataFrame is consistent and correct for different input scenarios.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if values is None:
        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.set_index(cols, append=append)
    else:
        if isinstance(values, str):
            values = [values]

        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        else:
            index = data[index]
        
        index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])

        if is_list_like(values):
            indexed = data._constructor(data[values].values, index=index, columns=values)
        else:
            indexed = data._constructor_sliced(data[[values]].values, index=index)

    return indexed.unstack(columns)
```

In the corrected version above, we handle the case where `values` is a single scalar by converting it into a list before further processing. We also ensure a consistent approach for constructing the `indexed` DataFrame based on different input scenarios.
