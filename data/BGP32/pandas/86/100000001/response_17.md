## Analysis:
The function `pivot` is supposed to reshape the input DataFrame into a new DataFrame with the specified index, columns, and values. However, there are several potential error locations within the function that need to be addressed:
1. The logic for setting up the DataFrame `indexed` based on the input parameters `index`, `columns`, and `values` is not consistent and may lead to incorrect output.
2. There is a condition for handling different types of `values`, but the handling may not be appropriate for all cases.
3. The usage of `MultiIndex.from_arrays` to create the index may not be correct in all scenarios.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the function stems from inconsistent logic and incorrect handling of the input parameters `index`, `columns`, and `values`. The branching conditions do not cover all possible scenarios, leading to potential errors in setting up the DataFrame `indexed`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug in the `pivot` function, it is essential to ensure consistent handling of input parameters and use appropriate methods to create the index. Updating the logic for setting up `indexed` based on the input parameters and refining the conditions for different types of `values` will help address the bug.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if values is None:
        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.set_index(cols, append=append)
    else:
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        else:
            index = data[index]
        
        if is_list_like(values) and not isinstance(values, tuple):
            # Exclude tuple because it is seen as a single column name
            indexed = data[values].unstack(columns)
        else:
            indexed = data.pivot(index=index, columns=columns, values=values)

    return indexed
```

In the corrected version of the `pivot` function:
- The logic for setting up the DataFrame `indexed` has been updated to ensure consistency and correctness.
- The conditional statements for handling different types of `values` have been refined to provide appropriate processing.
- The use of `data[values].unstack(columns)` and `data.pivot()` methods has been modified for better reshaping of the DataFrame.

This corrected version should address the buggy behavior in the original `pivot` function.
