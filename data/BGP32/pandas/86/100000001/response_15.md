## Analysis:
The buggy function `pivot` aims to pivot a DataFrame based on the provided index, columns, and values. It builds a new DataFrame by setting the index and unstacking based on the provided columns.

## Identified Potential Error Locations:
1. The code checks if `values` is None, but does not handle cases where `index` or `columns` are None.
2. When setting the index for the DataFrame, there might be issues with constructing the MultiIndex correctly.
3. Constructing the new DataFrame based on the values might result in errors if `values` is not a list-like object or a tuple.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug in this function arises from two main issues:
1. The handling of the provided `index` and `columns` when `values` is None is incomplete, leading to potential errors in setting the index correctly.
2. There is a lack of proper validation for the `values` input, which can result in issues when constructing the new DataFrame.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that `index` and `columns` are properly handled even when `values` is None.
2. Validate the `values` input to construct the new DataFrame correctly.
3. Improve readability and maintainability of the function to prevent potential bugs.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if values is None:
        if index is None or columns is None:
            raise ValueError("Both index and columns must be specified when values is None")
        
        indexed = data.set_index([index, columns])
    else:
        values = [values] if not is_list_like(values) else values
        index = data.index if index is None else data[index]
        index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])
        
        indexed = data.loc[:, values].set_index(index[:len(values)])
    
    return indexed.unstack(columns)
```

In the corrected version of the function, we ensure that `index` and `columns` are properly handled even when `values` is None. Additionally, we validate the `values` input and construct the new DataFrame accordingly. This improves the functionality and readability of the function, reducing the risk of potential bugs.
