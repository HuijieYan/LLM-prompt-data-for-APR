### Analysis:
The error message indicates a `KeyError` with a value of `None` being raised during the execution of the `get_item` function, which is part of the indexing operation. This suggests that there is an issue with how the `index` and `columns` values are being used in the `pivot` function.

### Error Location:
The error is likely occurring in the line:
```python
index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])
```
where the `index` and `columns` should be valid references to columns in the `data` DataFrame, but there could be a problem with the way these values are being accessed or processed.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by passing the `index` and `columns` arguments incorrectly to the `MultiIndex.from_arrays` function. The `index` is expected to be a valid index for rows in the DataFrame, while `columns` should refer to columns in the DataFrame. 

In the failing test, the `index` is set to `"col1"`, which is a valid column name, but `columns` is not provided, leading to `None` being used as the value for `columns`. This results in `data[columns]` returning `None`, causing the `KeyError` with a value of `None`.

### Strategy for Fixing:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `index` and `columns` arguments passed to the `MultiIndex.from_arrays` function are correctly specified. Additionally, we should handle cases where `columns` is `None` properly.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `pivot` function:

```python
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if values is None:
        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.set_index(cols, append=append)
    else:
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        else:
            index = data[index]

        if columns is None:
            raise ValueError("pivot() missing 1 required argument: 'columns'")
        
        if is_list_like(values) and not isinstance(values, tuple):
            # Exclude tuple because it is seen as a single column name
            indexed = data._constructor(
                data[values].values, index=index, columns=values
            )
        else:
            indexed = data._constructor_sliced(data[values].values, index=index)
            
    return indexed.unstack(columns)
```

In the corrected version, we added a check for the `columns` argument being `None`, and we raise a `ValueError` with a message indicating that the argument is missing. This ensures that the function will not proceed if `columns` is not provided.
