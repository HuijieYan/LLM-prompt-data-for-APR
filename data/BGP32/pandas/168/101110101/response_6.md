Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test, we can identify the cause of the bug:

1. The `key` parameter is expected to be a single key (e.g., a string) in multiple cases, but the bug allows it to be a list of keys. This discrepancy results in a `KeyError` when the function tries to process the key.
2. The function logic is designed to handle a single key but fails for a list of keys.

To fix the bug, we can ensure that the `key` parameter is processed as a single key before proceeding with the rest of the function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        # Process level key
        if isinstance(level, list):
            if len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
            else:
                raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")
        # Process key
        if key is None:
            key = level if is_scalar(level) else group_axis.get_level_values(level)
            level = None

    # Ensure key is a single key, not a list
    if not isinstance(key, str):
        key = key[0]

    # The rest of the function remains unchanged...
}
```

This corrected version ensures that the `key` is passed as a single key rather than a list. This alteration fixes the bug by aligning the function's behavior with the expected input for the `key` parameter.
