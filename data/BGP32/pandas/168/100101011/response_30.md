## Bug Explanation

The bug occurs because the `_get_grouper()` function does not handle the case where the key is a column name correctly when grouping along columns. This leads to a KeyError when trying to group by column name "x".

The issue stems from the logic in the function that checks for different types of keys (callable, array-like, Grouper, etc.) and does not properly handle the case where the key is a column name. This results in the function not recognizing the column name as a valid key for grouping.

## Bug Fix

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_get_grouper()` function to correctly handle column names as keys when grouping along columns. We should check if the key is a column name and then proceed with creating the Grouping objects accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper()` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(obj, key=None, axis=0, level=None, sort=True, observed=False, mutated=False, validate=True):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if level in group_axis.names:
            key = level
            level = None
        # handle the case where level is a list-like object
        elif is_list_like(level):
            if len(level) == 1:
                key = level[0]
                level = None
            else:
                raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

    if isinstance(key, str) and key in obj:
        key = obj[key]

    # rest of the function remains the same

    # return the grouper, exclusions, and obj
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle column names as keys when grouping, addressing the KeyError issue and resolving the bug.

This fix should now allow the test function `test_groupby_axis_1` to run successfully without any errors.
