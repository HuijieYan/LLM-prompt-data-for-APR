### Bug Explanation
The bug lies in the `_get_grouper` function where the key is expected to be either a single key or a list of keys, but the code does not handle the case where a string is passed as the key. This results in an issue when trying to group by columns with a single column name provided as a string.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the code to handle the case where a single column name is passed as a string for grouping along columns.
2. Ensure that the function can differentiate between single keys and lists of keys appropriately.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex) and is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
        level = level[0]

    if key is None and is_scalar(level):
        key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
        level = None

    if isinstance(key, str):
        if axis == 1 and key not in obj.columns:
            raise KeyError(f"Key {key} not found in columns")

    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj
    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj

    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        if key in obj and set(key).issubset(obj):
            msg = (
                "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than "
                "a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In "
                "the future, a tuple will always mean a single key."
            )
            warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
            key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # Handle grouping by a single column name
    if isinstance(key, str):
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = True

    any_callable = any(callable(g) or isinstance(g, dict) for g in keys)
    any_groupers = any(isinstance(g, Grouper) for g in keys)
    any_arraylike = any(
        isinstance(g, (list, tuple, Series, Index, np.ndarray)) for g in keys
    )

    # Remaining code remains the same
```

By updating the function as mentioned above, the bug should be fixed, and the provided test case should pass without any KeyError when trying to group by a single column name.
