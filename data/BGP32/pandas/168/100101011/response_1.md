### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_grouper` is responsible for creating and returning a BaseGrouper, which is a mapping of how to create grouper indexers.
2. The function loops through keys and levels to determine the groupings and exclusions for the BaseGrouper.
3. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles grouping by columns when using `axis=1`.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In the failing test case, when trying to group by columns using `axis=1`, the function fails to correctly handle the grouping by column names.
2. The variable `key` in this case is the string `'x'`, representing the column name, which is not being processed correctly in the function's logic.
3. The function fails to recognize column names for grouping when passing in a string key for columns.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check the condition where the function determines if the key is for a single level or column and adjust the logic accordingly.
2. Ensure that when grouping by columns using `axis=1`, the function correctly processes the column names as keys for grouping.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if not isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if isinstance(group_axis, Index) and level in group_axis.names:
                key = level
                level = None

    if key is not None and isinstance(key, str):
        if key in group_axis:
            key = obj[key]
        else:
            raise KeyError(key)

    # Rest of the function logic remains the same...

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

By updating the logic to handle column names correctly when grouping by columns with `axis=1`, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub post.
