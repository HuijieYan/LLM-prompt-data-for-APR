### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_grouper` is responsible for creating and returning a `BaseGrouper`, which is an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
2. The function attempts to determine the structure of the passed `key` parameter, which can be a single level, a list of levels, a column name, a function, or a Grouper object.
3. The bug occurs when trying to group by column names (`key`) in the case of `axis=1`, where the code incorrectly handles the column name, leading to a KeyError.
4. The bug leads to the failure of the test function `test_groupby_axis_1`, which attempts to group by column names in a DataFrame.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In the provided cases, the value of `key` is `'x'` or `['x']`, representing the column name to group by.
2. The code fails to correctly identify the column name and process it for grouping when `axis=1`.
3. The issue arises in the section where the column name should be matched with the object's columns, but the logic is not handling this correctly, resulting in a KeyError.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic in the section where the `key` parameter, representing the column name, is processed for grouping.
2. Verify that the column name exists in the DataFrame's columns before proceeding with grouping and avoid any unnecessary checks or conversions that might lead to errors.

### Code Fix:
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function to address the bug:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Handling the case where key is a column name for grouping
    if key is not None and not isinstance(key, (Grouper, BaseGrouper)):
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            # Extract the column name from key
            column_name = key if isinstance(key, str) else key[0]
            if column_name not in obj.columns:
                raise KeyError(column_name)
            key = obj.pop(column_name)
            level = None

    # Remaining code for creating the Grouping objects as before

    # return the grouper along with any exclusions and the object
    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

After applying this fix, the function should correctly handle grouping by column names, preventing the KeyError and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
