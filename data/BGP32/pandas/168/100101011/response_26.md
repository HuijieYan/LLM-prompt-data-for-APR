### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `_get_grouper` function in the condition where `is_tuple` is evaluated. The issue arises when the condition is met for `is_tuple`, but the subsequent code block processes the `key` as a list, leading to an incorrect conversion of the `key` variable. This causes a mismatch in handling the `key` parameter, leading to errors in the grouping process.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the handling of the `key` parameter when it is a tuple. Instead of treating it as a list directly, we should extract the elements of the tuple and process them accordingly. This will ensure that the `key` is correctly handled as per the intended behavior.

### Code Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Existing code before bug fix
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        if all_latest(key) and set(key).issubset(obj):
            msg = (
                "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than "
                "a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In "
                "the future, a tuple will always mean a single key."
            )
            warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
            key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # Existing code after bug fix
    
    # Remaining code remains the same

    gpr, level = keys[0], levels[0]  # Update this assignment based on the actual keys and levels processing

    # Loop through remaining keys and levels
    for i in range(1, len(keys)):
        # Process each key and level as needed with the new assignment

    # Existing code after bug fix

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

By fixing the handling of the `key` when it is a tuple, the corrected function should now process the input parameters correctly and generate the desired output for the failing test cases.
