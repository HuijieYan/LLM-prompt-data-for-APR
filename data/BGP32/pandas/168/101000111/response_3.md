Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the provided expected input/output values, it seems that the bug lies in the handling of the `key` parameter. The current implementation does not properly handle the case when a list of keys is provided for grouping by columns.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the handling of the `key` parameter in the `_get_grouper` function to properly support grouping by columns when a list of keys is provided. We should iterate over each key in the list and create Grouping objects accordingly for each column to be grouped.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if key is None:
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")

    if isinstance(key, list):
        groupings = []
        exclusions = []
        
        for k in key:
            if k not in obj:
                raise KeyError(k)
            
            level = None
            gpr = obj[k]
            level = None
            
            if not isinstance(gpr, Grouping):
                grouping = Grouping(
                    group_axis,
                    gpr,
                    obj=obj,
                    name=k,
                    level=level,
                    sort=sort,
                    observed=observed,
                    in_axis=True,
                )
            else:
                grouping = gpr
                
            groupings.append(grouping)
        
        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, exclusions, obj

    # Handle other cases as before
    # ...
```

This corrected version should handle the case of grouping by columns using a list of keys correctly according to the expected input/output values provided. The modifications ensure that each column key in the list is processed individually to create the necessary Grouping objects for grouping purposes.
