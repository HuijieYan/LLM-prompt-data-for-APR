### Bug Explanation
In the buggy function `_get_grouper`, there is a check to determine if the key is in the index of the DataFrame. The issue arises when the key is provided as a list of keys (as in Case 2) rather than a single key. This causes a `KeyError` to be raised when trying to access the key in the DataFrame index.

### Bug Fix
To fix this issue, we need to handle the case when the key is provided as a list of keys. We should iterate over each key in the list and process them individually. Additionally, we need to update the code to account for multiple keys being passed in the `key` parameter. We can modify the section where the key is processed to handle both single keys and lists of keys.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # other parts of the function remain the same
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        groupings = []
        exclusions = []
        for k in key:
            # process each key individually
            # handle key as a single key in this block
            if isinstance(k, str):
                if obj.index.name != k:
                    raise ValueError(
                        f"level name {k} is not the name of the index"
                    )
                gpr = obj[k]  # get the key from the DataFrame
                if is_categorical_dtype(gpr) and len(gpr) != obj.shape[axis]:
                    raise ValueError(
                        ("Length of grouper ({len_gpr}) and axis ({len_axis})"
                        " must be same length".format(
                            len_gpr=len(gpr), len_axis=obj.shape[axis]
                        )
                    )
                groupings.append(
                    Grouping(
                        group_axis,
                        gpr,
                        obj=obj,
                        name=k,
                        level=None,
                        sort=sort,
                        observed=observed,
                        in_axis=True,
                    )
                )
                exclusions.append(k)
            else:
                raise ValueError(f"Invalid key type: {type(k)}")
    else:
        # existing code for a single key
```

By making these changes, the function will be able to handle both single keys and lists of keys appropriately, fixing the bug that caused a `KeyError` when passing a list of keys.
