### Bug Explanation:

The bug in the `_get_grouper` function arises from the code path where a tuple key is processed. When the key is a tuple and not already in the index, the code is supposed to interpret it as a list of keys rather than a single key. However, in the implementation, there is a check to ensure that the key being processed is hashable, which is not the correct condition. This check leads to an incorrect warning being issued and the key being incorrectly converted to a list.

### Bug Fix:

To fix the bug, we need to correct the condition where the key is a tuple. Instead of checking for hashability, we should directly handle cases where the key is a tuple by converting it to a list of keys. This will prevent issuing a misleading warning and ensure that the key is correctly processed as intended.

### Updated `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Previous code remains the same

    if isinstance(key, tuple):  # Correct the handling of tuple key
        if key not in obj and set(key).issubset(obj):
            key = list(key)  # Convert tuple key to list of keys

    # Remaining code remains unchanged
```

By updating the `_get_grouper` function as described above, we ensure that the tuple key is correctly interpreted as a list of keys, resolving the bug in the function.
