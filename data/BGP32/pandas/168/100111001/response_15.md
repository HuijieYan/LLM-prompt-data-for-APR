The bug in the `_get_grouper` function is due to incorrect handling of the `key` parameter when it is a string. The function expects `key` to be a list of keys, but when it is a string, it should be converted to a list containing that single key.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, tuple)):
        key = [key]

    # the rest of the function remains the same from here

    # Code handling the key parameter has been updated to ensure it's a list
    # if it's not already a list or tuple

    # rest of the function stays the same

```

This correction ensures that `key` is always treated as a list, even if it's initially passed as a string. This change should fix the KeyError issue when passing a string as `key`.
