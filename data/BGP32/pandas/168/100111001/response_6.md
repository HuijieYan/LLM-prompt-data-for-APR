### Error Analysis
In both cases, the error occurs when the function tries to handle the key parameter, which is expected to represent the column(s) to group by. The issue is in the part of the code where the function iterates over the keys and processes them to create Grouping objects. The code incorrectly raises a `KeyError` when the key is a string in the list form, such as `['x']`. The function fails to handle this scenario properly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the handling of the key parameter when it is provided as a list of strings. We should treat the list of strings as individual keys to group by and process them accordingly in the loop over keys.

### Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    keys = key if isinstance(key, (list, tuple)) else [key]

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for i, (gpr, level) in enumerate(zip(keys, [level] * len(keys)):    
        exclusions.append(gpr)
        
        ping = (
            Grouping(
                group_axis,
                gpr,
                obj=obj,
                level=level,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                in_axis=True
            )
        )
        groupings.append(ping)

    return BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated), exclusions, obj
```

This corrected version properly handles when the key is provided as a list of strings and creates Grouping objects for each key in the list. This adjustment ensures that the function can correctly group the DataFrame based on the specified keys.

By applying this fix, the function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
