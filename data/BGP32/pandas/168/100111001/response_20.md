### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_get_grouper` function arises from the code block that processes the `key` parameter. When the `key` is provided as a list, the function incorrectly assigns it directly to `keys` without checking if it contains valid groupers. This leads to an issue when processing the `keys` later in the function.

In Case 2, the `key` parameter is provided as `['x']`, which is correctly identified as a list. However, due to the flawed logic in the function, this list is directly assigned to `keys` without appropriate validation. This causes subsequent checks on the type of `key` to fail, resulting in a `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `key` is provided as a list, each element in the list is validated. If all elements in the list are valid keys, they can be assigned to `keys`. Otherwise, an error should be raised.

### Corrected Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
    
    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")
    
            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError("level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level))
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")
            level = None
            key = group_axis
    
    # Process list-like keys
    if is_list_like(key):
        validated_keys = []
        for k in key:
            if isinstance(k, str) and k in obj.columns:
                validated_keys.append(k)
            else:
                raise KeyError(k)
        keys = validated_keys
    else:
        keys = [key]
    
    # Rest of the function remains the same...
```

By validating each element in the `key` list before assigning it to `keys`, we can ensure that only valid keys are processed further in the function, resolving the `KeyError` issue.
