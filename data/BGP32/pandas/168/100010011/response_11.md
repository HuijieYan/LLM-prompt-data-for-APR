### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs when trying to group by columns using the `groupby` function with `axis=1`. The issue arises when passing a single column name as a string or a list containing a single column name. The function raises a `KeyError` indicating that the column name is not found, even though it should be valid.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug is caused by the function incorrectly handling the case when a single column name is passed as a string or within a list. This leads to a situation where the function is unable to properly recognize the column name, resulting in the `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function `_get_grouper` needs to be modified to correctly handle the case where a single column name is passed as a string or within a list when grouping by columns.

### Corrected Code:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # validate that the passed single level is compatible with the passed axis of the object
    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
                
            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")
            
            if isinstance(level, str) and level != obj.columns.name:
                raise ValueError("level name '{}' is not the name of the columns.".format(level))
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")
            level = None
            key = group_axis

    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        ...
    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        ...
    else:
        if not isinstance(key, list) and not isinstance(key, tuple):
            keys = [key]
        else:
            keys = key
        
        # Handling for single column name as string or list with one element
        if not any(isinstance(g, (list, tuple)) for g in keys):
            keys = [keys]
        
        ...

        for i, (gpr, level) in enumerate(zip(keys, levels)):
            ...

``` 

This corrected code snippet should address the issue mentioned in the GitHub report and ensure that when a single column name is passed for grouping by columns, it is handled correctly without raising a `KeyError`.
