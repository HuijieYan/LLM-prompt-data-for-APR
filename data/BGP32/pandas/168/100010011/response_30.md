### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_grouper` is responsible for creating a `BaseGrouper` object for pandas' groupby operation. The error occurs when trying to group by a key that is not found in the object's axis. This error leads to a `KeyError` being raised, indicating that the key provided for grouping is not valid in the context of the operation.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to improper handling of the grouping key when it is a list containing column names. The function expects a key that is hashable and present either in the object or its index. When the key is a list with column names like `['x']`, the function wrongly treats it as a single key rather than a list of keys. This incorrect handling leads to the KeyError.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to properly handle the case when the key is a list of column names. The function should recognize that a list of keys is provided and treat each key in the list separately for grouping.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
    else:
        keys = [key]

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for key in keys:
        if not obj.columns.isin([key]).any():
            raise KeyError(key)

        if is_categorical_dtype(obj[key]) and len(obj[key]) != obj.shape[axis]:
            raise ValueError(
                "Length of grouper ({len_gpr}) and axis ({len_axis}) must be same length".format(
                    len_gpr=len(obj[key]), len_axis=obj.shape[axis]
                )
            )

        ping = Grouping(
            group_axis,
            obj[key],
            obj=obj,
            name=key,
            level=level,
            sort=sort,
            observed=observed,
            in_axis=True,
        )

        groupings.append(ping)
        exclusions.append(key)

    if len(groupings) == 0:
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function properly handles the case when the key is a list of column names. It iterates over each key in the list, checks if it exists in the object's columns, and creates a `Grouping` object for each key for proper grouping.

By making these changes, the function will be able to group by a list of column names when performing the groupby operation, resolving the KeyError issue identified in the GitHub problem description.
