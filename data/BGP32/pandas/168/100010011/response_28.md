### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_grouper` is responsible for creating and returning a `BaseGrouper`, an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers for groupby operations. The bug manifests when trying to group by column names using `groupby(by="x", axis=1).sum()`. The function does not handle the case where a single string key is passed for grouping by column names.

### Issue:
The error occurs when attempting to group by a single column name where the function is expecting a list of keys. This causes a `KeyError` to be raised for the column name.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the case where a single string key is passed for grouping by column names. This involves converting the key into a list when necessary and ensuring that the groupings are correctly created for each key.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if not isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.columns.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "level name {} is not the name of the columns".format(level)
                    )

            key = level
            level = None
        else:
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
            if obj.index.name != level:
                raise ValueError(
                    "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                )

            key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
            level = None

    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj

    elif isinstance(key, (str, int)):
        key = [key]

    # rest of the function remains the same
```

By checking if the `key` is a single string before proceeding and converting it to a list, the corrected function now correctly handles the case of grouping by a single column name. This fix addresses the KeyError issue reported in the GitHub issue.
