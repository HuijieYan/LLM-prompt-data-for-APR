### Bug Analysis:
1. The bug occurs in the `_get_grouper` function where it raises a `KeyError` when trying to group by a single column name.
2. The bug arises due to the condition checking if the provided key is in the object (DataFrame) which is inappropriate for column names.
3. The error stems from the incorrect handling of single column names when grouping along columns.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic to correctly handle grouping by a single column name when `key` is a string.
2. If `key` is a string, directly use the string as the key without checking its presence in the object.
3. Adjust the validation and grouping process to correctly handle single column names.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(key, str):
        return BaseGrouper(group_axis, [Grouping(group_axis, key, obj=obj, in_axis=True)], sort=sort), [], obj

    # remaining code for handling key as Grouper, BaseGrouper, or tuple as before
    # ...

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function now correctly handles grouping by a single column name when the `key` is a string. This change addresses the KeyError issue observed in the failing tests when trying to group by a single column name. It ensures that the function behaves as expected when grouping along columns by a column name.
