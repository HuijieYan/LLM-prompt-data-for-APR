### Analysis:
1. The `_get_grouper` function is intended to create and return a `BaseGrouper`, which is an internal mapping for creating grouper indexers. It handles the logic of extracting key, level, and axis information for grouping.
2. The error occurs when attempting to group by a single column name (e.g., `group_name = 'x'` or `group_name = ['x']`) using the `groupby` function with `axis=1`.
3. The cause of the bug is a KeyError exception raised when attempting to group by a column name. The function was not handling column names correctly due to some conditional logic for handling MultiIndex which caused the KeyError.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies the column names and handles them appropriately.
5. The fix involves modifying the logic related to identifying column names and handling them for grouping.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
    
    # Extract column names if key is a single string or list of strings
    if isinstance(group_axis, DataFrame) and isinstance(key, str):
        if key not in group_axis.columns:
            raise KeyError(key)
        key = group_axis[key]
    
    if isinstance(group_axis, DataFrame) and isinstance(key, list):
        if not all(col in group_axis.columns for col in key):
            raise KeyError(key)
        key = group_axis[key]

    # Rest of the function remains the same...
```

By updating the function logic as shown above, the function will correctly handle the grouping by single or multiple column names when using `axis=1` in conjunction with the `groupby` function. This fix should resolve the KeyError issue when attempting to group by column names.
