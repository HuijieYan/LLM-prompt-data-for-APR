### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_grouper` is responsible for creating and returning a `BaseGrouper` object, which is an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers. The bug occurs when trying to group by column name(s) using the `groupby` function with `axis=1`. The function fails to handle grouping by column names correctly, leading to a `KeyError` for column name(s) causing the test to fail.

### Bug Location
The bug is likely occurring in the section of the code where it checks if the `group_axis` is a `MultiIndex` and decides how to handle the `key` and `level` values for grouping. This part of the code doesn't properly handle column names for grouping by keys.

### Bug Cause
The root cause of the bug is the improper handling of column names when grouping by column(s) using `axis=1`. The function fails to recognize column names correctly, resulting in a `KeyError` when trying to group by columns.

### Proposed Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function `_get_grouper` needs to be modified to correctly handle grouping by column names. Column names should be treated like keys for grouping, similar to how index names are handled. Additionally, the section of the code responsible for identifying the actual grouper should be reviewed to ensure it works correctly for column names.

### Corrected Version of the Function

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
            
            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")
            
            if key is None:
                if isinstance(level, str):
                    key = obj[level]
                elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                    raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")
    
    if isinstance(key, str):
        key = obj[key]

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, [key], sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, [], obj
```

This corrected version of the function should now correctly handle grouping by column names when `axis=1`. This fix ensures that column names are treated as keys for grouping purposes.
