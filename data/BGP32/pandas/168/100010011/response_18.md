### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs when trying to group by column name(s) using `groupby(by="x", axis=1)` in a DataFrame, which results in a KeyError even though the column name(s) are valid. This bug is related to incorrect handling of grouping by column names in the `_get_grouper` function.

### Bug Location:
The bug is likely occurring in the section where the function checks if the passed `key` is in the columns or index names of the DataFrame when grouping by columns. The error message indicates a KeyError when trying to group by the column name 'x'.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by a logic error in the `_get_grouper` function that doesn't handle grouping by column names correctly. It fails to recognize column names as valid keys for grouping by columns.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `_get_grouper` function to correctly handle grouping by column names and ensure that column names are treated as valid keys for grouping by columns.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_grouper` function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
                
            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
                
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if is_list_like(key):
                key = key[0]
            
            if key not in obj.columns:
                raise KeyError(key)

    # rest of the function remains the same

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

By correcting the logic related to grouping by column names within the `_get_grouper` function, we can ensure that the bug causing the KeyError when grouping by column names is resolved.
