## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_grouper` function arises from a mistaken assumption about the structure of the `key` parameter. In the failing tests, the `key` parameter is passed as a list containing a single element, such as `['x']`, but the function incorrectly handles this input.

The function expects `key` to be a single element when checking if `key` is not in `obj`, leading to a `KeyError` since it should be treating `key` as a list in this case. This inconsistency causes the function to raise an error when it checks for the existence of `key`, expecting it to be a non-list element like a string.

## Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly deals with `key` being a list. We should modify the section where `key` is checked for non-existence in `obj` to handle both single elements and list elements appropriately. The key should be treated as a single object only in specific conditions.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Existing code
    
    # Check for non-existence of key in obj
    if (
        isinstance(key, (tuple, list)) and
        all(k not in obj for k in key)
    ):
        msg = (
            "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than "
            "a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In "
            "the future, a tuple will always mean a single key."
        )
        warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
        key = list(key)
    
    # Existing code
    
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This fix ensures that the function handles `key` correctly, whether it is a single element or a list, avoiding the `KeyError` issue when checking for key existence.
