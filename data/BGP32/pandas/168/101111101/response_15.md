Based on the analysis of the provided cases, the issue seems to stem from how the key is handled within the `_get_grouper` function. When the key is a list with a single element, it is not processed correctly, leading to errors.

To address this bug, we need to adjust the handling of the key when it is a list with a single element. Instead of directly assigning `key = group_axis`, we should properly check and extract the key element from the list.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Existing code remains unchanged before below line

    # allow level to be a length-one list-like object
    if is_list_like(level):
        nlevels = len(level)
        if nlevels == 1:
            level = level[0]
        elif nlevels == 0:
            raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
        else:
            raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

    if isinstance(level, str):
        if obj.index.name != level:
            raise ValueError(
                "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
            )
    elif level > 0 or level < -1:
        raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

    if len(key) == 1:
        key = key[0]

    # Rest of the code remains the same...

```

This correction addresses the handling of the key when it is a list with a single element, ensuring that the key is correctly extracted. This change should fix the bug causing the failing tests to occur.
