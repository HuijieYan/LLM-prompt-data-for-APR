## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_get_grouper` function when the input `key` is a string `'x'` or a list `['x']`. The function is designed to handle different types of input keys properly; however, there is an issue when the input key is a list of strings. The current implementation does not correctly account for this scenario, leading to a `KeyError` being raised for the input key `'x'` or `['x']`.

The function tries to process the input key as a list of keys when it is not found in the index (column names). This functionality results in problematic handling of string keys as lists of keys, causing the function to raise a `KeyError`. This bug affects cases where the `key` should be treated as a single key but is mistakenly interpreted as multiple keys due to the missing handling of string keys as lists.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `_get_grouper` function to correctly handle the case when the input key is a single string key instead of a list of keys. We need to ensure that the function interprets a string key correctly as a single key rather than treating it as a list of keys.

## Bug-fixed Function
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function that resolves the issue and should pass the failing test cases:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Other parts of the function remain the same as provided

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]  # Ensure key is treated as a list
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # Other parts of the function remain the same as provided
```

By modifying the handling of the `key` input parameter, ensuring it is treated as a list only if it is not already a list, the corrected function should address the bug and pass the failing test cases.
