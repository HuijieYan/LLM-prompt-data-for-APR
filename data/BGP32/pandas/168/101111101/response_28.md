## Bug Analysis
- The bug occurs when using a single string as the `key` parameter in the `df.groupby(group_name, axis=1).sum()` function call.
- The bug is caused by `key` being expected to be a list of keys due to future updates planned by the pandas library.
- The code checks for a tuple and converts it to a list but does not handle the case where a single string is passed directly as `key`.
- This results in the function not correctly identifying the key to group by.

## Bug Fix Strategy
- We need to handle the case where a single string is passed as `key` and convert it to a list of keys to align with the intended future behavior of pandas.
- Additionally, we should check if `key` is not already a list and directly convert it to a list to ensure consistency.

## Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the buggy `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # code

    # Convert key to a list if it's a single string
    if isinstance(key, str):
        key = [key]

    # If not already a list, convert key to a list
    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # Rest of the code remains the same

    # return statement
```

With this fix, the function will correctly handle cases where a single string is passed as `key` and ensure that `key` is converted to a list before further processing.
