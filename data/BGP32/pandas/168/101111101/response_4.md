## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `key` parameter is expected to be a single value, not a list. When it is passed as a list, the function fails to handle it correctly, resulting in a KeyError because it tries to process the list as if it were a single key.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic to handle the `key` parameter correctly when it is provided as a list. We should update the function to handle both single values and lists as keys to ensure it works correctly in all scenarios.

## Bug-fixed Function
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # Handle list of keys
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)
    else:
        keys = [key]  # Handle single key
        match_axis_length = False

    any_callable = any(callable(g) or isinstance(g, dict) for g in keys)
    any_groupers = any(isinstance(g, Grouper) for g in keys)
    any_arraylike = any(
        isinstance(g, (list, tuple, Series, Index, np.ndarray)) for g in keys
    )

    if (
        not any_callable
        and not any_arraylike
        and not any_groupers
        and match_axis_length
        and level is None
    ):
        if isinstance(obj, DataFrame):
            all_in_columns_index = all(
                g in obj.columns or g in obj.index.names for g in keys
            )
        elif isinstance(obj, Series):
            all_in_columns_index = all(g in obj.index.names for g in keys)

        if not all_in_columns_index:
            keys = [com.asarray_tuplesafe(keys)]

    if isinstance(level, (tuple, list)):
        if key is None:
            keys = [None] * len(level)
        levels = level
    else:
        levels = [level] * len(keys)

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    # Remaining code stays the same
    ...
```

By updating the handling of the `key` parameter to accommodate both single values and lists, the function should now be able to process the input correctly and avoid the KeyError issue.
