## Bug Explanation
The bug seems to be occurring due to the comparison of the `key` variable inside the `_get_grouper` function. When `key` is provided as a list, the comparison on line 1252 `key not in obj and set(key).issubset(obj)` doesn't work correctly due to the list comparison. This causes the program to raise a `KeyError` when `_is_label_like(key)` returns `False`.

## Bug Fix
To fix this issue, we need to change the comparison logic for `key` when it's a list. We should consider all elements of the list for the comparison rather than just a single element. Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper()` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... existing implementation

    if is_list_like(key):
        keys = key
        all_hashable = all(is_hashable(k) for k in keys)
        if all_hashable and not any(k in obj for k in keys):
            # Change the list comparison to consider all elements
            if not set(keys).issubset(obj):
                msg = (
                    "Interpreting list 'by' as a list of keys. "
                    "Use 'by=[...]' instead. "
                )
                warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
        key = keys

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # ... remaining implementation
```

By making this change, the function should now be able to correctly handle `key` when it's provided as a list, and the comparison logic should work as intended.

Now, you can test the fixed function with the failing test cases to confirm that the bug has been resolved.
