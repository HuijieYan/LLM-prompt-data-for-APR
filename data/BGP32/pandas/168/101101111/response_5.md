Based on the analyses provided, the issue seems to stem from the `_get_grouper` function in the `pandas.core.groupby.grouper.py` file. The function fails to correctly handle the grouping by columns when `axis=1`, resulting in a KeyError when trying to group by column names.

To fix this issue, we need to update the `_get_grouper` function to properly handle the case when grouping by columns. The adjustments will involve ensuring that the function correctly identifies the column names when `axis=1` and uses them for grouping.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps

    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(group_axis, Index):
        if key in group_axis:
            key = group_axis.get_loc(key)

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    if isinstance(key, str) or (is_list_like(key) and len(key) == 1):
        key = [key]

    for i, gpr in enumerate(key):
        if gpr in group_axis:
            ping = Grouping(group_axis, gpr, obj=obj, name=gpr, level=level)
            groupings.append(ping)
        else:
            raise KeyError(gpr)

    if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

By making the above changes to handle column grouping correctly, the `_get_grouper` function should now correctly group by column names when `axis=1`, resolving the KeyError issue outlined in the GitHub problem description. This fix should allow the failing test case to pass successfully.
