Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test cases, the issue arises from how the function handles grouping by columns when using the `groupby()` function along with the `axis=1` parameter. The function fails to correctly identify column names and raise a KeyError when attempting to group by columns.

To fix this issue, the correction involves updating the logic in the `_get_grouper()` function to properly handle grouping by columns. Specifically, the code needs to ensure that column names are correctly identified and used for grouping operations.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper()` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # handle grouping by columns
    if obj.columns.name == key and axis == 1:
        key = list(obj.columns)

    # the rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

By explicitly checking if the input key matches the column names when grouping along axis=1, we can resolve the issue of KeyError during the grouping operation.

Ensure to include this corrected version in the appropriate file (`pandas/core/groupby/grouper.py`) for it to take effect. Once applied, rerun the failing test cases, and they should pass successfully.
