## Issue Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_grouper` is not correctly handling the case when using `groupby` with `axis=1` to group by columns.
- The function is not identifying the columns correctly to perform the grouping operation as expected.
- The issue reported on GitHub highlights the incorrect behavior when using `groupby(by="x", axis=1).sum()`.
- The function should properly handle grouping by columns names when axis is set to 1.

## Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in the `_get_grouper` function that fails to recognize column names when grouping along columns.
- The function should identify the columns to create appropriate groupings based on the specified column names.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_get_grouper` function, the following approach can be taken:
- Modify the logic related to identifying columns and creating the appropriate groupings when `axis=1`.
- Ensure that the function can correctly handle grouping by column names.
- Refactor the code to improve the logic related to identifying and grouping along columns.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    if axis == 1 and key is not None:
        if isinstance(key, str):
            if key in obj.columns:
                key = obj[key]
            else:
                raise KeyError(f"Column name '{key}' not found.")

    # Rest of the original _get_grouper function code...
```

By adding the above code snippet to handle grouping by columns when `axis=1`, the corrected function can properly create the required groupings based on the specified column names.

This correction should enable the function to pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to incorrect grouping behavior when using `groupby(by="x", axis=1)`.
