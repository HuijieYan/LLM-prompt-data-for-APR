Based on the analysis of the provided buggy function, its relationships with related functions, and the failing tests, the root cause of the bug is that the logic for handling the grouping by columns is not correctly identifying the columns when using a single column name as input.

To fix the bug, we need to modify how the function processes the key when it represents a column name for grouping. We should ensure that single column names are correctly identified and used for grouping along the columns axis.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Handling grouping by columns when key is a single column name
    if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
        if is_list_like(key) and len(key) == 1:
            key = key[0]

        if key is None and is_scalar(level):
            key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
            level = None
    else:
        if is_list_like(level):
            nlevels = len(level)
            if nlevels == 1:
                level = level[0]
            elif nlevels == 0:
                raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
            else:
                raise ValueError("Multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

        if isinstance(level, list) or isinstance(level, tuple):
            raise ValueError("Level must be a single level for non-MultiIndex data.")

        if level:
            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.columns.name != level:
                    raise ValueError("Level name {} is not the name of the columns".format(level))
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    # remaining function implementation unchanged from here
    
```

By making these adjustments to the function, it should correctly handle grouping by columns when a single column name is provided as the key. This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug related to the incorrect handling of grouping along columns.
