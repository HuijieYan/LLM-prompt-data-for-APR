## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs due to an error in handling the `is_tuple` condition in the `_get_grouper` function. When `is_tuple` is true and there are some unhashable elements in the `key`, it incorrectly converts the `key` list into a tuple, leading to unexpected behavior and the KeyError in the failing test cases.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the logic around the handling of tuples in the `key` variable needs to be corrected. Specifically, the code should not convert the `key` list into a tuple if there are unhashable elements. Instead, it should treat the `key` list as a list of keys.

## The Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Existing code before the bug location

    if is_tuple:
        if key not in obj and set(key).issubset(obj) or not all_hashable:
            msg = (
                "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than "
                "a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In "
                "the future, a tuple will always mean a single key."
            )
            warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
            key = list(key)

        if not isinstance(key, list):
            keys = [key]
            match_axis_length = False
        else:
            keys = key
            match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

        # Existing code after the bug location
```

By correcting the logic related to the handling of tuples in the `key` variable, the function should now properly handle the list of keys without converting it into a tuple unexpectedly. This modification should resolve the issue and make the function behave as expected in the failing test cases.
