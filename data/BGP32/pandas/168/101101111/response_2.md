Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test cases provided, along with the expected input/output values and the GitHub issue, it seems that the bug occurs due to incorrect handling of grouping along columns when passing column name(s) as the key in the `groupby` function with `axis=1`.

To resolve this issue, we need to update the `_get_grouper` function to correctly handle the case where the key is a column name when grouping along columns. The bug arises from the way keys are processed and checked, leading to incorrect behavior during column grouping.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
        if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
            level = level[0]

        if key is None and is_scalar(level):
            key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
            level = None
    else:
        if is_list_like(level):
            nlevels = len(level)
            if nlevels == 1:
                level = level[0]
            elif nlevels == 0:
                raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
            else:
                raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

        if isinstance(level, str):
            if obj.columns.name != level:
                raise ValueError(
                    "level name {} is not the name of the columns".format(level)
                )
        elif level > 0 or level < -1:
            raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

        level = None
        key = group_axis

    ...  # The rest of the function remains the same as the original

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

With this correction, the function should now handle grouping along columns properly when passing column name(s) as the key, resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.

Please test this corrected version with the failing test cases to ensure that it now passes and behaves as expected.
