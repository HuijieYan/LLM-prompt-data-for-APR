After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test cases, it appears that the issue arises from how the keys are processed when grouping along axis 1 (columns) in the `_get_grouper` function. The function fails to correctly handle the keys when they are specified as a list containing column names. To resolve this issue, we need to ensure that the keys are appropriately processed and the grouping operation is performed correctly along the columns as intended.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Process the case when key is a list of column names
    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == group_axis.nlevels

        any_callable = any(callable(g) or isinstance(g, dict) for g in keys)
        any_groupers = any(isinstance(g, Grouper) for g in keys)
        any_arraylike = any(
            isinstance(g, (list, tuple, Series, Index, np.ndarray)) for g in keys
        )

        if not any_callable and not any_arraylike and not any_groupers and match_axis_length and level is None:
            groupings = []
            exclusions = []

            for i, col_name in enumerate(keys):
                if col_name in obj.columns:
                    ping = Grouping(
                        group_axis,
                        obj[col_name],
                        obj=obj,
                        name=col_name,
                        level=level,
                        sort=sort,
                        observed=observed,
                        in_axis=True,
                    )
                    groupings.append(ping)
                    exclusions.append(col_name)
                else:
                    raise KeyError(col_name)

            if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj.columns):
                raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
            elif len(groupings) == 0:
                groupings.append(Grouping(Index([], dtype="int"), np.array([], dtype=np.intp)))

            grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
            return grouper, exclusions, obj

    # Process other cases when key is not a list of column names
    # (...remaining code remains the same as the original function...)
```

This correction includes a specific handling branch for the case when the key is a list containing column names. It creates Grouping objects for each column specified in the keys list and correctly performs the grouping operation along the specified columns.

This corrected function should now handle the grouping operation along columns correctly when key is provided as a list of column names as in the failing test cases.

By applying this fix, the function should pass the failing tests and properly group along the columns as intended by the user.
