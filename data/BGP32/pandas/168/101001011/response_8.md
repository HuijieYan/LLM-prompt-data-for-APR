### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_get_grouper` function due to a misunderstanding of the keys passed as input when grouping along columns. The function wrongly interprets the column names as a tuple of keys instead of a list of keys when grouping along columns, leading to a KeyError. This behavior is inconsistent with the expected functionality based on the GitHub issue description.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the handling of the keys when grouping along columns. Specifically, we should ensure that the keys passed as column names are treated as a list of keys rather than a tuple. This adjustment will align the function's behavior with the expected grouping along columns for DataFrame objects.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_grouper` Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
    
    # Correcting the interpretation of keys when grouping along columns
    if axis == 1 and key is not None:
        key = [key] if not isinstance(key, list) else key

    # Validate that the passed single level is compatible with the object's axis
    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("Multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "Level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("Level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    # Rest of the function remains as is, ensuring correct processing of groupers
    
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

By including the correction for interpreting keys in the `_get_grouper` function, we resolve the bug related to grouping along columns based on the column names provided as keys. This correction aligns the function's behavior with the expected outcome when grouping DataFrame objects.
