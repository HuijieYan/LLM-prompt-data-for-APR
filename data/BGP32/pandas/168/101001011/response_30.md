The issue described on GitHub indicates that there is a problem with grouping along columns when using the `groupby` method with `axis=1` and passing column names as the grouping criteria. The KeyError is raised even though the column name exists in the DataFrame.

After analyzing the provided buggy function `_get_grouper`, the bug seems to be related to the handling of column names when grouping along columns. The function does not properly handle the case when column names are used as keys for grouping along axis=1.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `_get_grouper` function to correctly recognize and handle column names when grouping along columns.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function that addresses the issue:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is None and isinstance(key, str) and key in obj.columns:
        key = key  # Key is a valid column name
    elif level is None and isinstance(key, list) and all(col in obj.columns for col in key):
        key = key  # Key is a valid list of column names
    else:
        raise KeyError(key)  # Raise KeyError if key is not a valid column name or list of column names

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, Grouping(group_axis, key, obj=obj))
    return grouper, [], obj
```

In this corrected version:
1. We check if `key` is a valid column name or a list of valid column names in the DataFrame.
2. If `key` is a string that exists in the columns or a list of strings that all exist in the columns, we proceed with creating the grouper.
3. If `key` is not a valid column name or list of column names, a KeyError is raised to indicate that the provided key(s) are not valid.

This change should address the issue described in the GitHub problem and allow for proper grouping along columns using column names as keys. Make sure to integrate this corrected `_get_grouper` function into the appropriate location in the `grouper.py` file within the pandas library.
