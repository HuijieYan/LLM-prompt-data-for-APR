The bug in the `_get_grouper` function stems from incorrect handling of the `key` parameter when it is a single string representing a column name. This issue causes a KeyError to be raised even when the column name is valid. The key component is not correctly identified and processed as a valid column label during the grouping operation which leads to the problem outlined in the GitHub issue.

To fix this bug, we should ensure that the `key` parameter is correctly processed when it represents a column name. We can modify the code to correctly identify the column name and use it in the grouping operation.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Handle grouping by column name
    if key is not None and isinstance(key, str) and key in obj.columns:
        key = obj[key]

    # Other parts of the function remain unchanged

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This correction involves checking if the `key` parameter is a string and if it exists in the dataframe's columns. If both conditions are met, we replace the key with the actual column data before proceeding with the grouping operation.

By making this adjustment, the function should now correctly handle grouping by column names, thereby addressing the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
