### Bug Explanation

The bug in the `_get_grouper` function arises due to the incorrect processing of the input key when grouping along columns. The function fails to recognize column names as valid keys when grouping along the column axis (axis=1). This behavior contradicts the expected functionality described in the GitHub issue, where grouping by columns is intended to be performed based on column names.

The bug can be attributed to the inconsistent handling of keys and the failure to properly identify column names as valid grouping keys. This inconsistency leads to a KeyError when attempting to group along columns by column names.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug and align the grouping functionality with the desired behavior described in the GitHub issue, we need to ensure that column names are correctly recognized as valid grouping keys when grouping along the column axis. Additionally, any discrepancies in key processing should be addressed to provide consistent and expected behavior. 

### Corrected Function

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if axis == 1 and key is not None and not isinstance(key, list):
        key = [key]

    if key is None:
        key = group_axis

    if isinstance(key, list) and len(key) == 1:
        key = key[0]

    if isinstance(key, str) and key not in obj.columns:
        raise KeyError(key)

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, [Grouping(group_axis, key, obj=obj, in_axis=True)], sort=sort, mutated=mutated)

    return grouper, [], obj
```

### Proposed Changes
1. Check if the axis is 1 and the key is not a list, convert it to a list for consistency.
2. If key is None, set it to the column index.
3. If key is a single string, validate that it exists in the columns, raising a KeyError if it doesn't.
4. Create the BaseGrouper with a single Grouping object based on the specified key, treating it as a column name for grouping along columns.

By making these changes, the corrected function will correctly handle column names as keys when performing grouping along the column axis, addressing the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
