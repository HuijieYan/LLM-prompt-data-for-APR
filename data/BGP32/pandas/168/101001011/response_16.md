## Bug Explanation

The bug is occurring because in the buggy `_get_grouper` function, the `is_tuple` condition is incorrectly set to check if `key` is a tuple, but it should check if `keys` is a tuple. This incorrect condition leads to wrong behavior when handling the input key parameter, especially when it is a single key passed as a string. Due to this issue, the `FutureWarning` is raised, and the key is converted to a list, but this conversion is not applied correctly because of the mistake in the condition.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the condition correctly to check if `keys` is a tuple instead of `key`. This change will ensure the correct handling of the input key parameter and prevent unnecessary conversion to a list. By correcting this check, the warning message will be triggered only when a tuple key is provided, and any issues associated with the key conversion will be resolved.

## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Existing code...

    is_tuple = isinstance(keys, tuple)  # Corrected check

    if is_tuple:
        all_hashable = all(is_hashable(k) for k in keys)

        if all_hashable and keys not in obj and set(keys).issubset(obj):
            msg = (
                "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than "
                "a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In "
                "the future, a tuple will always mean a single key."
            )
            warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
            keys = list(keys)

    # Existing code handling key parameter...

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
``` 

This corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function adjusts the condition for `is_tuple` to correctly identify if `keys` is a tuple. This fix ensures that the warning and key conversion are only triggered when a tuple key is provided. This adjustment addresses the bug and resolves the issue reported on GitHub related to incorrect grouping along columns by name.
