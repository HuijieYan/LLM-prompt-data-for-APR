## Correction

Based on the provided information, the bug seems to stem from how the grouping is handled when `groupby` is called with `axis=1`. The issue arises when trying to group by column names, which leads to a KeyError.

To address this bug, we need to modify the `_get_grouper` function to correctly handle the grouping by column names when `axis=1`. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Ensure axis is set correctly for column grouping
    if axis == 1:
        obj = obj.T  # Transpose the DataFrame for column grouping
        group_axis = obj._get_axis(1)
    else:
        group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Rest of the function remains the same as in the original function
    ...
```

With this modification, the function will correctly handle column grouping by transposing the DataFrame when `axis=1`, ensuring that the groupby operation on column names works as expected.

This correction should resolve the KeyError issue when grouping by column names. Please test the corrected function with the failing test cases to verify the fix.
