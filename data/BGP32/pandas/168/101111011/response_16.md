The bug in the `_get_grouper` function lies in the handling of `key` when it is a list of keys. The code assumes that when `key` is a list, it should be split into individual keys and processed separately. However, in the case when `key` is passed as a list, it should be treated as a single key representing multiple columns to group by. 

To fix this issue, we need to modify the logic for handling `key` when it is a list. Instead of separating it into individual keys, we should keep it as a single key representing multiple columns.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function to address this bug:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if key is None and is_scalar(level):
            key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
            level = None

    is_tuple = isinstance(key, tuple)
    all_hashable = is_tuple and is_hashable(key)

    if is_tuple:
        if (
            all_hashable and key not in obj and set(key).issubset(obj)
        ) or not all_hashable:
            warnings.warn(
                "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In the future, a tuple will always mean a single key.",
                FutureWarning,
                stacklevel=5
            )
            key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = [key]  # Treat key as a single key when it is a list

    match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    any_callable = any(callable(g) or isinstance(g, dict) for g in keys)
    any_groupers = any(isinstance(g, Grouper) for g in keys)
    any_arraylike = any(
        isinstance(g, (list, tuple, Series, Index, np.ndarray)) for g in keys
    )

    if (
        not any_callable
        and not any_arraylike
        and not any_groupers
        and match_axis_length
        and level is None
    ):
        if isinstance(obj, DataFrame):
            all_in_columns_index = all(
                g in obj.columns or g in obj.index.names for g in keys
            )
        elif isinstance(obj, Series):
            all_in_columns_index = all(g in obj.index.names for g in keys)

        if not all_in_columns_index:
            keys = [com.asarray_tuplesafe(keys)]

    if isinstance(level, (tuple, list)):
        if key is None:
            keys = [None] * len(level)
        levels = level
    else:
        levels = [level] * len(keys)

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for i, (gpr, level) in enumerate(zip(keys, levels)):
        # Remaining code unchanged
```

By treating `key` as a single key when it is a list, we avoid the incorrect splitting of keys and ensure that the function groups by the columns specified in the list.

This correction should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the `_get_grouper` function work correctly for grouping by columns when passing a list of keys.
