## Bug Explanation

The issue arises from the `_get_grouper` function not handling the given key properly when it is a list of keys on the axis parameter. The function assumes a single key and fails to process the list of keys correctly. This results in raising a `KeyError` when trying to group by multiple keys on the `axis=1`.

## Bug Fix

To correct this bug, the function needs to distinguish between a single key and a list of keys properly. We need to adjust the logic to handle the case where multiple keys are provided on the axis parameter. By iterating over each key in the list and processing them individually, we can create the required Grouping objects for each key. Additionally, the function should return the aggregated results when grouping by multiple keys on the specified axis.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        raise ValueError("level should be None when grouping by multiple keys")

    if isinstance(key, list):
        groupings = []
        exclusions = []

        for k in key:
            groupers, excl, _ = _get_grouper(obj, key=k, axis=axis, level=None, sort=sort, observed=observed, mutated=mutated, validate=False)
            groupings.extend(groupers)
            exclusions.extend(excl)

        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)

        return grouper, exclusions, obj

    elif isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj

    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj

    # Other key handling logic...

```

## After applying this corrected version, the function should be able to correctly group by both single keys and multiple keys on the specified axis parameter. This fix addresses the KeyError issue when grouping by multiple keys on axis=1.
