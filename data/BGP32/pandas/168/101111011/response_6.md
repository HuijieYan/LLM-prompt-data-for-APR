Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug is related to the way the function processes the `key` parameter when it is passed as a single string or as a list containing a single string. The bug leads to a KeyError because it doesn't handle this scenario correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic that processes the `key` parameter when it is a string or a list with a single string. Specifically, we should ensure that the handling of single string values is consistent with the handling of lists with a single string to prevent the KeyError.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Function body remains the same as provided, with bug fixed handling of key parameter

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # validate that the passed single level is compatible with the passed
    # axis of the object
    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                # Get the level values from group_axis
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError("level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level))
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None

            if isinstance(key, str):  # Handle single string key
                if obj.columns.name != key:
                    raise ValueError("key {} is not the name of the columns".format(key))
            elif is_list_like(key) and len(key) == 1 and isinstance(key[0], str):  # Handle list with single string key
                if obj.columns.name != key[0]:
                    raise ValueError("key {} is not the name of the columns".format(key[0]))
                key = key[0]

    # Remaining function body stays the same...

```

With this correction, the function now correctly handles the case when `key` is a single string or a list with a single string, ensuring that the columns are correctly grouped when using the column name as the key. This should resolve the KeyError issue reported in the GitHub bug.

After applying this fix, you can rerun the failing test cases to confirm that the bug has been successfully addressed.
