Based on the provided information, it seems that the issue lies in how the `key` is handled in the `_get_grouper` function when `axis=1`. The `key` should be the column name(s) when grouping along columns, but it is not being processed correctly resulting in a `KeyError`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `axis=1` and grouping along columns, the `key` parameter correctly represents the column name(s). Updating the logic to handle column names in the `key` parameter will resolve the issue.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if axis == 1:
        if isinstance(key, str):
            key = [key]
        if isinstance(key, list):
            keys = key
            match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

            any_callable = any(callable(g) or isinstance(g, dict) for g in keys)
            any_arraylike = any(
                isinstance(g, (list, tuple, Series, Index, np.ndarray)) for g in keys
            )

            if not any_callable and not any_arraylike and match_axis_length and level is None:
                if not all(g in obj.columns for g in keys):
                    keys = [com.asarray_tuplesafe(keys)]

            # Create groupings for each column
            groupings = []
            for col in keys:
                ping = Grouping(
                    group_axis,
                    obj[col],
                    obj=obj,
                    name=col,
                    level=None,
                    sort=sort,
                    observed=observed,
                    in_axis=True,
                )
                groupings.append(ping)

            if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
                raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")

            # Create the BaseGrouper
            grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)

            return grouper, keys, obj

    # For other cases, handle as before
    ...
```

This corrected version ensures that when `axis=1`, the `key` parameter is correctly processed as column name(s) for grouping along columns.

Once you replace the buggy `_get_grouper` function with this corrected version, the failing test cases should pass, and the issue described on GitHub should be resolved.
