## Bug Explanation

The bug occurs in the `_get_grouper` function when the `key` parameter is passed as a list, which is intended to group by columns. The function fails to handle this correctly and raises a `KeyError`.

The function tries to interpret the passed `key` as a list of keys when it is not found in the index. However, due to an issue in the code, it does not handle the case properly, resulting in the `KeyError` being raised.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the case when `key` is passed as a list, indicating grouping by columns. We should modify the code to properly interpret a list of keys for grouping by columns.

## Bug Fix

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        # Handling MultiIndex cases
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError("level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level))
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    # Check if key is a list, indicating grouping by columns
    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

        if match_axis_length and not any(callable(g) for g in keys):
            if isinstance(obj, DataFrame):
                all_in_columns_index = all(g in obj.columns for g in keys)
            else:
                all_in_columns_index = all(g in obj.index.names for g in keys)

            if all_in_columns_index:
                key = keys

    # Continue with the rest of the function as before

```

This corrected version of the function includes the necessary modifications to handle grouping by columns when `key` is passed as a list. It checks if all the keys in the list are valid columns and then proceeds with the grouping process accordingly.
