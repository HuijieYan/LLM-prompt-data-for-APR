Based on the analysis of the failing test and the provided buggy function, the bug seems to be related to handling column names during grouping when using `groupby` along the columns axis (`axis=1`). The bug occurs because the code does not handle column names correctly, resulting in a `KeyError`. 

The main issue in the buggy code lies in the handling of the `key` parameter, specifically when `axis=1` and the `key` is a column name. The implementation logic is primarily focused on treating the `key` differently based on its type, but it fails to accurately identify the column names when grouping along the columns axis.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic in the `_get_grouper` function to correctly identify column names and create groupings based on them when `axis=1`. Additionally, we need to ensure that the `key` parameter is processed correctly for column names.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if key is None and isinstance(level, str) and level in obj.columns:
            key = level
            level = None

    if key in obj.columns:
        key = obj[key]

    groupings = [Grouping(group_axis, key, obj=obj, name=key.name, sort=sort, in_axis=True)]

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, [], obj
```

In this corrected version, we ensure that the `key` parameter represents a column name correctly and create groupings based on the column names when grouping along the columns axis (`axis=1`).

This correction should resolve the KeyError issue raised in the failing test and align with the expected behavior of grouping by column names.
