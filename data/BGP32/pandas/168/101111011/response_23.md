Based on the analysis and the failing test provided, the bug in the `_get_grouper` function lies in the handling of column names during the grouping operation. The function fails to correctly interpret the column name passed as the key for grouping along axis 1.

The issue arises due to the discrepancy in handling the column name 'x' for grouping, where it incorrectly results in a `KeyError` exception. To fix this bug, the function needs to correctly identify and process the column names for grouping operations along axis 1.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
    
    if key is None:
        key = []
    elif not isinstance(key, list):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key[0], str):
        key = [key[0]]

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for k in key:
        ping = Grouping(group_axis, k, obj=obj, name=k, level=None, sort=sort, observed=observed, in_axis=True)
        groupings.append(ping)

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This corrected version simplifies the handling of the key parameter for column names by ensuring it is correctly converted to a list and processed as a single element before creating the groupings. This change should resolve the KeyError issue encountered during column grouping operations along axis 1.

By implementing this correction, the `_get_grouper` function should now behave as expected and pass the failing test case, resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report.
