### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_grouper` function arises from how the `key` variable is handled when it is a list containing a single item. In the case when `level` is not `None` and `group_axis` is not a `MultiIndex`, the code is supposed to handle a list-like `level` object, but there are issues in the implementation. The conditions for checking lengths and conversions are causing incorrect handling of the `key` variable when it is a list.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the handling of the `key` variable when it is a list containing a single item. We should ensure that the code correctly processes the `level` and `key` variables based on the conditions provided in the function.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
            level = level[0]

        if key is None and is_scalar(level):
            key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
            level = None

    if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
        if is_list_like(level):
            nlevels = len(level)
            if nlevels == 1:
                level = level[0]
            elif nlevels == 0:
                raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
            else:
                raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

    # Remaining code unchanged
    ...
```

By correcting the handling of the `key` variable when it is a list containing a single item, the function should now correctly process the inputs and behave as expected, passing the failing test cases.
