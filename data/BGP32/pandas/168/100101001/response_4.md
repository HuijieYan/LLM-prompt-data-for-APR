The bug in the `_get_grouper` function lies in the handling of the `key` parameter when it is a tuple. The function incorrectly interprets the tuple `key` as a single key instead of a list of keys. This causes issues with further processing, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we need to properly handle the case when `key` is a tuple and ensure that it is treated as a list of keys. We should modify the code to correctly interpret tuples as lists of keys.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Existing code up to the beginning of tuple processing
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        if (
            all(is_hashable(k) for k in key) and any(k not in obj for k in key)
        ) or not all(is_hashable(k) for k in key):
            msg = (
                "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than "
                "a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In "
                "the future, a tuple will always mean a single key."
            )
            warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
            key = list(key)

    # Rest of the existing code remains unchanged

    # The rest of the function remains the same
```

By updating the code to handle tuple keys correctly, the function should now process the input parameters as expected and pass the failing test cases.
