The bug in the `_get_grouper` function seems to be related to the processing of input parameters 'key' and 'level' when the 'axis' is 0. In the failing test cases, the function doesn't handle grouping by columns correctly when 'axis' is 1.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the case where 'key' is a list of columns to group by when 'axis' is 1. The code path for column grouping is not properly implemented, causing a KeyError when trying to group by column names.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the case when 'axis' is 1 and 'key' is a list of column names. We need to modify the logic to properly group by columns in this scenario.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if key is not None and axis == 1 and isinstance(key, (str, list)):
        if isinstance(key, str):
            key = [key]
        keys = key

        groupings = []
        exclusions = []

        for gpr in keys:
            if gpr not in obj:
                raise KeyError(gpr)

            gpr_data = obj[gpr]
            if is_categorical_dtype(gpr_data) and len(gpr_data) != obj.shape[0]:
                raise ValueError("Length of grouper and axis must be the same length")

            ping = Grouping(
                group_axis,
                gpr_data,
                obj=obj,
                name=gpr,
                level=None,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                in_axis=True,
            )
            groupings.append(ping)

        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, exclusions, obj
    
    # Handle other cases as before
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

This corrected version of the function should now correctly handle grouping by column names (or a list of column names) when 'axis' is 1. It addresses the issue described in the failing test cases and the GitHub issue.

After applying this fix, the `_get_grouper` function should pass all the failing test cases provided.
