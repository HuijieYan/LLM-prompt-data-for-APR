Based on the provided information, the bug in the `_get_grouper` function can be identified as the handling of the `key` parameter when it is a list. The function is not correctly processing the list of keys passed for grouping along columns.

The `key` parameter should be treated as a list of column name(s) to group by when `axis=1`. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly processes the list of keys provided for grouping along columns.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of the `key` parameter when it is a list in the `_get_grouper` function. The function should be able to handle a list of column name(s) when grouping data along columns. Currently, the function fails to process this scenario, leading to a `KeyError` when trying to group by column names.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug in the `_get_grouper` function, we need to modify the code to correctly handle a list of keys for grouping along columns. This involves iterating over each key in the list and creating individual groupings for each key. The resulting groupings should then be combined into a `BaseGrouper`.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_grouper` Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Process list of keys when grouping along columns
    if isinstance(key, list):
        groupings = []
        exclusions = []

        for k in key:
            gpr = k

            # Create the Grouping for each key
            ping = Grouping(
                group_axis,
                gpr,
                obj=obj,
                name=None,
                level=level,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                in_axis=True,
            )

            groupings.append(ping)

        # Create the internal grouper with all groupings
        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, exclusions, obj

    # Other existing logic for non-list keys
    # ...

```

This corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function should now correctly handle a list of keys when grouping data along columns, resolving the bug identified in the GitHub issue.
