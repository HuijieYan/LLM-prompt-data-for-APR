Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test cases, the cause of the bug is identified as follows:

1. In the `_get_grouper` function, the handling of the `key` parameter for grouping along columns is not properly implemented. This leads to incorrect processing of the column names when grouping by columns.
2. The bug is triggered when trying to group along columns using the `key` parameter with column names, resulting in a KeyError due to the improper handling of the column selection process.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in `_get_grouper` related to grouping along columns. Specifically, we need to ensure that the `key` parameter is correctly interpreted as columns to group by, allowing proper grouping operations along columns.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # logic to handle grouping along columns
    if axis == 1 and key is not None and isinstance(key, str):
        # convert column name to actual column label
        if key in obj.columns:
            key = obj[key]

    # rest of the function remains unchanged

    ...
```

By updating the `_get_grouper` function with the provided logic to correctly interpret columns when grouping along axis 1, the bug related to the incorrect handling of column names for grouping purposes should be resolved. This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub thread and allow the function to pass the failing test cases.
