### Step 3: Explain the cause of the bug

The bug in the `_get_grouper` function is occurring due to the way it handles the grouping by columns when `key` is provided as a string. The function is designed to create groupings based on the provided `key`, which can be a list of columns to group by. However, when a single column name is provided as a string, the function fails to handle this scenario correctly, leading to a KeyError.

In the failing test case, the function `test_groupby_axis_1` is attempting to group a DataFrame `df` by a single column name `'x'` along `axis=1`. The expected behavior is to group by the column labeled `'x'`, but the function fails to handle this and raises a KeyError.

The issue reported on GitHub also highlights this problem, where the user expects to group by the column name "x" along `axis=1` but encounters an error.

### Step 4: Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, the `_get_grouper` function needs to properly handle the case when a single column name is provided as a string for grouping. The function should recognize that this string represents a column label and create the groupings accordingly.

One approach to fix this issue is to check if the `key` provided is a string representing a column name. If it is, the function should create the necessary groupings based on that column. Additionally, the logic for handling column groupings should be updated to ensure that the function can group by column names correctly.

### Step 5: Corrected version of the buggy function

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        # Simplified handling of level for a single column label
        if not isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex) and is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
            level = level[0]

        if key is None and is_scalar(level):
            key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
            level = None

    # Check if key is a string representing a column name
    if isinstance(key, str) and key in obj:
        key = obj[key]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged...
}
```

By updating the function to handle the case of a single column name provided as a string, the corrected version should be able to group by columns correctly when `key` is a string. This fix addresses the KeyError issue encountered when grouping by a single column label.
