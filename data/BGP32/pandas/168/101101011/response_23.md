### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_get_grouper` function arises due to the handling of the `key` parameter, specifically when the `is_tuple` condition is triggered. The logic for converting a tuple `key` to a list is incorrect, leading to unexpected behavior when grouping.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the logic for converting a tuple `key` to a list should be revised, ensuring that it correctly handles cases where the `key` is a tuple and needs to be converted to a list for further processing.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_grouper` Function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Existing code...

    # Fix the logic for converting a tuple key to a list
    is_tuple = isinstance(key, tuple)
    all_hashable = is_tuple and all(is_hashable(k) for k in key)

    if is_tuple:
        if (all_hashable and key not in obj and set(key).issubset(obj)) or not all_hashable:
            # Convert tuple 'key' to a list of keys
            msg = (
                "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than "
                "a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In "
                "the future, a tuple will always mean a single key."
            )
            warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
            key = list(key)

    # Existing code...

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

By revising the logic for handling a tuple `key`, the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function should now correctly process the input parameters and avoid the KeyError issue reported in the GitHub bug.
