Based on the buggy function and the failing test provided, the issue arises from the incorrect handling of grouping along columns when using `groupby(by="x", axis=1)`. The bug occurs in the `_get_grouper` function at the section where it checks the compatibility of the level with the axis.

The bug is caused by the function incorrectly handling the grouping keys when dealing with column-based grouping. The function fails to properly recognize and handle column names when performing the grouping operation along the columns axis.

To fix the issue, the `_get_grouper` function should be modified to handle column-based grouping correctly by ensuring that the provided key for grouping along columns is interpreted correctly as column names. This can be achieved by adjusting the logic to correctly identify and extract the column names as keys for the grouping operation.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        # Simplified handling for MultiIndex
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex) and is_list_like(level):
            level = level[0]

        # Ensure key is None if it's a scalar level
        if key is None and is_scalar(level):
            key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
            level = None

    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj

    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        if key not in obj.columns and set(key).issubset(obj.columns):
            key = list(key)
            warnings.warn(
                "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In the future, a tuple will always mean a single key.",
                FutureWarning,
                stacklevel=2,
            )

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = key

    # Handle column-based grouping by ensuring correct identification of column names
    if all(not is_list_like(k) and is_hashable(k) for k in keys):
        keys = [k for k in keys if k in obj and not is_list_like(obj[k])]
    else:
        keys = [k for k in keys if k in obj]

    groupings = []

    for k in keys:
        ping = Grouping(
            group_axis,
            k,
            obj=obj,
            name=k if isinstance(k, str) else None,
            level=None,
            sort=sort,
            observed=observed,
            in_axis=True,
        )
        groupings.append(ping)

    if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
    elif len(groupings) == 0:
        groupings.append(Grouping(Index([], dtype="int"), np.array([], dtype=np.intp)))

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, [], obj
```

By correcting the logic in the `_get_grouper` function, the issue related to grouping along columns using `groupby(by="x", axis=1)` should be resolved. The corrected version handles column names correctly and should now pass the failing test and address the GitHub issue regarding implicit selection by column name in groupby operations.
