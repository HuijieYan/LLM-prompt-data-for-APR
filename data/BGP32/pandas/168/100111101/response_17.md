### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_get_grouper` function lies in the handling of the `key` input parameter. When the value of `key` is provided as a single string, the function processes it correctly. However, when `key` is passed as a list containing a single string, the function incorrectly converts the list into a tuple before handling the processing for single string keys. This results in an inconsistency in the processing logic and leads to a `KeyError` being raised for the key in the list.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function treats both single string keys and keys in a list consistently. We can modify the logic to handle both cases in a uniform manner. Specifically, we should preprocess the `key` input parameter to ensure that it is always a list internally.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    ...

    # Ensure key is always a list internally
    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = key

    # Rest of the function remains the same

    ...

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

By ensuring that `key` is always treated as a list internally, we maintain consistent processing and avoid the KeyError issue that occurs with single string keys in a list.
