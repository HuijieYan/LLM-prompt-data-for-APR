Based on the analysis of the provided buggy function and the failing test cases, we can see that the bug stems from incorrectly handling the `key` input parameter that is expected to be a single key but is being received as a list of keys in the failing test cases. 

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where a list of keys is provided in a way that it correctly processes the individual keys. This can be achieved by iterating over the keys when `key` is a list and creating the necessary groupings for each key.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        groupings = []
        exclusions = []
        
        for k in key:
            ping = Grouping(
                group_axis,
                k,
                obj=obj,
                name=None,
                level=None,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                in_axis=False,
            )
            groupings.append(ping)

        if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
            raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
        elif len(groupings) == 0:
            groupings.append(Grouping(Index([], dtype="int"), np.array([], dtype=np.intp)))

    else:
        ping = Grouping(
            group_axis,
            key,
            obj=obj,
            name=None,
            level=None,
            sort=sort,
            observed=observed,
            in_axis=False,
        )
        groupings = [ping]

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

With this correction, the function now correctly handles a list of keys by iterating over them and creating the necessary groupings for each key. This change ensures that the function can handle the failing test cases where `key` is provided as a list.

After applying this fix, the function should pass the failing tests and produce the expected output values.
