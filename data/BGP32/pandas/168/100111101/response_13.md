## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_get_grouper` function when the `level` parameter is not `None`. The function contains a block of code that validates the compatibility of the passed level with the axis of the object. If the condition for a `MultiIndex` is met, it checks if `level` is a list-like object with one element. If this condition matches, it assigns the first element of `level` to `level` itself and retrieves the corresponding level values from `group_axis`. However, if `key` is `None` and `level` is a scalar, it attempts to get the level values from the group axis, but then mistakenly assigns `level` to `key` without clearing `level`.

As a consequence, when the function further executes and encounters the part where it checks for `isinstance(key, Grouper)`, due to the incorrect assignment, it compares the key (which should be the level values) with `obj`. Since the key is actually the level values, the comparison fails, resulting in a `KeyError`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To address the bug in the `_get_grouper` function, the incorrect assignment of `level` to `key` when `key` is `None` and `level` is a scalar needs to be fixed. After obtaining the level values from `group_axis`, `level` should be set back to `None` to ensure that it is not incorrectly used later in the function.

## The corrected function
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # existing function code ...

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            # existing function code ...

    # existing function code ...
    
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle the key assignment and avoid the KeyError in the failing test cases.
