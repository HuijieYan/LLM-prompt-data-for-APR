## Bug Explanation

The bug in the `_get_grouper` function arises due to the condition that raises a `KeyError` when checking for the validity of the `level` parameter. The condition that checks if `isinstance(level, str)` and `obj.index.name != level` is triggering the `ValueError` in the failing test because it doesn't handle the case where `level` is a list with a single string element.

In the case of the failing test where `group_name` is a list `['x']`, the `key` parameter is set to this list, causing the condition `isinstance(level, str)` to fail. As a result, the check `obj.index.name != level` is performed, which triggers the `ValueError` as the comparison is done with a list rather than a string.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition that checks the `level` parameter. Specifically, we should first check if `level` is a list of length 1 with a string element, and if so, extract the string element to compare with `obj.index.name`.

## The Corrected Function

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(level, list) and len(level) == 1 and isinstance(level[0], str):
            level = level[0]

        if key is None and is_scalar(level):
            key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
            level = None

    # Remaining function code remains unchanged
```

By adding the check for a list with a single string element before comparing `level`, we ensure that the condition handles this case correctly and prevents the `ValueError` from occurring.
