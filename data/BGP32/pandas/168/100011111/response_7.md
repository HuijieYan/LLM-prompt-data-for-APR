## Bug Fix Strategy

The bug seems to arise when the key for grouping is provided as a single string or a list of strings representing column names, but the function doesn't handle this case correctly. To fix this bug, the function needs to correctly process the input key(s) representing column names and create the necessary groupings.

### Fixing the Bug

1. Modify the function to handle the case where the key for grouping is a string (single column name) or a list of strings (multiple column names).
2. Update the function to correctly create the groupings based on the provided column names.
3. Ensure that the function correctly groups along the specified axis (0 for index, 1 for columns).
4. Update the function to handle the input parameters and create the groupings accordingly.

By implementing these changes, the function should be able to correctly group the DataFrame along the columns specified by the key(s) and resolve the KeyError issue that was reported in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if key is None:
        # No group keys passed
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = key

    match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # Check validity of level and key overlap
    if level is not None:
        raise ValueError("Specifying level not applicable for column grouping")

    # Create groupings based on column names
    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for i, col_name in enumerate(keys):
        if col_name not in obj.columns:
            raise KeyError(col_name)  # Column name not found in DataFrame columns

        # Create the Grouping
        ping = Grouping(
            group_axis,
            obj[col_name],  # Select the column for grouping
            obj=obj,
            name=col_name,
            level=None,
            sort=sort,
            observed=observed,
            in_axis=True  # Indicate that the column is in the axis
        )

        groupings.append(ping)

    if len(groupings) == 0:
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")

    # Establish the grouper and return
    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

By updating the `_get_grouper` function with the corrected version, the function should now be able to handle grouping along columns using the specified column names, as indicated in the test cases and the GitHub issue.
