## Bug Fix

After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test cases, it is apparent that the issue arises from the incorrect handling of the key when it is a list containing column names. The function fails to interpret the list as keys to group by when passed in this format. To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic in the `_get_grouper` function to correctly handle the case when `key` is a list of column names.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged, only the part where key is handled is updated

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None and not isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):

        if is_list_like(level):
            nlevels = len(level)
            if nlevels == 1:
                level = level[0]
            elif nlevels == 0:
                raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
            else:
                raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

        if isinstance(level, str):
            if obj.index.name != level:
                raise ValueError("level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level))
        elif level > 0 or level < -1:
            raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    any_callable = any(callable(g) or isinstance(g, dict) for g in keys)
    any_groupers = any(isinstance(g, Grouper) for g in keys)
    any_arraylike = any(isinstance(g, (list, tuple, Series, Index, np.ndarray)) for g in keys)

    if (
        not any_callable
        and not any_arraylike
        and not any_groupers
        and match_axis_length
        and level is None
    ):
        if isinstance(obj, DataFrame):
            all_in_columns_index = all(
                g in obj.columns or g in obj.index.names for g in keys
            )
        elif isinstance(obj, Series):
            all_in_columns_index = all(g in obj.index.names for g in keys)

        if not all_in_columns_index:
            keys = [com.asarray_tuplesafe(keys)]

    # Rest of the function remains the same

```

By modifying the key handling logic as shown above, the function should now correctly interpret a list of column names when passed as the key to group by along the specified axis. This correction should resolve the KeyError issue mentioned in the GitHub report and make the function behave as expected in the failing test cases provided.
