## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_get_grouper` function due to the incorrect processing of the `key` parameter when it is a list. The function is designed to handle keys for grouping data, but when `key` is a list, it is not appropriately processed leading to a `KeyError` in certain cases when attempting to group along columns.

The issue arises from the following steps:
1. When the `key` is a list, the function incorrectly processes it as a single key.
2. This incorrect processing results in a KeyError when attempting to get the `level` which should correspond to the column names when grouping along columns.

## Bug Fix
To fix this bug, the logic for handling `key` when it is a list needs to be adjusted. The function should iterate over the elements of the list and construct the groupings accordingly for each element. This modification will ensure that when grouping along columns with a list of keys, the function processes each key correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if key is None:
        key = group_axis

    if isinstance(key, (str, Grouper)):
        key = [key]

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = key

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for key in keys:
        if isinstance(key, Grouper):
            binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
            if key.key is None:
                groupings.append(grouper)
            else:
                groupings.append({key.key})
        elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
            groupings.append(key)
        else:
            if key in obj:
                groupings.append(obj[key])
            else:
                raise KeyError(key)

    if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This corrected version properly handles cases where the `key` is a list, iterating over each element and creating the appropriate groupings based on the elements of the list. This fix ensures that the function behaves as expected when grouping along columns with a list of keys.
