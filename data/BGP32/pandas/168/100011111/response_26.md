## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_grouper` fails to correctly handle the case when the `key` parameter is a list containing a single element. This causes a `KeyError` exception to be raised when attempting to group by a column with a single string value.

### Error Location
The bug is located in the section where the `key` parameter is processed to determine if it contains a single element or a list of elements. This leads to incorrect processing and subsequently causes the `KeyError` exception when trying to group by a single column.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of a list containing a single element in the `key` parameter. The function expects a single element, not a list, but fails to handle this case properly when the key is provided as a list containing a single element.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the scenario where the `key` parameter is a list containing a single element. The function should treat this situation as equivalent to passing the single element directly, allowing the grouping operation to proceed correctly.

### The Corrected Function
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function with the bug fix applied.

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if is_list_like(key):
        if len(key) == 1:
            key = key[0]
        else:
            raise ValueError("multiple keys are not supported, please provide a single key")

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

By implementing this fix, the function will correctly handle cases where the `key` parameter is provided as a list with a single element, ensuring that the grouping operation behaves as expected and does not raise a `KeyError` exception.
