## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_grouper` is not handling the case where the key parameter is a list correctly. It is failing to properly process the string key 'x' or the list key ['x'] as a valid grouping key. This is leading to a KeyError when trying to group by the specified key 'x'.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the inconsistent handling of the key parameter when it is passed as a string ('x') or as a list (['x']). The function is not treating the input key correctly when it is a single string key or a list with a single element.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, you need to ensure that the function can handle both string and list keys consistently. If the key is a string, it should be processed as a single key, and if the key is a list, it should handle each element separately. Additionally, the function should properly interpret the key 'x' as a valid grouping key.

## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
    else:
        keys = [key]

    match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for i, gpr in enumerate(keys):
        # Handle the case when gpr is a single level or column name
        if is_list_like(gpr) and len(gpr) == 1:
            gpr = gpr[0]

        if gpr in group_axis:
            if validate:
                obj._check_label_or_level_ambiguity(gpr)
            name = gpr
            in_axis = True
            gpr = obj[gpr]
            exclusions.append(name)
        else:
            in_axis = False
            name = None

        if not is_scalar(gpr) and not all(is_hashable(t) for t in gpr):
            msg = "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than a single key."
            msg += " Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In the future, a tuple will always mean a single key."
            warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)

        ping = Grouping(
            group_axis,
            gpr,
            obj=obj,
            name=name,
            level=level,
            sort=sort,
            observed=observed,
            in_axis=in_axis,
        )

        groupings.append(ping)

    if not groupings:
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In the corrected version of the function, we explicitly handle the case for a list of keys and ensure that each key is processed correctly. Additionally, we address the warning message display when a tuple key is provided.

By fixing the handling of the key parameter in the function, we can address the KeyError issue and enable proper grouping functionality based on the input keys.
