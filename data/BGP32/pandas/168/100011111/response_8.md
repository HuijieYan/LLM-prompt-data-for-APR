### Bug Analysis:
1. The function `_get_grouper()` is failing to correctly handle grouping by column name when passed as a string or list of strings for 'key' and when grouping is done along axis=1.
2. The function encounters a `KeyError` when trying to group by column name 'x' due to the incorrect handling of the column name during the grouping process.
3. The function should properly interpret the 'key' parameter as a column name when performing grouping along the columns.
4. The failure occurs because the function doesn't appropriately handle the column name as a key for grouping along columns.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if the 'key' provided is a valid column name in the DataFrame when performing grouping along the columns axis.
2. Ensure that the function correctly identifies and processes the column name provided for grouping along columns to avoid the `KeyError`.
3. Update the logic to interpret the 'key' parameter as a column name when grouping is performed along the columns axis.

### Updated Function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    if axis == 1 and isinstance(key, str):
        if key not in obj.columns:
            raise KeyError(key)
        keys = [key]
    elif axis == 1 and isinstance(key, list):
        if not all(k in obj.columns for k in key):
            raise KeyError(key)
        keys = key
    else:
        keys = [key] if not isinstance(key, list) else key

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Other existing code remains the same below...
```

By implementing this fix, the function will correctly interpret the column name provided for grouping along the columns axis, resolving the `KeyError` issue encountered during the grouping process.
