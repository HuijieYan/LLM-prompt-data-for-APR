### Analysis:
- The error occurs when trying to group by column names in the `df.groupby(group_name, axis=1).sum()` statement.
- The `_get_grouper` function is responsible for handling the grouping logic and seems to have issues when passed column names for grouping.
- The error message indicates a `KeyError` for the column name 'x', which is the group name being used.
- The GitHub issue highlights a similar problem where grouping by column names doesn't work as expected.

### Bug Cause:
- The `_get_grouper` function doesn't properly handle the case of grouping by column names.
- The logic in the function is complex and doesn't account for grouping by column labels correctly, leading to the `KeyError`.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Check the logic for column-based grouping in the `_get_grouper` function.
2. Ensure that when grouping by column names, the function correctly handles this scenario.
3. Update the function to address the specific case of grouping by column labels.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if key in obj:
        key = obj[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, str) and key in obj.columns:
        key = obj[key]

    # Rest of the function remains the same...

```

Applying this change should address the issue with grouping by column names. The corrected function should now properly handle column-based grouping.
