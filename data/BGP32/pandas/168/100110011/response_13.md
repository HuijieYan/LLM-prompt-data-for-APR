### Analysis:
The bug in the `_get_grouper` function is causing a `KeyError` when trying to group by a column name using `groupby(by="x", axis=1).sum()`. The current implementation is not handling the case of grouping by column names correctly.

The core issue seems to be the handling of grouping by column names within the function `_get_grouper`. The function is designed to handle various cases for creating groupers, but it fails to properly identify and process grouping by column names.

### Bug Cause:
The function `_get_grouper` does not handle the case of grouping by column names correctly. It fails to differentiate between grouping by columns and other types of keys, leading to the `KeyError` when trying to group by a column name.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles grouping by column names. This involves correctly identifying column names as keys for grouping and processing them accordingly. Additionally, we should ensure that the function can differentiate between grouping by columns and other key types to avoid errors.

### Bug Fix for the `_get_grouper` Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if key is None:
        key = group_axis if axis == 1 else group_axis.labels

    if isinstance(key, str):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
    else:
        keys = [key]

    levels = [level] * len(keys)

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for i, (gpr, level) in enumerate(zip(keys, levels):
        ping = Grouping(
            group_axis,
            gpr,
            obj=obj,
            name=None,
            level=level,
            sort=sort,
            observed=observed,
            in_axis=True if axis == 1 else False,
        )

        groupings.append(ping)

    if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
    elif len(groupings) == 0:
        groupings.append(Grouping(Index([], dtype="int"), np.array([], dtype=np.intp)))

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This corrected version ensures that when grouping by columns (`axis=1`), it correctly identifies the columns as keys for grouping. Additionally, it handles the creation of Grouping objects for each column name specified for grouping.

By fixing these issues in the `_get_grouper` function, the `KeyError` should be resolved when attempting to group by column names using `groupby(by="x", axis=1).sum()`.
