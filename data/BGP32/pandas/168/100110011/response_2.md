### Bug Fix Analysis:
- The issue lies in the `_get_grouper` function where it fails to handle the case when the `key` value is a single element list.
- The function throws a `KeyError` when attempting to group by the value in the list, causing the test to fail.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the function does not correctly handle the case when `key` is a single element list, assuming it is an actual key instead of a list of keys.

### Suggested Fix Strategy:
- We need to modify the logic in the `_get_grouper` function to handle the case when `key` is a list with a single element correctly.
- Verify if `key` is a list and extract the value from the list to handle the grouping.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    Implementation of the _get_grouper function with bug fixed related to the grouping keys.
    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Handle the case when key is a single element list
    if isinstance(key, list) and len(key) == 1:
        key = key[0]

    # Rest of the function remains the same

    # Then continue with the rest of the function logic

```

After applying this fix, the `_get_grouper` function should now handle the case when `key` is a single element list correctly and avoid the `KeyError` when grouping.
