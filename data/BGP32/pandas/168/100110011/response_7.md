## Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_grouper` is responsible for creating a `BaseGrouper` object based on the passed parameters including `key`, `axis`, `level`, etc.
2. The failing test `test_groupby_axis_1` tries to group the DataFrame `df` by the column names when `group_name` is passed as a string or a list of column names.
3. The error message indicates a `KeyError` is raised when trying to group by the column names, specifically for the column name "x".
4. The GitHub issue points out that grouping along columns does not work as expected when using `groupby(by="x", axis=1)`.

## Bug Explanation:
1. The bug occurs because the function does not handle the scenario where `key` is supposed to represent the column name, resulting in a `KeyError`.
2. In the buggy function, the logic for checking if the `key` is in the object and resolving it appropriately is flawed, leading to the error.
3. The bug prevents successful grouping by columns in the provided test case.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic in the `_get_grouper` function to correctly handle the case where `key` represents a column name.
2. Ensure that the function correctly identifies column names, resolves them to the corresponding data, and proceeds with grouping without raising a `KeyError`.
3. The fix should allow the function to group by column names as intended in the failing test.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if is_list_like(level):
            level = level[0] if len(level) == 1 else level

        if key is None and is_scalar(level):
            key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
            level = None

    if isinstance(key, str):
        if key not in obj.columns:
            raise KeyError(key)
        key = obj[key]

    # other existing logic remains unchanged

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

By making the above adjustments to the `_get_grouper` function, the bug causing the `KeyError` when grouping by column names should be resolved, and the failing test should pass successfully.
