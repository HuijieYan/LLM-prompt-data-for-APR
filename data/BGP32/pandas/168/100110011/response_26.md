### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_grouper` fails when trying to group along columns using the column labels in the DataFrame. The bug causes a KeyError to be raised even when the column label explicitly exists.

The root cause of the bug lies in the logic for handling the grouping by columns. The function incorrectly processes the keys for grouping when provided as column labels, leading to the KeyError during the execution.

### Bug Location
The error occurs in the logic related to identifying the grouping keys and processing them correctly, specifically when the function is trying to determine if the provided key for grouping exists in the DataFrame.

### Bug Explanation
The bug arises from the function's incorrect handling of column label keys during grouping. The function fails to recognize the column label as a valid key for grouping, resulting in the KeyError. This issue prevents the correct grouping of data along columns based on the specified key.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function `_get_grouper` needs to be modified to correctly handle the case where grouping is done along columns using the column labels. The key for grouping by columns should be properly identified and processed to avoid the KeyError.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Existing code omitted for brevity

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = key

    all_in_columns_index = all(g in obj.columns for g in keys)
    all_in_index_names = all(g in obj.index.names for g in keys)

    if all_in_columns_index or all_in_index_names:
        group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

        if match_axis_length and level is None:
            all_keys_present = all(k in group_axis for k in keys)
            if all_keys_present:
                keys = [com.asarray_tuplesafe(keys)]

    # Existing code omitted for brevity
```

This corrected version includes changes to properly determine if the provided keys for grouping by columns are valid column labels in the DataFrame. The modifications aim to ensure that the keys used for grouping along columns are correctly processed and do not raise KeyError.

By implementing this fix, the `_get_grouper` function should now correctly handle grouping by columns using the column labels present in the DataFrame, resolving the issue and passing the failing test cases.
