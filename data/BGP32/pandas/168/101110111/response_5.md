Based on the analysis of the buggy function, the issue reported on GitHub, and the failing test cases provided, the bug is related to how the function handles grouping by columns when the `key` parameter is given as a string. The bug results in a `KeyError` when trying to group along columns.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `_get_grouper` function to properly handle grouping by columns when the `key` is a string. Currently, the function tries to access the column specified by the string key, which results in a `KeyError` as the key is intended to represent a column label.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        # Simplified the condition block for MultiIndex type
        if not isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("Multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.columns.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    if isinstance(key, str):
        # Handle string key as column label
        if key in obj:
            key = obj[key]

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # Proceed with the rest of the code as given in the original function

    # ...

``` 

By checking if the `key` is a string and converting it to the corresponding column object if it exists in the DataFrame, we can ensure that the function correctly handles grouping by columns using the specified column label.

This correction should address the KeyError issue encountered when trying to group along columns using a string key in the failing test cases provided.
