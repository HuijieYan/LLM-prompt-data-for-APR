## Correction of the buggy function

The issue in the buggy function arises due to the incorrect handling of the `key` parameter, which should signify the column label(s) to group by when `axis=1`. To fix this issue, we need to index the DataFrame columns correctly based on the provided `key` parameter.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Check if key is a string or a list for column indexing
    if isinstance(key, str):
        key = [key]

    if level is None and key is not None:
        # Validate that all keys are present in the columns
        if any(k not in obj.columns for k in key):
            raise KeyError(f"Key(s) {key} not found in columns.")

    # Create Grouping based on columns provided in key
    groupings = [Grouping(group_axis, obj[k], obj=obj, name=k, level=None, sort=sort, observed=observed, in_axis=True) for k in key]

    # Create the internals grouper
    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, [], obj
```

This corrected version handles the case where the `key` is a single column label or a list of column labels correctly. It creates Grouping objects based on the provided columns and returns the necessary values for the GroupBy operation. The key difference here is the correct indexing of columns using the `key` parameter before creating the Groupings. This fix should address the issue and allow the function to correctly handle grouping based on columns.

By applying this correction, the `_get_grouper` function should now behave as expected, allowing successful grouping by columns when `axis=1`.
