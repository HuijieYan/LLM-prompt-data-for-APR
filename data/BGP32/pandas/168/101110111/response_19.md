## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_grouper` is responsible for creating a `BaseGrouper` object based on the input parameters, such as `obj`, `key`, `axis`, `level`, `sort`, `observed`, `mutated`, and `validate`. The issue seems to be related to the grouping of columns when specifying `axis=1`, as reported in the GitHub issue.

The function handles different scenarios for the input parameters, including checking for key overlaps and creating groupings based on the provided key values. The error occurs during the process of determining the groupings for the columns when grouping along `axis=1`.

The bug seems to stem from the logic in the section that processes the keys when grouping along the columns. The function is not correctly identifying the column label `x` as a valid key for grouping along `axis=1`, resulting in a `KeyError`.

## Bug Explanation
The bug arises when the function `_get_grouper` is called with the `axis=1` parameter for grouping along columns. The function fails to correctly handle column labels or keys when grouping in this manner. This results in a `KeyError` being raised for the provided key `'x'` when attempting to group along `axis=1`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to update the logic in the `_get_grouper` function to correctly identify and process the keys when grouping along columns (`axis=1`). This may involve modifying the code related to identifying the keys, handling the column labels, and ensuring that the grouping process for columns works as intended.

Let's correct the bug in the function `_get_grouper` to ensure it properly handles grouping along columns when specifying `axis=1`.

## Bug-fixed Function
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps

    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if axis == 1:
        if key is not None:
            # handle specific key value for grouping along columns
            if isinstance(key, str):
                key = [key]
        else:
            key = group_axis

    # rest of the function remains the same

    # create the internals grouper
    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

By updating the logic to correctly handle the key values for grouping along columns, the function should now properly handle the specified column labels when grouping along `axis=1`. This fix should address the `KeyError` issue reported in the GitHub bug.
