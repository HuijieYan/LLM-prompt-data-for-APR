Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the provided runtime input/output values, expected input/output values, and the GitHub issue, the bug arises from the incorrect handling of grouping by columns when the `key` parameter is provided as a string or list of strings denoting columns, indicated by `axis=1`. The function expects the `key` to be a list of keys, but the code does not handle this correctly.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to properly handle grouping by columns. Specifically, when grouping by columns, the `key` parameter should be transformed into a list of keys before processing.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if key is not None and not isinstance(key, list):
        key = [key]  # Transform single key into a list

    # Rest of the function remains the same

    # a passed-in Grouper, directly convert
    if any(isinstance(k, Grouper) for k in key):
        groupers = []
        for k in key:
            binner, grouper, obj = k._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
            if k.key is not None:
                groupers.append({k.key})
        return BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupers, sort=sort, mutated=mutated), [], obj
    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj

    # Rest of the function remains the same

```

This updated version will correctly handle grouping by columns when a single column name is provided as the `key`. The code now transforms the `key` parameter into a list if it is not already a list before processing.

By making this change, the function should now correctly group by columns using the provided column names, resolving the bug identified in the GitHub issue.
