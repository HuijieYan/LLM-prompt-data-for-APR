The issue described on GitHub points out a problem with the behavior of `groupby` when trying to group along columns using column names. The function `_get_grouper` in the `grouper.py` file has a bug that causes the KeyError when trying to group along columns.

**Bug Explanation:**
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of grouping along columns in the `_get_grouper` function. When the function tries to group by column names, it encounters the issue with the key selection process and raises a KeyError.

**Bug Fix Strategy:**
To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the case where grouping is done along columns using column names. We should ensure that the key selection process for grouping along columns is accurate and does not lead to errors like KeyError.

**Code Fix:**
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function to resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub problem:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
                
            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None

        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.columns.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "level name {} is not the name of the columns".format(level)
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

        if match_axis_length:
            all_in_columns_index = all(g in obj.columns for g in keys)
            if not all_in_columns_index:
                keys = [com.asarray_tuplesafe(keys)]
    else:
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False

    any_callable = any(callable(g) or isinstance(g, dict) for g in keys)
    any_groupers = any(isinstance(g, Grouper) for g in keys)
    any_arraylike = any(
        isinstance(g, (list, tuple, Series, Index, np.ndarray)) for g in keys
    )

    if not any_callable and not any_arraylike and not any_groupers and match_axis_length and level is None:
        if isinstance(obj, DataFrame):
            all_in_columns_index = all(
                g in obj.columns for g in keys
            )
        if not all_in_columns_index:
            keys = [com.asarray_tuplesafe(keys)]

    if isinstance(level, (tuple, list)):
        if key is None:
            keys = [None] * len(level)
        levels = level
    else:
        levels = [level] * len(keys)

    # remaining implementation unchanged
```

By making these corrections in the `_get_grouper` function, the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved, and the function should now correctly handle the grouping along columns without raising KeyErrors.
