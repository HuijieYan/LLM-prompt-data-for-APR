Based on the bug described in the GitHub issue, the problem lies in the `_get_grouper` function where the grouping by columns doesn't work as expected. The function fails to handle grouping by columns correctly, leading to KeyError exceptions.

### Bug Analysis:
- The function fails to properly handle grouping by columns.
- The code in the function does not correctly process the "key" parameter for grouping by columns.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug arises due to incorrect handling of grouping by columns.
- The key parameter is not appropriately processed in cases where grouping by columns is required.

### Fix Strategy:
- Update the logic within the function to correctly handle grouping by columns.
- Modify the workflow to ensure that the key parameter is correctly interpreted for grouping by columns.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function considering the described issue and expected input/output values:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        # Check if key is present
        if key is None:
            key = level
        
    # Logic for grouping by columns
    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    for gpr in keys:
        # Check if gpr is a valid column
        if gpr not in obj.columns:
            raise KeyError(gpr)

    groupings = [Grouping(group_axis, gpr, obj=obj) for gpr in keys]

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, [], obj
```

This corrected version should now handle grouping by columns correctly by correctly processing the key parameters passed in for columns. It ensures that the key corresponds to valid columns for grouping purposes.

Please test the corrected function with the provided test cases to verify that it now handles grouping by columns as expected and resolves the bug.
