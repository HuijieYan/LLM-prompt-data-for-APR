The bug in the `_get_grouper` function lies in the logic for handling the `key` parameter when it is passed as a list. The function incorrectly processes the list, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling list-like `key` parameters. Specifically, we need to ensure that the code correctly interprets a list of keys when `key` is passed as a list, instead of assuming it is a single key.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
# Import statements omitted for brevity

def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Same function body as before, with the following adjustments

    # Check if key is a list-like object
    if is_list_like(key):
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

        # what are we after, exactly?
        any_callable = any(callable(g) or isinstance(g, dict) for g in keys)
        any_groupers = any(isinstance(g, Grouper) for g in keys)
        any_arraylike = any(
            isinstance(g, (list, tuple, Series, Index, np.ndarray)) for g in keys
        )

        if (
            not any_callable
            and not any_arraylike
            and not any_groupers
            and match_axis_length
            and level is None
        ):
            if isinstance(obj, DataFrame):
                all_in_columns_index = all(
                    g in obj.columns or g in obj.index.names for g in keys
                )
            elif isinstance(obj, Series):
                all_in_columns_index = all(g in obj.index.names for g in keys)

            if not all_in_columns_index:
                keys = [com.asarray_tuplesafe(keys)]

    # Rest of the function remains the same

```

With these modifications, the function will correctly handle cases where `key` is a list of keys. This should resolve the bugs mentioned in the failing test cases.

Please replace the buggy function in your codebase with the corrected version provided above.
