Based on the provided buggy function and the failing test cases, the issue seems to be related to how the `key` parameter is handled in the `_get_grouper` function. The function expects the `key` to be a single value, but in some cases, it is passed as a list.

To fix the bug:
1. Ensure that the `key` parameter is always a single value, even if it is initially provided as a list.
2. If `key` is a list, convert it to a single value by taking the first element.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # handle the case where key is a list
    if isinstance(key, list):
        key = key[0]

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # validate that the passed single level is compatible with the passed
    # axis of the object
    if level is not None:
        # TODO: These if-block and else-block are almost same.
        # MultiIndex instance check is removable, but it seems that there are
        # some processes only for non-MultiIndex in else-block,
        # eg. `obj.index.name != level`. We have to consider carefully whether
        # these are applicable for MultiIndex. Even if these are applicable,
        # we need to check if it makes no side effect to subsequent processes
        # on the outside of this condition.
        # (GH 17621)
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                # Get the level values from group_axis
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None

        else:
            # allow level to be a length-one list-like object
            # (e.g., level=[0])
            # GH 13901
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            # NOTE: `group_axis` and `group_axis.get_level_values(level)`
            # are same in this section.
            level = None
            key = group_axis

    # rest of the function remains the same...

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This fix should handle the cases where the `key` parameter is mistakenly passed as a list, ensuring that it is always a single value before further processing.
