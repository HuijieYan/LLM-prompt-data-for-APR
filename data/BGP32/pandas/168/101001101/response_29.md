The bug in the `_get_grouper` function seems to be related to the way the `key` parameter is handled. The function expects the `key` parameter to be either a single key or a list of keys, but in some cases, the key is passed as a tuple instead of a list. This discrepancy causes issues in the process, leading to unexpected behavior. 

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `key` parameter is always interpreted as a list of keys, even when passed as a tuple. Additionally, we should handle cases where `key` is already a `Grouper` or a `BaseGrouper` appropriately.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps

    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    keys = key if isinstance(key, list) else [key]
    
    if any(isinstance(k, Grouper) for k in keys):
        groupers = [k._get_grouper(obj, validate=False) for k in keys]
        return Grouping(group_axis, key, obj=obj), set(key.key for k in groupers if k.key is not None), obj
    elif any(isinstance(k, BaseGrouper) for k in keys):
        return key, [], obj
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        keys = list(key)
        msg = (
            "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than "
            "a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In "
            "the future, a tuple will always mean a single key."
        )
        warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
    
    # remaining implementation...
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the `key` parameter is always treated as a list by converting tuples to lists when necessary. Additionally, it correctly handles cases where `key` is already a `Grouper` or a `BaseGrouper`.

Please test this corrected version with the cases provided to ensure it now produces the expected outputs.
