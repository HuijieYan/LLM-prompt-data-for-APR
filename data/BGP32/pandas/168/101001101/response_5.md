The buggy function fails to properly handle the case when `key` is a single item list. The issue arises in the logic that processes the key in the `if not isinstance(key, list)` block. It should correctly handle the key as a list when its length is one.

To fix this bug, we can modify the logic where the types of `key` are checked. Instead of treating a single-item list key differently, we should handle all types of keys consistently as lists.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # previous function implementation
    
    # ensure key is a list for consistency
    if key is not None and not isinstance(key, list):
        key = [key]
    
    # rest of the function logic remains the same

    # create the internals grouper
    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This modification ensures that regardless of the key being passed, it will always be handled as a list in the function. This fix should address the issues with single-item keys and provide consistent behavior.
