### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_grouper` function arises when processing the `level` parameter under certain conditions, such as when the `group_axis` is a `MultiIndex`. The bug results in incorrect handling of the `level`, leading to unexpected behavior.

The bug can be traced back to the block of code that performs different operations based on whether the `group_axis` is an instance of a `MultiIndex` or not. The code tries to handle multiple cases for `level` based on its type or values, but due to the different scenarios and potential pitfalls, the logic becomes convoluted and prone to errors.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_get_grouper` function, we will simplify the conditional blocks regarding the handling of `level`. We will create a more straightforward and concise approach to handle `level` consistently, regardless of the type of `group_axis`. By streamlining the logic and ensuring clarity, we can prevent the bug from occurring.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if isinstance(level, (list, tuple)) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
                
            if is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if isinstance(level, (list, tuple)):
                if len(level) == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif len(level) == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("Multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError("Level name '{}' is not the name of the index".format(level))
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("Level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")
            
            level = None
            key = group_axis

    # Remaining code block unchanged
    ...
```

By simplifying the `level` processing logic, we ensure consistent handling of this parameter and prevent the bug from occurring. The corrected function provides a more robust and maintainable solution.
