After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test cases, it seems that the issue lies in the handling of the `level` parameter when it is a list-like object with length greater than 1. The function is not correctly handling this scenario, leading to errors in the test cases provided.

To address this issue and fix the bug, we need to update the logic related to the `level` parameter processing. Specifically, we need to ensure that when `level` is a list-like object with a length greater than 1, the function should raise a `ValueError` indicating that multiple levels are not supported unless it is a `MultiIndex`.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                if len(level) != 1:
                    raise ValueError("Multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")
                level = level[0]

    # the rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

By making this change, the function will now correctly handle multiple levels and raise an error if the `level` parameter contains more than one level when not using a `MultiIndex`.

This correction should resolve the issues with the failing test cases provided.
