### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_get_grouper` function where the key parameter handling for grouping along columns is incorrect. The issue lies specifically in the condition where the key is checked for MultiIndex instances. This check causes problems with single-level keys when grouping along columns, leading to KeyErrors.

### Bug Explanation
1. In Case 1, the key is `'x'` which is a single-level key.
2. The buggy function incorrectly processes this key for MultiIndex, leading to inappropriate validations and eventually a KeyError.
3. This issue is directly related to the GitHub problem where grouping along columns is affected by the handling of single-level keys.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Adjust the conditional checks related to MultiIndex instances to allow correct handling of single-level keys for grouping along columns.
2. Ensure that the key passed is correctly interpreted and processed when grouping along columns to avoid KeyErrors.
3. Update the logic to differentiate between single-level and MultiIndex keys for accurate handling.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None

        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj

    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj

    # Updated logic for handling key for grouping along columns
    elif axis == 1 and not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        keys = list(key)
    else:
        keys = key

    ...
```

By updating the key processing logic and making necessary adjustments for single-level keys, the corrected function ensures proper handling when grouping along columns. This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub and resolves the bug in `_get_grouper`.
