### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_grouper` is responsible for creating a grouping object within the Pandas library. The function looks for key-related information, manipulates it, and creates a `BaseGrouper`. In the given GitHub issue, the problem arises when trying to group along columns using the `groupby` method, resulting in a `KeyError`.

### Bug Cause:
1. In the function, there is an issue where the condition for selecting columns when grouping along the columns axis is not handled correctly. This leads to a KeyError when trying to group by columns.
2. The condition to identify the columns to group by is not properly checking and handling scenarios for columns as keys.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Correctly handle the scenario where the key is meant to represent columns while grouping along the columns axis.
2. Ensure that the columns are correctly identified and processed as keys for grouping.
3. Adjust the key handling mechanism to allow for grouping by columns as intended.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # validate that the passed single level is compatible with the passed
    # axis of the object
    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None

        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if is_categorical_dtype(level) and obj.index.name != level.name:
                raise ValueError("level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level.name))

            if not is_list_like(level):
                level = [level]

            if level[0] > 0 or level[0] < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    if isinstance(key, list) and isinstance(key[0], str):
        key = [key]

    keys = key if isinstance(key, list) else [key]

    if not all(isinstance(k, str) for k in keys):
        keys = [k.name for k in keys]

    level = None

    groupings = []

    for k in keys:
        if k in obj:
            group = obj[k].copy()
            if validate:
                obj._check_label_or_level_ambiguity(k)
            group.name = k
            groupings.append(Grouping(group_axis, group, obj=obj, name=k, level=level, sort=sort, observed=observed, in_axis=True))

    if not groupings:
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, [], obj
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the issue of grouping along columns by modifying how columns are handled as keys for grouping, ensuring that columns can be properly selected and processed during grouping operations.
