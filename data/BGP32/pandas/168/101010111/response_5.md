## Proposed Fix

The issue stems from the incorrect handling of the `key` parameter in the `_get_grouper` function. The `key` parameter should be converted to a list if it is not already a list before proceeding with creating Groupings.

### Fix:
1. Check if `key` is not a list, convert it to a list.
2. Update the logic to create Groupings according to the corrected `key` list.

```python
def _get_grouper(obj, key=None, axis=0, level=None, sort=True, observed=False, mutated=False, validate=True):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps

    """

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        key = [key]

    # what are we after, exactly?
    any_callable = any(callable(g) or isinstance(g, dict) for g in keys)
    any_groupers = any(isinstance(g, Grouper) for g in key)
    any_arraylike = any(isinstance(g, (list, tuple, Series, Index, np.ndarray)) for g in key)

    # create groupings based on corrected key list
    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for i, (gpr, level) in enumerate(zip(key, levels)):
        # rest of the function implementation remains the same

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

By correcting the handling of the `key` parameter and ensuring it is always treated as a list, the function will create the Groupings correctly and avoid the KeyError issue mentioned in the GitHub thread.
