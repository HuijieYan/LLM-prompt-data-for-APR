## Solution

### Issue Analysis
The issue stems from the `_get_grouper` function not correctly handling the case where the `key` parameter is a list. In the failing test cases, the `key` parameter value is a list `['x']`, which is not handled properly in the function, leading to a `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, the function needs to handle cases where the `key` parameter is a list containing column names correctly. Instead of assuming `key` is a single value, the function should iterate over the list if `key` is a list-like object. This modification will allow proper handling of column name grouping when provided as a list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Function body remains the same, except for the key handling logic below

    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)
    else:
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False

    # rest of the code remains the same

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

By making this change, the function will correctly handle the case where the `key` parameter is a list of column names, and the KeyError issue should be resolved.

This correction ensures that the function appropriately processes the list-like `key` parameter for column name grouping.

After applying this fix, the updated function should pass all the test cases and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
