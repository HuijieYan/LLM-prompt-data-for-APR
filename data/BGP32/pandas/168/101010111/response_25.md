## Correction of the buggy function

I will make corrections to the `_get_grouper` function to handle the group keys properly when grouping along columns. The key issue in the provided function lies in the incorrect handling of the group keys passed as a list in the `key` parameter. By converting the list of keys into a single key, we can properly group along the specified columns.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    if isinstance(key, list):
        key = tuple(key)  # Convert list of keys into a tuple

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
    
    if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex) and is_list_like(key):
        if len(key) == 1 and is_scalar(key[0]):
            key = key[0]

    if key not in obj:
        key = com._asarray_tuplesafe(key)
    
    # Other parts of the function remain the same
    
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

With this correction, the function should now properly handle the list of keys provided when grouping along columns, ensuring correct grouping behavior as expected. This change addresses the underlying issue raised in the GitHub bug report.
