Based on the analysis of the bug, it appears that the issue lies in the `_is_label_like` function, which is used to determine if a key is present in the data. This function is not correctly handling the case when the key is a column name, leading to a KeyError when trying to group by columns.

To fix this bug, the `_is_label_like` function needs to be updated to correctly identify column names. Additionally, the condition for checking if a key is a label-like object should be adjusted to handle column names appropriately.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
    
    if level is not None:
        if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
            level = level[0]
    
        if key is None and is_scalar(level):
            key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
            level = None
    
    if isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj
    
    is_tuple = isinstance(key, tuple)
    all_hashable = is_tuple and is_hashable(key)
    
    if is_tuple:
        if (all_hashable and not set(key).issubset(obj)) or not all_hashable:
            msg = "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'"
            warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
            key = list(key)
    
    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = key
    
    for key in keys:
        if key not in obj:
            column_idx = obj.columns.get_loc(key)
            obj._data.items.get_loc(column_idx)
    
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This corrected version should address the bug and allow the function to group by column names without raising a KeyError as shown in the failing test cases.
