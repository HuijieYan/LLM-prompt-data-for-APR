Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing tests, it seems that the issue stems from the `_get_grouper` function not correctly handling the case where the `key` parameter is a list of strings representing column names (as in the failing test cases). The function seems to expect a single key, causing the KeyError because it cannot find a single key matching the list of column names.

To fix this issue, the `_get_grouper` function should be adjusted to handle the case where `key` is a list of strings representing column names correctly. It should iterate over the list of keys and create a Grouping object for each column name.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(key, str):
        key = [key]

    if key is not None:
        keys = key
    else:
        if axis == 0:
            keys = obj.index
        else:
            keys = obj.columns

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for i, gpr in enumerate(keys):
        if axis == 0 and gpr not in obj.index:
            raise KeyError(gpr)
        if axis == 1 and gpr not in obj.columns:
            raise KeyError(gpr)

        ping = Grouping(
            group_axis,
            gpr,
            obj=obj,
            name=gpr,
            level=level,
            sort=sort,
            observed=observed,
            in_axis=True,
        )
        groupings.append(ping)

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

With this correction, the `_get_grouper` function should now correctly handle grouping by multiple columns names when a list of strings is provided as the `key` parameter.

Please test the corrected function with the failing test cases to ensure that the issue is resolved. Let me know if you encounter any further issues.
