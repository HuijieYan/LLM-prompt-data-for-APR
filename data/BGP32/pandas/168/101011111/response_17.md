Based on the analysis and the provided information, the issue in the `_get_grouper` function seems to be caused by the mismatch in handling key as a list when it should be treated as a single key for grouping. To fix this bug, we can adjust the function to correctly handle the key when it's a list. Below is the corrected version of the _get_grouper function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Body of the function remains the same as the previous version until this point

    # Correction for handling key if it's a list
    if isinstance(key, list):
        if len(key) == 1:
            key = key[0]
    
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
    
    # Validate that the passed single level is compatible with the passed axis of the object
    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None

        else:
            # Remainder of the function stays the same

    # Rest of the function remains the same as the previous version

```

By making this adjustment, the _get_grouper function will correctly handle the key parameter when it's a list, ensuring that the grouping operation is done correctly. This fix should resolve the KeyError issue in the failing test cases and align with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.
