I will first analyze the buggy function and the failing test cases to identify the issue and provide a solution to fix it.

### Issue analysis:
1. The failing test cases involve grouping a DataFrame by columns using the `groupby` function with `axis=1`.
2. However, the current implementation of the `_get_grouper` function in the pandas codebase does not handle grouping by column names properly, leading to a `KeyError` when trying to group by column names.
3. The failure occurs because the function expects `key` to be a list, but when a single column name is passed as `key`, it is not automatically converted to a list.
4. The function does not handle grouping by column names as expected, resulting in an error.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `_get_grouper` function to handle cases where the `key` parameter is a single column name (string) by converting it to a list before further processing.
2. ensure that the function correctly distinguishes between grouping by index and grouping by columns.
3. This modification should allow the function to group by column names successfully without raising a `KeyError`.

### Bug-fixed version of the function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Check if key is None or a scalar; if so, convert it to a list
    if key is not None and is_scalar(key):
        key = [key]

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # The rest of the function remains unchanged...
```

This modification ensures that the `key` parameter is correctly handled as a list if it is a single column name. This change should resolve the `KeyError` issue when grouping by column names.
