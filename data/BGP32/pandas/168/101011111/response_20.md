Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the provided failing test cases, it seems that the issue lies in the `_get_grouper` function's logic when handling the key parameter for grouping by columns.

The bug causes a KeyError to be raised when trying to group by columns using the column name. This happens because when the key is a single string representing a column name, it fails to correctly handle this case and consequently raises an error.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `_get_grouper` function that handles the grouping by columns.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
        if isinstance(key, str):
            key = (key,)

    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        if all(is_hashable(item) for item in key):
            key = list(key)
            if key not in obj and set(key).issubset(obj):
                msg = "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than a single key."
                warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = key

    # Rest of the function's logic remains the same

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This corrected version includes a modification to correctly handle the case when grouping by columns using a single string as the key parameter. It converts the single string key into a list before moving forward with the grouping logic.

By applying this fix, the `_get_grouper` function should now handle grouping by columns without raising a KeyError, ensuring that the expected output is achieved for the given test cases.
