## Bug Explanation

The bug in the `_get_grouper` function arises from the condition where a `KeyError` is raised when trying to group by a column name ('x') in the case of specifying `axis=1`. This issue is due to the handling of the `key` parameter in the function, specifically when it's a single-element list `['x']`.

In the buggy function, the keys are meant to represent the columns or keys used for grouping. However, when `key` is passed as `['x']`, it attempts to retrieve the value 'x' which leads to the `KeyError` exception, as it gets interpreted as an index or row label, not a column label.

## Fix Strategy

To fix the bug in the `_get_grouper` function, the handling of the `key` parameter when it's a list containing a single element needs to be adjusted. The correct behavior should involve recognizing that in the case of grouping along `axis=1`, the elements in the list should represent column labels. Therefore, the function should appropriately process the column label 'x' when it's provided as `['x']`.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function that addresses the issue described above. 

## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
from pandas.core.groupby.grouper import Grouper
from pandas.core.groupby.grouping import Grouping

def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # New logic for handling key as a list with a single column name
    if isinstance(key, list) and len(key) == 1:
        key = key[0]

    # Existing logic continues...

    # if the actual grouper should be obj[key] or obj[name]
    def is_in_axis(key):
        if not _is_label_like(key):
            try:
                obj._data.items.get_loc(key)
            except Exception:
                return False

        return True

    # if the grouper is obj[name]
    def is_in_obj(gpr):
        try:
            return id(gpr) == id(obj[gpr.name])
        except Exception:
            return False

    for i, (gpr, level) in enumerate(zip(keys, levels)):
        if isinstance(key, str):  # New check to handle 'x' as a string
            gpr = key

        if is_in_obj(gpr):
            in_axis, name = True, gpr.name
            exclusions.append(name)

        # Existing logic continues...

        groupings.append(ping)

    if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
    elif len(groupings) == 0:
        groupings.append(Grouping(Index([], dtype="int"), np.array([], dtype=np.intp)))

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

By incorporating the new logic to handle the case of `key` being a list with a single column name ('x'), the corrected function should now correctly group by column names when `axis=1` is specified. This adjustment ensures that the behavior aligns with the expected grouping by column labels as requested in the provided GitHub issue.
