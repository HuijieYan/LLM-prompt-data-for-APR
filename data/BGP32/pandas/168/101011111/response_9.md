Based on the provided information, it seems that the issue lies in the `_get_grouper` function which fails to properly handle the grouping by column name when using `groupby`, resulting in a `KeyError`. The function should correctly interpret the column name and group along that axis. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function properly interprets the input key as a column label when grouping along columns.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Create BaseGrouper object
    base_grouper = BaseGrouper(obj._get_axis(axis), [], sort=sort, mutated=mutated)

    # If key is a single string and grouping along columns
    if isinstance(key, str) and axis == 1:
        if key in obj:
            key_name = key  # Store the column name
            key = obj[key]  # Get the column values

    # Including existing code (modified if necessary) below:
    ...
```

This modification ensures that when grouping along columns (`axis=1`), if the key is a string, it is interpreted as a column label and the corresponding column values are used for grouping.

By incorporating the above correction, the `_get_grouper` function should now handle column label grouping correctly and resolve the `KeyError` issue when attempting to group along columns by the column name.

After implementing this fix, you can re-run the failing test cases to verify that the corrected function now behaves as expected and that the issue reported in the GitHub thread "GroupBy(axis=1) Does Not Offer Implicit Selection By Columns Name(s)" has been addressed.
