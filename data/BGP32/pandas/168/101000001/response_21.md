The bug in the `_get_grouper` function arises from the logic related to handling the `level` parameter for MultiIndex objects. When the condition `isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex)` is true, the function tries to extract the level values. However, due to the subsequent processing and reassignment of the `level` variable, it causes issues in the flow of the function logic.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the handling of the `level` parameter based on whether `group_axis` is a MultiIndex or not. Specifically, we should maintain consistency in how the `level` parameter is treated throughout the function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
    
    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
    
        if key is None and is_scalar(level):
            key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
            level = None
    
    # rest of the function remains the same
```

In this corrected version, we have removed the unnecessary reassignment of the `level` variable within the block related to MultiIndex handling. This change ensures that the logic regarding the `level` parameter is consistent and that the bug causing incorrect behavior is fixed.
