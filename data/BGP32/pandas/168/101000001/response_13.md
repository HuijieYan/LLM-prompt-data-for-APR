One potential error location within the buggy function `_get_grouper` is in the handling of the `level` parameter. The function tries to determine the appropriate behavior based on the data type of the `group_axis` and the value of `level` provided. If `group_axis` is a `MultiIndex`, there are specific checks and transformations applied to `level`.

The cause of the bug relates to the logic for handling `level` if it is a list-like object with a single element. The condition `if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1` is used to address this scenario. However, the subsequent code block within this conditional statement doesn't handle this case appropriately and causes issues.

To fix this bug, we can modify the code to correctly process the `level` parameter when it is a list-like object with a single element. We should extract that single element and proceed with the relevant operations based on it. Additionally, we need to ensure that the logic for handling `level` in both branches (for `MultiIndex` and non-`MultiIndex` cases) is consistent and accurate.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                if len(level) == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif len(level) == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("Multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")
            
            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError("Level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level))
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("Level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    # The remaining code of the function
    # ...
```

In this corrected version, we have adjusted the handling of the `level` parameter to correctly process a single element in a list-like object. By addressing this issue, we have improved the functionality and robustness of the `_get_grouper` function.
