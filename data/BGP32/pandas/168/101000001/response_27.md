The bug in the `_get_grouper` function arises from a logical flow issue in handling the `level` parameter for MultiIndex instances. The code implementation is repetitive and could lead to incorrect results when processing `level` values. 

To fix the bug, we should refactor the logic related to `level` handling in MultiIndex instances and simplify the branching condition. Additionally, the handling of positional arguments and named arguments should be consistent for readability and maintainability.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis, level, sort, while
    the passed-in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps

    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # validate that the passed single level is compatible with the passed
    # axis of the object
    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level):
                level = level[0]
                
            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                # Get the level values from group_axis
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None

        else:
            # allow level to be a length-one list-like object
            if is_list_like(level):
                level = level[0]

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                    )
            elif not (-1 <= level < obj.index.nlevels):
                raise ValueError("Invalid level for the object's MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    # Handle the rest of the function logic as before
```

This fix simplifies the conditional branches for handling `level` values in MultiIndex instances and ensures that the code is more robust and less error-prone.
