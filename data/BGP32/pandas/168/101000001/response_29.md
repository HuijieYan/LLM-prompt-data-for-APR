The buggy function is `_get_grouper` designed to create and return a `BaseGrouper`. The bug seems to be present in how the function handles the `level` variable and its relationship with the `group_axis` object.

In the buggy implementation, the code block regarding the validation of `level` against `group_axis` is causing issues. Especially when dealing with MultiIndex objects, the logic is not consistent. The way it processes `level` and `group_axis` might not be suitable for MultiIndex objects, leading to potential errors.

To fix the bug, we need to revisit the validation of `level` and `group_axis` for MultiIndex objects. As mentioned, the if-else blocks regarding MultiIndex checking can be optimized to ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexes.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
                
            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                # Get the level values from group_axis
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
                
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("Multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "Level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("Level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    ...

```

In this corrected version, the code block that distinguishes the behavior based on the type of `group_axis` has been revised for better consistency and correctness. This should address the bug related to incorrect handling of `level` and `group_axis` for MultiIndex objects.
