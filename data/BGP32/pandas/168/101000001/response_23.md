The bug in the `_get_grouper` function lies in the `is_in_axis` function where the `get_loc` method is being used. If the key is a tuple, then `get_loc` will always raise an exception. We need to handle this case to fix the bug.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # The code snippets, imports, and documentation remain the same as in the original function

    def is_in_axis(key):
        if not _is_label_like(key):
            if isinstance(key, tuple):
                # Handle tuple keys
                return all(obj._data.items.get_loc(k) != -1 for k in key)
            else:
                try:
                    obj._data.items.get_loc(key)
                except Exception:
                    return False

        return True

    # The rest of the function remains unchanged

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In the corrected version, I added a specific check for tuple keys in the `is_in_axis` function before attempting to call `get_loc` on the items. This modification resolves the bug related to handling tuple keys in the original implementation.
