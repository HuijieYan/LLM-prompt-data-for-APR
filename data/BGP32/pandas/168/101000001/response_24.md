The bug in the provided `_get_grouper` function lies in the condition `if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):` where it checks if the grouping axis is a `MultiIndex`. The code path inside this condition does not handle the situation correctly for MultiIndex objects, leading to potential issues. Specifically, there is a block of code inside this condition that should be modified for handling MultiIndex objects appropriately.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the code logic within the `if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):` block to correctly handle the cases involving MultiIndex objects. We need to ensure that operations such as getting level values, checking types, and index names are relevant and valid for MultiIndex objects.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps

    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # validate that the passed single level is compatible with the passed
    # axis of the object
    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            # Handle MultiIndex cases correctly
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                # Get the level values from group_axis
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None

        else:
            # Handle non-MultiIndex cases
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    # The rest of the function remains unchanged

```

In this corrected version, the `if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):` block has been updated to handle MultiIndex objects appropriately. By making these modifications, we ensure that the function operates correctly for both MultiIndex and non-MultiIndex cases, avoiding potential bugs related to MultiIndex processing.
