The buggy function `_get_grouper` has an issue that arises from the way it handles the `if level is not None` condition. The main problem is that there is redundancy in the conditional checks for MultiIndex and non-MultiIndex cases, leading to possible logic errors and missing checks.

Here is a strategy to fix the bug:
1. Simplify the if-else logic to remove redundant checks.
2. Ensure that the logic handles both MultiIndex and non-MultiIndex cases correctly.
3. Check if the `level` passed is valid and adapt the code accordingly.

Based on the analysis, here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(obj, key=None, axis=0, level=None, sort=True, observed=False, mutated=False, validate=True):
    """
    Create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating multiple groupers.

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers.

    Groupers enable local references to axis, level, sort, while the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed values.

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps.

    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        # Handle the MultiIndex case and non-MultiIndex case separately
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                # Get the level values from group_axis
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            # Ensure that 'level' is a single value
            if is_list_like(level):
                if len(level) != 1:
                    raise ValueError("Only one level is allowed for non-MultiIndex")
                level = level[0]

            # Validate level with obj index name
            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError("level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level))
            elif not -1 <= level < obj.index.nlevels:
                raise ValueError("Invalid level value for Non-MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # No changes in the subsequent code block
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This corrected version simplifies the handling of `level` for both MultiIndex and non-MultiIndex cases, ensuring correct behavior and reducing redundancy in checks.
