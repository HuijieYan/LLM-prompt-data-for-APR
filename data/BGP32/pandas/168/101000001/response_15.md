The bug in the `_get_grouper` function is due to the redundancy of processing MultiIndex instances in both the if and else blocks, leading to unnecessary complexity and potentially wrong results.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In the condition where `level` is not None, there are redundant checks and adjustments that seem to be intended for non-MultiIndex cases, but they are present in both the if and else blocks.
2. The unnecessary checks and manipulations in the MultiIndex block make the code more complex and potentially lead to incorrect behaviors for MultiIndex scenarios.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. To fix the bug, we should streamline and refactor the code within the `level is not None` condition.
2. Differentiate the handling of MultiIndex and other cases to avoid redundancy and improve clarity.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            level, key = (
                (level[0], None) if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1
                else (None, group_axis.get_level_values(level))
            )
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("Multiple levels are only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(f"Level name '{level}' is not the name of the index")
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("Level > 0 or level < -1 are only valid with MultiIndex")

    # The rest of the function remains unchanged

```

This corrected version streamlines the handling of `level` and `key` for MultiIndex and non-MultiIndex cases separately, eliminating redundancy and improving clarity.
