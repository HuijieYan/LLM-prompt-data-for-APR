The bug in the `_get_grouper` function is caused by the incorrect use of the `obj._get_axis` method when trying to determine the axis. The function assumes that the `obj` has an `_get_axis` method, but it does not verify this condition before calling it. This assumption could lead to an AttributeError if the method is not available on the `obj`.

To fix this bug, we should add a check to ensure that the `obj` has an `_get_axis` method before calling it. We can also provide a default behavior if the method is not available. 
The fixed version of the `_get_grouper` function is provided below:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis, level, sort, while
    the passed-in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps

    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis) if hasattr(obj, '_get_axis') else None

    if group_axis is None:
        raise ValueError("Object has no attribute '_get_axis'")

    # validate that the passed single level is compatible with the passed
    # axis of the object
    if level is not None:
        # Rest of the code remains the same
    else:
        raise ValueError("No level passed")

```

This fix ensures that we check if the `obj` has the `_get_axis` attribute before attempting to use it. It also raises an appropriate error if the attribute is not present, guiding the user to check the input data. Additionally, it also extracts the comments and relevant code for readability.
