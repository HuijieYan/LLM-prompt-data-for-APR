#### Analysis:
The bug occurs when trying to group by columns using the `groupby` method with `axis=1` and passing a single column name as a string or a list containing a column name. The bug leads to a `KeyError` being raised even though the specified column(s) exist in the `DataFrame`.

#### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by an issue in the `_get_grouper` function. In the part of the function where it checks if the provided key is in the index, it only checks for this in the case of a single level. When a list of keys is provided, the function does not handle this case correctly, leading to the `KeyError`.

#### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the code to handle the case where a list of keys is provided when grouping by columns.
2. Ensure that the function correctly processes the list of keys and properly identifies if they are in the columns of the DataFrame.

#### Bug Fix:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
            
            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None

        else:
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
            elif is_list_like(level):
                # Process multiple levels
                if isinstance(obj, DataFrame):
                    all_in_columns_index = all(
                        g in obj.columns or g in obj.index.names for g in level
                    )
                elif isinstance(obj, Series):
                    all_in_columns_index = all(g in obj.index.names for g in level)

                if not all_in_columns_index:
                    levels = [level]
                else:
                    # Ensure all levels are in columns index
                    levels = [None] * len(level)
            else:
                # Single level
                if isinstance(level, str):
                    if obj.index.name != level:
                        raise ValueError(
                            "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                        )
                elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                    raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

                level = None
                key = group_axis

    # Rest of the function remains the same

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

By modifying the code as shown above, the function will be able to correctly handle the case where a list of keys is provided when grouping by columns. This should resolve the `KeyError` that was occurring during the problematic test cases.
