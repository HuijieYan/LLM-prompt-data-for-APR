### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `_get_grouper()` function when trying to deal with grouping by columns using column names. The bug arises due to the function not handling column names properly in the context of grouping by columns. This results in a `KeyError` when attempting to group by column names.

### Bug Location:
The issue is located in the section of the code where it processes the keys for grouping, specifically when handling keys that represent columns. The function fails to correctly interpret column names when passed as keys for grouping.

### Bug Cause:
The root cause of the bug is the incorrect handling and interpretation of column names when passed as keys for grouping. This leads to a KeyError as the function is unable to process column names as expected.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to enhance the logic related to handling column names when used as keys for grouping. We should update the code to correctly recognize and process column names during the grouping operation to prevent the KeyError.

### Corrected Function:
Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper()` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
    
    if isinstance(key, str):
        key = [key]

    if key is not None:
        if len(key) != len(group_axis):
            raise ValueError("Length of keys must match length of axis")
    
    keys = [group_axis.get_loc(k) for k in key]

    groupings = []

    for i, key in zip(keys, key):
        ping = Grouping(
            group_axis,
            obj=group_axis,
            name=key,
            level=None,
            sort=sort,
            observed=observed,
            in_axis=True
        )
        groupings.append(ping)

    if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
    elif len(groupings) == 0:
        groupings.append(Grouping(Index([], dtype="int"), np.array([], dtype=np.intp)))

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, [], obj
```

This corrected version appropriately handles column names when they are provided as keys for grouping, avoiding the KeyError that occurred previously. The function should now work correctly for grouping by columns with column names.
