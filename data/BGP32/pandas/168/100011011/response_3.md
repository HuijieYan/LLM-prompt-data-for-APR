### Bug Fix Analysis:
The bug occurs when trying to group by columns using the column name 'x'. The function `_get_grouper` fails when dealing with the key values. The key 'x' is not correctly processed, leading to a `KeyError` being raised.

### Bug Cause:
The issue arises due to a discrepancy in handling the key value 'x' when grouping by columns. The function fails to interpret the 'x' key correctly for column grouping.

### Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the scenario when grouping is performed by column names. Specifically, the processing of the key value 'x' needs to be adjusted to allow for successful column-wise grouping.

### Bug Fix - Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ...existing code...

    if axis == 1 and key in obj.columns:
        keys = [key]
    elif axis == 0 and key in obj.index:
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = [key]

    match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # ...existing code...
```

By checking if the key is present in the respective index or columns based on the axis value, we can accurately determine the key for grouping and avoid raising a `KeyError`.

This fix ensures that the function properly handles the key value 'x' for column-wise grouping, resolving the `KeyError` issue reported in the GitHub bug.
