### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when trying to group by columns in a DataFrame using the `groupby()` method with `axis=1` and passing the column name(s) as the key. The issue arises due to how the function `_get_grouper()` handles the key parameter for grouping.

### Bug Location
The bug likely originates in the section where the function checks the type of the key and how it determines the grouping based on the key type. Specifically, the issue might lie in how the function handles the key when it is a single value, causing a KeyError.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function expects the key to be a list of column names for this case, but when the key is passed as a single string representing a column name, it raises a KeyError as it does not find the key corresponding to that single value.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when a single column name is passed as the key for grouping by columns (axis=1), it is treated as a list containing that column name. This adjustment will align the behavior with the expected functionality of grouping by columns' names.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper()` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
    
    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")
    
            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        f"level name {level} is not the name of the index."
                    )
            elif level != 0 and level != -1:
                raise ValueError("level should be 0 or -1 with MultiIndex")
    
            level = None
            key = group_axis
    
    if isinstance(key, str):
        key = [key]  # Handle single column name as a list of column names
    
    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj
    
    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj
    
    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

This corrected version should resolve the KeyError issue when trying to group by a single column name when passing the key as a string.
