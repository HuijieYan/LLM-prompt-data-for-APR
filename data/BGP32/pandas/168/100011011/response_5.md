### Bug Explanation
The issue arises when trying to group by columns using the `groupby` function with `axis=1` and passing a single column name as a list. The bug occurs because the `_get_grouper` function does not handle this case correctly and raises a KeyError when building the groupers.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the handling of single column names passed as a list when grouping by columns. We should ensure that the function can properly interpret the list of keys for column grouping in this specific scenario.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    Fixed version of the _get_grouper function.
    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # handle single column name passed as a list when grouping by columns
    if isinstance(key, list) and len(key) == 1:
        key = key[0]

    ...

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By making this modification in the function, we ensure that the single column name passed as a list is correctly processed when grouping by columns, resolving the KeyError issue.
