Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test, the issue lies in how the `key` parameter is handled when it is passed as a string representing the column name. The function is wrongly treating the column name passed in `key` as a hashable key, leading to a `KeyError` when trying to access the column for grouping.

To fix this bug, we need to properly handle the case where `key` is a string representing a column name. We should extract the values from the specified column and use them for grouping.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(key, str):  # Handle the case where key is a column name
            key = obj[key]

    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj

    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj

    is_tuple = isinstance(key, tuple)
    all_hashable = is_tuple and is_hashable(key)

    if is_tuple:
        if (all_hashable and key not in obj and set(key).issubset(obj)) or not all_hashable:
            msg = (
                "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than "
                "a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In "
                "the future, a tuple will always mean a single key."
            )
            warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
            key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # Rest of the function remains the same

```

With this correction, the function should now properly handle the case where the `key` parameter is passed as a string representing a column name. This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug where grouping by column name was leading to a `KeyError`.
