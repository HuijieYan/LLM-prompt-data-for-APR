## Bug Explanation

The buggy function `_get_grouper` fails to correctly handle the case where the `key` parameter is provided as a string instead of a list of strings. This issue occurs when grouping by columns using the `groupby` function with `axis=1`.

The bug is triggered by the combination of passing a single column name (string) as the `key` and setting `axis=1` to group along columns. The function incorrectly processes the `key`, leading to a KeyError when trying to handle the single column name.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug in the `_get_grouper` function, the key handling for grouping by columns needs to be corrected. Instead of directly expecting a single key as a string, the function should handle this case by converting the single key to a list of keys. This adjustment will ensure that the function properly interprets the key as a list even if only a single key (column name) is passed.

Furthermore, the condition that checks whether the `key` is a tuple and warns for future behavior also needs to be updated to handle the case where the key is a string. This enhancement will improve the function's flexibility and prevent errors when grouping by columns.

## Corrected Function Code

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None

        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level and not obj.columns.contains(level):
                    raise ValueError(f"level name '{level}' is not the name of the index or a column")
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj

    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        key = [key]

    keys = key
    match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    any_callable = any(callable(g) or isinstance(g, dict) for g in keys)
    any_groupers = any(isinstance(g, Grouper) for g in keys)
    any_arraylike = any(isinstance(g, (list, tuple, Series, Index, np.ndarray)) for g in keys)

    if not any_callable and not any_arraylike and not any_groupers and match_axis_length and level is None:
        if isinstance(obj, DataFrame):
            all_in_columns_index = all(g in obj.columns for g in keys)
        elif isinstance(obj, Series):
            all_in_columns_index = all(g in obj.index.names for g in keys)

        if not all_in_columns_index:
            keys = [com.asarray_tuplesafe(keys)]

    if isinstance(level, (tuple, list)):
        if key is None:
            keys = [None] * len(level)
        levels = level
    else:
        levels = [level] * len(keys)

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for i, (gpr, level) in enumerate(zip(keys, levels):
        # Remaining code remains the same
```

After applying the corrections to the `_get_grouper` function as shown above, the function should now correctly handle cases where a single key (column name as a string) is passed when grouping by columns. This adjustment ensures the function's compatibility with the intended use case outlined in the GitHub issue.
