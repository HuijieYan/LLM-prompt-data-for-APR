## Bug Explanation

The bug occurs in the `_get_grouper` function when the `level` parameter is set to a single string key ('x') but the function expects it to be a list-like object. This inconsistency causes the function to raise a `KeyError` since it tries to interpret the single string key as if it were a list of keys.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the way the function handles the `level` parameter when it is a single string key. Instead of directly checking if `level` is a list-like object, we need to first convert it into a list-like object even if it is a single string. This will ensure consistency in how the function processes the `level` parameter.

## The corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Existing code...

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(level, str):
            level = [level]  # Convert single string key to list-like object

        # Existing code...

    # Existing code...

```

By converting a single string key to a list-like object, we ensure that the function continues to process the `level` parameter consistently throughout the function. This fix should address the issue raised in the GitHub report and resolve the `KeyError` that was occurring.
