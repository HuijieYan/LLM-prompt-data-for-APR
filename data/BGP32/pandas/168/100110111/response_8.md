Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test cases, the bug occurs when the `key` parameter is passed as a list containing column names while performing a groupby operation along columns (`axis=1`). The function does not handle this scenario correctly, leading to a `KeyError` when trying to group by the specified column name.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic in the `_get_grouper` function to properly handle the case when `key` is a list of column names. We should iterate over each element in the `key` list and create a separate `Grouping` object for each column name.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if key is not None and isinstance(key, list):
        groupings = []
        exclusions = []

        for k in key:
            ping = Grouping(
                group_axis,
                k,
                obj=obj,
                name=k,
                level=level,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                in_axis=True,
            )

            groupings.append(ping)
            exclusions.append(k)

        if len(groupings) == 0:
            raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
    else:
        # Existing logic for single key handling
        # ...

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This correction will ensure that when a list of column names is provided as the `key` parameter, each column will be properly grouped individually along the columns during a groupby operation. The function will return the correct groupings for the specified column names.

By fixing this bug, the corrected function should pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output specified in the GitHub issue.
