## Bug Fix Strategy:

The bug seems to be related to the handling of the `key` parameter when it is passed as a list in the `_get_grouper` function. This leads to a `KeyError` exception being raised incorrectly. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles the case when `key` is a list of column names to group by.

Here is a summary of the changes needed:
1. Modify the logic to handle a list of keys properly.
2. Adjust the logic for checking the groupings based on the type of `key`.

## Bug Fix:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex) and not isinstance(key, (list, tuple)):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, (Grouper, list)):
        keys = key
    else:
        keys = [key]

    # Rest of the function remains as is

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

With this modification, the function will correctly handle a list of keys when grouping by columns. This change should resolve the `KeyError` exception and address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
