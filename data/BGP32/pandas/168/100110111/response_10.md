Based on the analysis of the provided buggy function, here are the identified issues and a strategy for fixing the bug:

### Issues:
1. The function fails when `key` is passed as a list of strings. The current handling assumes a single string key.
2. The logic for processing `key` values is designed to handle a single key, leading to errors when multiple keys are provided in a list.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the `if/else` logic within the function to handle both single string keys and lists of keys.
2. Modify the handling of `key` to correctly process multiple keys when passed as a list.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Existing function code
    
    # Handle multiple keys when key is a list
    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
    else:
        keys = [key]

    match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # Update the handling of keys
    if not any_callable and not any_arraylike and not any_groupers and match_axis_length and level is None:
        if isinstance(obj, DataFrame):
            all_in_columns_index = all(g in obj.columns or g in obj.index.names for g in keys)
        elif isinstance(obj, Series):
            all_in_columns_index = all(g in obj.index.names for g in keys)

        if not all_in_columns_index:
            keys = [com.asarray_tuplesafe(keys)]

    if isinstance(level, (tuple, list)):
        if key is None:
            keys = [None] * len(level)
        levels = level
    else:
        levels = [level] * len(keys)

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for i, (gpr, level) in enumerate(zip(keys, levels):
        # Existing function code

    # Existing function code
```

By implementing the provided fixes, the corrected function should now be able to handle both single string keys and lists of keys properly, ensuring the correct grouping when `key` is passed as a list. This updated version should address the issues and pass the failing test case.
