## Bug Analysis

### Error Description
The bug occurs in the `_get_grouper` function when the `key` parameter is a list containing the column name `'x'`. This leads to a `KeyError` when the function tries to process the groupers.

### Root Cause
The root cause of the bug lies in how the function processes a list of keys in the presence of multi-index data. The function incorrectly processes the `key` list, leading to the KeyError.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles a list of keys when grouping by columns, especially when dealing with multi-index data. Adjustments need to be made to the key processing logic to correctly handle the provided list of keys.

## Bug Fix

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    ...

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    if not match_axis_length:
        keys = [key]

    ...

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

By adding a check to handle the case where `key` is already a list, we ensure that the function processes the list of keys correctly, preventing the `KeyError` from occurring. This modification ensures that the function correctly groups the DataFrame by the specified column names when provided as a list.
