## Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_get_grouper` function of the `grouper.py` file in the `pandas/core/groupby` directory. This function is used internally to create a `BaseGrouper` object for grouping data based on certain parameters. The bug causes a `KeyError` to be raised when trying to group along the columns specified by name in the input `key`.

The failing test case `test_groupby_axis_1` is related to grouping a DataFrame along the columns (`axis=1`) using a column name specified as a string. The `group_name` parameter is passed as `['x']`, which represents the column name to group by.

The expected behavior is to successfully group the DataFrame along the specified columns and sum the values correctly.

The output from the failing test indicates that a `KeyError` occurs when attempting to group by the specified column name 'x'.

The GitHub issue points out the unexpected behavior when using `groupby(by="x", axis=1)` to group along columns by name.

## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_grouper` function arises due to the processing logic related to the `key` parameter when trying to group along the columns. The function fails to handle the case where the `key` is a string representing a column name correctly, resulting in a `KeyError`.

The issue stems from the code path that checks for the type of `key` and how it handles different types of inputs for grouping the data.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly interprets a column name provided as a string in the `key` parameter and allows grouping along the specified columns.

The function needs to check if the `key` parameter is a string, representing a column name, and then perform the grouping operation based on that.

We should also ensure that the groupings are correctly created and that there are no issues with the exclusions during the grouping process.

## Bug-fixed Function
Here is the corrected `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(key, str):
        if key not in obj.columns:
            raise ValueError(f"Column name '{key}' is not in the columns of the DataFrame")

    if key is None:
        keys = obj.columns.tolist()
    elif isinstance(key, str):
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = key

    # Create groupings
    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for i, key in enumerate(keys):
        gpr = key

        if gpr in obj:
            if validate:
                obj._check_label_or_level_ambiguity(gpr)
            in_axis, name, gpr = True, gpr, obj[gpr]
            exclusions.append(name)
        else:
            raise KeyError(gpr)

        ping = Grouping(
            group_axis,
            gpr,
            obj=obj,
            name=name,
            level=level,
            sort=sort,
            observed=observed,
            in_axis=in_axis,
        )

        groupings.append(ping)

    if len(groupings) == 0:
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This corrected version ensures that the function correctly handles the case when a string representing a column name is provided for grouping along the columns. Additionally, it adheres to the expected behavior of grouping by column names specified in the `key` parameter.

Make sure to test this corrected function with the failing test case to confirm that the bug has been fixed.
