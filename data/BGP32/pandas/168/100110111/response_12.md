After carefully analyzing the buggy function and the failing test, it appears that the issue lies in how the function handles the key parameter when it is a list in cases where it should be a single key. The function fails to correctly identify the key when it is a list, leading to a KeyError.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that when the key parameter is a list, it is processed correctly to match the expected behavior of groupby with columns. We should consider iterating over each key in the list and process them individually to create the correct Grouping objects.

Here is the corrected version of the function resolving the issue:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
    
    if level is not None:
        # Validate and process level condition
    
    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj

    if isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, tuple)) and all(is_hashable(item) for item in key):
        warned = False
        for k in key:
            if k not in obj and k not in obj.index:
                if not warned:
                    warnings.warn(
                        "Interpreting a list of keys as a single key. Use a single key instead.",
                        FutureWarning,
                        stacklevel=5
                    )
                    warned = True
                processed_key = [k]
            else:
                processed_key = k
            
            groupings.append(
                Grouping(
                    group_axis,
                    processed_key,
                    obj=obj,
                    observed=observed,
                    in_axis=(k in obj.columns) if axis else (k in obj.index.names),
                    name=k
                )
            )
            exclusions.append(k)
    
    if not groupings:
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
    
    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This corrected version should handle the case when the key is a list correctly, processing each key individually and creating Grouping objects accordingly. This change should address the KeyError issue reported in the GitHub ticket.
