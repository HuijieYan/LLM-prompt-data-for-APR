## Bug Fix

After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test case, it seems that the issue lies in the handling of the `key` parameter in the `_get_grouper` function. The function is expecting a single key, but in the failing test cases, a list of keys is being passed. This discrepancy causes the function to raise a KeyError.

### Bug Cause
The issue arises because the function assumes a single key instead of handling a list of keys when grouping along columns.

### Fix Strategy
To address the bug, we should modify the logic in the function to handle a list of keys appropriately when grouping along columns.

### Code Fix

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Existing code unchanged
    
    # allow level to be a length-one list-like object
    if is_list_like(level):
        level = level[0]  # Extract the single level
    
    if is_list_like(key):  # Handle a list of keys
        keys = key
    else:
        keys = [key]  # Convert single key to a list for consistency
    
    match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # Existing code unchanged
    
    if isinstance(level, (tuple, list)):
        if key is None:
            keys = [None] * len(level)
        levels = level
    else:
        levels = [level] * len(keys)

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    # Existing code unchanged
```

By making these modifications to handle a list of keys in the `key` parameter correctly, the `_get_grouper` function should now be able to group along columns as expected without raising a KeyError when a list of keys is provided.

This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub problem description as well.
