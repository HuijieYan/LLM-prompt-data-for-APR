### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs when the `key` parameter is a list containing a single string, instead of just a string. This leads to an issue in processing the keys, specifically when checking if the key exists in the object. The check for `is_in_axis` and `raise KeyError` inside the loop fails because the key is wrapped in a list, causing a `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to check if the `key` is a list and extract the key from the list when necessary. We should also ensure that the `key` variable is treated consistently as either a single key (string) or a list of keys.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # code omitted for brevity

    if isinstance(key, list):
        key = key[0] # Extract key from list

    # a passed-in Grouper, directly convert
    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj

    # code omitted for brevity
```

By adding a check to extract the key when `key` is a list, we ensure that the key is correctly processed and prevents the `KeyError` from occurring. This correction should now allow the function to handle both single keys and lists of keys correctly.
