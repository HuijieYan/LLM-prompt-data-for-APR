### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs when the `key` parameter is passed as a list of strings, resulting in an incorrect handling of the key variable within the function. The function is designed to process a single key, but it encounters issues when the key is provided as a list.

### Bug Explanation
- The function expects a single key for grouping, but if `key` is passed as a list of strings (e.g., `['x']`), it initializes `keys` as a list `[key]` initially and proceeds to treat each element in `keys` as an individual key during processing.
- During the processing, when the function encounters the key in `keys`, it tries to apply operations that expect a single key element, leading to a KeyError.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles a list of keys correctly. We should modify the logic to handle different types of keys appropriately, including single values and lists. By checking if the key is a list, we can adjust the processing accordingly.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        f"level name {level!r} is not the name of the index"
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    if isinstance(key, (list, tuple)):
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)
    else:
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False

    # the rest of the function remains the same

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

By checking if the `key` parameter is a list or tuple and adjusting the processing accordingly, the corrected function should now handle both single keys and lists of keys correctly, resolving the KeyError issue.
