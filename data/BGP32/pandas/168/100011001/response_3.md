### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs when the `key` parameter is passed as either a string (`'x'`) or a list containing a single string `['x']` while grouping a DataFrame along `axis=1`. The bug triggers a `KeyError` while processing the `key` value passed to `_get_grouper` function.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The code initially checks if the `key` is a single level name and then manipulates it based on whether the grouping is done on a `MultiIndex` or a regular index.
2. When a single string or a list containing a single string is passed as the `key`, it follows a path that identifies it as a potential column name to group by.
3. The code then tries to extract the values from the DataFrame based on this `key` (`gpr in obj`), and if not found, it raises a `KeyError` as it expects the key to be in the DataFrame columns or index names.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug:
1. Check the type of `key` and directly convert it into a list if it's a string or a list of strings.
2. Verify if the keys exist in the columns' names or indexes before processing the grouper.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(key, str):
        key = [key]
    elif not isinstance(key, list):
        key = [key]

    if not all(k in obj for k in key):
        raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in columns or index names")

    # remaining code stays the same
```

By making these changes, the function now properly handles both single string keys and lists of keys, avoiding the `KeyError` that was occurring before.
