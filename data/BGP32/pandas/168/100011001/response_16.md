### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs when the input `key` is a list, as seen in Cases 1 and 2. The current implementation does not handle a list input correctly, which leads to a `KeyError`.

In the buggy code:
- The initial conversion of `key` to a list is incorrect. It should consider that `key` might already be a list (as in Case 2).
- When iterating over `keys`, the implementation does not account for the case where `gpr` is a list, which leads to the `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the handling of list inputs in the `_get_grouper` function. Here's the corrected version:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Initialize group_axis
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Handle list input
    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
    else:
        keys = [key]

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for i, gpr in enumerate(keys):
        if isinstance(gpr, list):
            level = None
            key = gpr
        else:
            level = level

        # Other existing code remains unchanged

    # Return grouper and other required values
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This corrected version should now correctly handle both single-element and list input for the `key` parameter. It ensures that when `key` is a list, each element is properly processed, preventing the `KeyError` that was occurring before.
