### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the `key` parameter is passed as a list of one element containing a string (`['x']`). The function is assuming that the key should be a single element (not a list), leading to a `KeyError` when trying to handle the key.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `key` is a list and unpack it to extract the single string key. This can be done by modifying the logic where key is checked, and only if it is a list with length 1, should we extract the single key.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # all previous code remains unchanged
    
    if isinstance(key, list) and len(key) == 1:
        key = key[0]
    
    # all subsequent code remains unchanged
    
``` 

By adding this conditional statement before processing the key, we ensure that if `key` is passed as a list with a single element, we extract that element as the key to prevent the KeyError issue.
