### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when the `key` parameter is passed as a list containing a single element in the test cases. The function is not handling this specific case correctly, leading to a `KeyError` being raised during the execution of the code.

In both failing test cases, the `key` parameter is being passed as `'x'` and `['x']`, respectively. Inside the function, when processing the `key`, it fails to correctly handle the case where `key` is a list containing a single element. This results in the function trying to process the list as a single key, leading to the `KeyError` when trying to access the key in the DataFrame.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the handling of the `key` parameter in the function when it is passed as a list. We should modify the logic to extract the key correctly from the list when `key` is a list containing a single element.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Existing code remains the same until this point

    # Check if the key is a list with a single element
    if isinstance(key, list) and len(key) == 1:
        key = key[0]

    # Rest of the existing code continues as is
    ...
```

By introducing this modification to handle the special case of `key` being a list with a single element, we can ensure that the function processes the key correctly and avoids the `KeyError` issue.
