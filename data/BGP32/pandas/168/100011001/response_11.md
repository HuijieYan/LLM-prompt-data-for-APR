### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs when the `group_name` is passed as a list of strings (e.g., `['x']`) to the `df.groupby()` function. The error happens because the current implementation of the `_get_grouper` function doesn't handle a list input for the `key` parameter correctly when the `key` is a list of strings.

The bug arises from the `if is_tuple` block where a warning is issued but the `key` gets mistakenly converted to a list instead of treating each element in the list as a separate key.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic where the `key` parameter is handled when it is a list. We should treat each element in the list as a separate key rather than converting the list as a whole.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        # ...
        # Existing validation logic

    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        # ...

    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        # ...

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        # Warning for tuples
        msg = (
            "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than "
            "a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In "
            "the future, a tuple will always mean a single key."
        )
        warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
        keys = list(key)

    elif not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = key  # Ensure keys remains a list of keys

    # Rest of the function remains the same...

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

With this fix, the function will correctly handle cases where the `key` parameter is provided as a list of strings like `['x']`, ensuring that each string in the list is treated as an individual key. This modification should resolve the issue when passing group names as a list.
