The issue in the provided function is that it raises a `KeyError` when the `key` parameter is passed as a string (e.g., `'x'`) or as a list containing a string (e.g., `['x']`). The function expects the `key` to be either a Grouper object, a BaseGrouper object, or a tuple of keys.

To fix this bug and allow the function to handle string keys when passed, we can modify the function to convert string keys to a list format before processing them. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Convert string key to a list if the key is a string
    if isinstance(key, str):
        key = [key]
    
    """
    The rest of the function remains unchanged
    """
```

By converting the string key to a list format, the function will be able to handle both string keys and list keys correctly, addressing the KeyError that was raised in the failing test cases.
