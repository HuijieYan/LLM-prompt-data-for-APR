### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs when the `key` parameter is provided as a string in one test case and as a list in another test case. In both cases, the function fails to handle the key correctly and raises a `KeyError` because it tries to treat the key as a unique value instead of a list.

In the first test case, when `key='x'` is given as a string, the function processes it properly as it expects a single key.

In the second test case, when `key=['x']` is given as a list, the function erroneously treats it as a single key instead of multiple keys, leading to the `KeyError` because 'x' is considered as the key, and it fails to handle it as a list.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic that determines how to handle the provided key. When `key` is of type `list`, we should treat it as multiple keys, rather than a single key. This change will correctly process both single keys and lists of keys.

We can achieve this by updating the condition that checks for the type of `key` and modifies the processing logic accordingly.

### Correction of the Buggy Function
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers
    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")
            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError("level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level))
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")
            level = None
            key = group_axis

    # Treat key as a list of keys
    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)
    else:
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False

    # rest of the function...

```

This correction ensures that when the `key` parameter is provided as a list, it is treated as multiple keys, allowing the function to handle both single keys and lists of keys correctly.
