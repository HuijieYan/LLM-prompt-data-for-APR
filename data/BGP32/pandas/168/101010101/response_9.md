## Correction of the buggy function

In the buggy function `_get_grouper`, one of the conditions checks if the `key` is a tuple and then ensures it is converted to a list. However, this conversion is not taking place as intended, leading to a `KeyError` when trying to access an element of the tuple as if it was a single key.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that even when `key` is a tuple, it is correctly converted to a list. This will prevent the `KeyError` from occurring.

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # code for processing key as a tuple
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        key = list(key)

    # rest of the code remains unchanged
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
    
    # validate that the passed single level is compatible with the passed
    # axis of the object
    if level is not None:
        # ... remaining code
        
    # remaining code within the function
    
```

By converting the `key` tuple into a list when needed, we ensure that the subsequent processing on `key` aligns with the expected behavior, preventing the `KeyError` from arising.
