## Correction of the Bug in the Function

Based on the error message provided, it seems that the issue arises from passing `['x']` as the key when calling the `groupby` function; however, the `is_tuple` flag is set to `True`. This discrepancy might result in an unintentional handling of the key as a tuple instead of a list.

To fix this bug, I suggest modifying the value check for `is_tuple` to properly determine whether the passed key is a tuple or a list. This adjustment should ensure that the key is handled as a list when provided as `['x']`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Body of the function remains the same as the original function
    
    # Correct the determination of is_tuple flag
    is_tuple = isinstance(key, tuple)
    
    # Remaining body of the function remains the same as the original function
```

This modification should resolve the issue and ensure that the function can handle a list of keys correctly. The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values provided.
