## Bug Analysis
The bug occurs when the function `_get_grouper` is used to create a `BaseGrouper` object and `key` is provided as a list with a single element. The function does not handle this case properly, resulting in a `KeyError`.

The issue arises in the logic that processes the `key` input parameter. When `key` is passed as a list with a single element, it gets treated as a tuple which is not handled correctly. The function assumes the `key` is a tuple of multiple keys rather than a single key in a list.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic that handles `key` when it is provided as a list. In this case, we should convert the list to a single element key. This will ensure that the function processes the input correctly and does not raise a `KeyError`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex) and is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
            if key is None and is_scalar(level[0]):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level[0])
                level = None

    if isinstance(key, list) and len(key) == 1:
        key = key[0]
    
    # Remaining code stays the same

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

By making these changes, the function will correctly handle the case where `key` is provided as a list with a single element. This fix ensures that the function processes the input parameters accurately and resolves the `KeyError`.
