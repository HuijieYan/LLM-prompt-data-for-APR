The buggy function has a logical flaw that causes it to not handle the cases where `is_tuple` is `True` correctly. This leads to incorrect processing of the input parameters, resulting in unexpected outputs.

To fix this bug, we need to redefine the logic to properly handle cases where `is_tuple` is `True`. Below is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    ...
    if isinstance(level, (tuple, list)):
        if key is None:
            keys = [None] * len(level)
        else:
            keys = [key] * len(level)
        levels = level
    else:
        keys = [key]
        levels = [level]

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for i, (gpr, level) in enumerate(zip(keys, levels)):
        ...
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This corrected version addresses the issue related to handling `is_tuple` correctly. Now, when `is_tuple` is `True`, the function correctly assigns `keys` for each `level`, ensuring proper processing of the input parameters.

By implementing this fix, the `_get_grouper` function should now behave as expected and pass the failing tests provided.
