### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs when the `key` parameter is passed as a list containing a single element (`['x']`). The function is checking whether the `key` is a tuple or not, and if it is, it converts it to a list. However, there is an issue in the logic where handling a list with a single key is causing a `KeyError` for the input value `'x'` in this scenario. 

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic handling the `key` parameter when it is passed as a list with a single key. The function should treat it as a single key rather than trying to process it as a list.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(key, (list, tuple)):
        # Treat a list or tuple with a single key as a single key
        if len(key) == 1:
            key = key[0]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

By updating the logic to handle a list with a single key correctly, the function should no longer raise a `KeyError` and should work as expected for the failing test cases.
