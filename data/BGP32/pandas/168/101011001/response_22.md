### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs when the key parameter is provided as a single element string or a list containing a single string. The function is unable to handle this case correctly, resulting in a KeyError.

1. The function checks if key is a Grouper instance or a BaseGrouper instance and acts accordingly, but it does not handle the case where key is a simple string or list containing a single string.
2. When key is not a Grouper or BaseGrouper instance, the function tries to interpret key as a tuple, which leads to incorrect processing.
3. The function does not properly handle single element keys when the condition for index replacement is met, resulting in the error.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we should explicitly handle the case when the key is a single element string or a list containing a single string differently so that the function can process it correctly. We also need to adjust the logic related to interpreting the key as a tuple if it meets certain conditions.

### Updated Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Handle single element key when it is a string
    if isinstance(key, str):
        key = [key]

    # Handle single element key when it is a list containing a single string
    if isinstance(key, list) and len(key) == 1 and isinstance(key[0], str):
        key = key[0]

    # Proceed with the existing logic for other key types
    # The following code remains unchanged...

```

By handling single element keys correctly, this updated function should prevent the KeyError from occurring in the provided test cases.
