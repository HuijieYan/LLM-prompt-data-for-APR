### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when the input `key` is a list containing a string, such as `['x']`. In this case, the function tries to access the value `'x'` directly as a key, leading to a `KeyError` exception because it is looking for a column label, but it does not find it in the DataFrame columns.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `key` is a list containing a single element correctly. We should treat the element inside the list as a valid key rather than directly using the list itself.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(key, list) and len(key) == 1:
            key = key[0]  # Extract the single key if it's in a list

        # Validate for compatibility with the object's axis
        if key is not None:
            key_axis = obj.get(key, None)
            if key_axis is None:
                raise KeyError(key)

    ...

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

By handling the list containing the key appropriately, the function will now correctly interpret the single key `'x'` provided in the list and avoid the `KeyError` exception.
