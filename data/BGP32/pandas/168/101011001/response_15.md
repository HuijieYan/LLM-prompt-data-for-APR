### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the input `key` to the `_get_grouper()` function is a list containing a single string value. The function is not handling this case correctly, leading to a `KeyError` being raised when trying to process the groupings.

In the buggy code, the issue arises in the part of the function where it checks the type of `key`. When `key` is a list containing a single string (e.g., `['x']`), it should treat it as a single key. However, the function does not handle this case properly and ends up raising a `KeyError` when trying to process the key.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `key` is a list containing a single string value, it is correctly treated as a single key rather than a list of keys. We can achieve this by modifying the logic that determines the type of `key`.

### Bug-fixed Version of the Function
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Check if key is a list containing a single string, then convert it to a single key
    if isinstance(key, list) and len(key) == 1 and isinstance(key[0], str):
        key = key[0]

    # The rest of the function remains unchanged...
```

By modifying the logic to convert a list containing a single string key to a single key value, we can prevent the `KeyError` from occurring and ensure the function processes the input correctly.
