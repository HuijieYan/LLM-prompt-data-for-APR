### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the `key` parameter is a list containing a single element, such as when `group_name` is `['x']`. The code assigns `key = ['x']`, leading to a failure in the later flow where `obj[key]` is checked. Instead of treating `key` as a list of keys, the code should extract the single key 'x' when working with a list containing only one element.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the code so that when `key` is a list with a single element, we extract that element and treat it as a single key, not a list of keys.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # existing code here

    if isinstance(key, list) and len(key) == 1:  # Extract single key from list
        key = key[0]

    # rest of the code remains the same

```

This modification ensures that when `key` is a list with a single element, that element is extracted and treated as a single key, preventing the KeyError when accessing `obj[key]`. This fix will allow the code to handle both single keys and lists of keys correctly.
