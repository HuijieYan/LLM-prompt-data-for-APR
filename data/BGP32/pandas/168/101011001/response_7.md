### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the `key` parameter is passed as a list of strings instead of a single string in the `test_groupby_axis_1` test case. The function checks whether the `key` is a tuple with hashable elements before converting it to a list. If the elements are hashable and not found in the DataFrame, it will raise a KeyError as it expects a single key but receives a list.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when `key` is a list of keys in a way that does not raise a KeyError. We can modify the logic to check if the `key` is an iterable and convert it to a list of keys if necessary. 

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
from collections.abc import Iterable

def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Existing code unchanged until checking keys
    # ...
    if isinstance(key, Iterable) and not isinstance(key, str):
        keys = list(key)
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False

    # Existing code continues as before
    # ...
``` 

By making this change, the function will correctly handle both single keys and lists of keys passed to the `key` parameter. This will prevent the KeyError from being raised when a list is provided.
