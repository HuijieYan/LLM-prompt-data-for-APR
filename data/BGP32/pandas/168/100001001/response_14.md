The bug in the code seems to be related to how the `level` parameter is handled when creating the `BaseGrouper`. The issue can be identified in the section of code that deals with `levels`, specifically where `levels` is set to `[level] * len(keys)`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `levels` list is correctly constructed based on the provided `level` input. We should set `levels` to `[level] * len(keys)` only when `level` is a single value. If `level` is already a list or tuple, we can directly use it.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # code for handling different cases omitted for brevity

    if isinstance(level, (tuple, list)):
        if len(level) != len(keys):
            raise ValueError("Length of level and keys must be the same")
        levels = level
    else:
        levels = [level] * len(keys)

    # the rest of the function remains the same
```

By making this change, the `levels` list will be correctly generated based on the provided input, fixing the bug related to the handling of the `level` parameter in the `BaseGrouper` creation.
