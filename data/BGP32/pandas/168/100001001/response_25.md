### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_grouper` function arises from the incorrect handling of the `key` parameter when it is a tuple. The function wrongly interprets the tuple as a single key in some cases, leading to incorrect processing and functionality.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the case when `key` is a tuple and ensure that it is treated as a list of keys. Here's a corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        if all(is_hashable(k) for k in key):
            if key not in obj and set(key).issubset(obj):
                warnings.warn(
                    "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In the future, a tuple will always mean a single key.",
                    FutureWarning,
                    stacklevel=2,
                )
            key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    any_callable = any(callable(g) or isinstance(g, dict) for g in keys)
    any_groupers = any(isinstance(g, Grouper) for g in keys)
    any_arraylike = any(
        isinstance(g, (list, tuple, Series, Index, np.ndarray)) for g in keys
    )

    if (
        not any_callable
        and not any_arraylike
        and not any_groupers
        and match_axis_length
        and level is None
    ):
        if isinstance(obj, DataFrame):
            all_in_columns_index = all(
                g in obj.columns or g in obj.index.names for g in keys
            )
        elif isinstance(obj, Series):
            all_in_columns_index = all(g in obj.index.names for g in keys)

        if not all_in_columns_index:
            keys = [com.asarray_tuplesafe(keys)]

    if isinstance(level, (tuple, list)):
        if key is None:
            keys = [None] * len(level)
        levels = level
    else:
        levels = [level] * len(keys)

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for i, (gpr, level) in enumerate(zip(keys, levels)):
        # The rest of the function remains the same

```

This corrected version properly handles the case when `key` is a tuple, ensuring it is interpreted as a list of keys. This will resolve the issue of incorrect processing due to tuple misinterpretation.
