The bug in the function `_get_grouper` lies in the logic related to handling the `key` parameter in the provided input parameters. The function fails to correctly process the `key` when it's a string or a list of strings. This leads to incorrect behavior in constructing the `groupings` list, resulting in the subsequent runtime issues.

To fix the bug, we need to make adjustments in the section where `key` is processed. Specifically, we should update the handling of string keys and ensure that they are appropriately converted to the desired format for further processing.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # code for processing group_axis remains unchanged

    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj

    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        # Process tuple keys
        msg = (
            "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than "
            "a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In "
            "the future, a tuple will always mean a single key."
        )
        warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
        key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, list) and not isinstance(key, str):
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = key if isinstance(key, list) else [key]
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # rest of the code for processing levels, creating groupings, etc.

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

By making these adjustments, the function should now correctly handle string keys and ensure that they are processed appropriately in constructing the `groupings` list. This fix addresses the bug and should prevent the issues observed in the failing tests.
