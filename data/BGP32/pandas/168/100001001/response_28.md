### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_grouper` function arises from the case where the `key` parameter is a tuple with hashable elements, resulting in a mistaken interpretation of the keys. This leads to incorrect handling of the keys and subsequently affects the grouping process.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic related to the `key` parameter interpretation. Specifically, we should ensure that tuple keys are correctly handled as a list of keys when needed.

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Validating level for MultiIndex
    if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex) and is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
        level = level[0]
    
    if key is not None and not isinstance(key, list):
        key = [key]

    keys = key if key is not None else []
    
    # Warn if tuple key is interpreted as a list of keys
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        if all(is_hashable(k) for k in key) and set(key).issubset(obj):
            warnings.warn(
                "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In the future, a tuple will always mean a single key.",
                FutureWarning,
                stacklevel=5
            )
            keys = list(key)
    
    # Remaining code remains the same
    ...
```

By updating the handling of tuple keys and adjusting the initialization of the `keys` list, we address the bug and ensure the correct interpretation of keys for the grouping operation.
