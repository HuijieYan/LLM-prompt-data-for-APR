The bug in the `_get_grouper` function seems to be related to the processing of the `level`, `key`, and `group_axis` variables. The function is intended to handle different cases based on the input parameters, but there are issues with the conditions and assignments within those cases.

Based on the provided runtime input/output values, it seems that the issue lies in the handling of the `level` and `key` variables when they are not None. The function does not consistently handle the cases where `level` is either a single value or a list-like object correctly.

To fix the bug:
1. Ensure that the function properly handles both single values and list-like objects for the `level` variable.
2. Check if the conditions and assignments related to `level` and `key` are consistent and correctly update the variables.
3. Verify that the logic for `group_axis` and its manipulation is functioning as intended.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level):
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("Multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        f"Level name {level} is not the name of the index"
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("Level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj
    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj

    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        if key not in obj and set(key).issubset(obj):
            warnings.warn(
                "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In the future, a tuple will always mean a single key.",
                FutureWarning,
                stacklevel=5,
            )
            key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # Rest of the function implementation remains the same

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

By updating the handling of `level` and `key`, the corrected version of the function should address the bugs detected in the provided runtime values. Feel free to test this corrected version with various input scenarios to verify its correctness.
