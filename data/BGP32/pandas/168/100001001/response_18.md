Based on the provided runtime input/output values, the bug in the `_get_grouper` function seems to be related to how the key is handled when it is a list. The function does not properly consider a list of keys for grouping when `key` is a list. It treats the list as a single key instead of individual keys. To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to correctly handle the case when `key` is a list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            # handle MultiIndex case
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
        else:
            # handle non-MultiIndex case
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
        
        # rest of the code remains the same
        
    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        # rest of the code remains the same

    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        # rest of the code remains the same

    else:
        if isinstance(key, tuple):
            # handle tuple case correctly
            if any(isinstance(k, list) for k in key):
                keys = [k for sublist in key for k in sublist]
            else:
                keys = list(key)
        elif not isinstance(key, list):
            keys = [key]
            match_axis_length = False
        else:
            keys = key
            match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)
    
    # rest of the code remains the same
    
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In this corrected version, the function properly handles the case when `key` is a list by splitting the list into individual keys when necessary. This change ensures that each key is correctly processed during the grouping operation.
