### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_grouper` function occurs when handling the `key` parameter that is supposed to define the groupers for the grouping operation. The issue arises when the `key` is a tuple, as the function incorrectly interprets it as a single key instead of a list of keys. This leads to incorrect processing and potential errors later in the function.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic related to handling tuple keys. The function should correctly interpret a tuple key as a list of keys instead of a single key. We should modify the code to handle tuple keys appropriately and convert them to a list of keys.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # previous code

    # fix for handling tuple keys
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        if not all(is_hashable(k) for k in key) or (key and set(key).issubset(obj)):
            msg = (
                "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than "
                "a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In "
                "the future, a tuple will always mean a single key."
            )
            warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
            key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # remaining code
```

By making this adjustment in how tuple keys are handled, the function should now correctly process multiple keys when provided as a tuple. This fix ensures that the function behaves as intended without errors related to tuple handling.
