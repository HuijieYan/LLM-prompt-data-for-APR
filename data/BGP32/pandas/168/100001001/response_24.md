The bug in the `_get_grouper` function seems to lie in the handling of the `key` parameter when it is a list of keys. The code incorrectly assumes that all elements of the list are hashable, leading to incorrect processing of the keys.

To fix the bug, we need to address the handling of list-like keys, ensuring that the code correctly interprets them as a list of keys rather than a single key. We should also consider converting tuples to lists for consistent processing.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(obj, key=None, axis=0, level=None, sort=True, observed=False, mutated=False, validate=True):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Correctly handle list-like keys and tuples
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        key = list(key)
        msg = "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In the future, a tuple will always mean a single key."
        warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = key

    levels = [level] * len(keys)

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for i, (gpr, level) in enumerate(zip(keys, levels)):
        ...
        # Proceed with the rest of the function as before
    ...

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This revised code should now handle list-like keys and tuples correctly, ensuring that they are processed as intended.
