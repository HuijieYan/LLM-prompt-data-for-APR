### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates a `KeyError` being raised for `'x'`.
2. The `_get_grouper()` function is trying to process the `key` parameter, which is causing the issue.
3. The bug occurs because the `key` parameter is expected to be a list of keys, but the function is not handling the case where `key` is a single key string properly.
4. The issue arises when processing a single key string, 'x', which is not being converted into a list of keys.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the code to handle the case where the `key` parameter is a single key string by converting it into a list of keys.
2. Check if the supplied key is a list and handle it accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None and isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
        if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
            level = level[0]

        if key is None and is_scalar(level):
            key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
            level = None

    elif not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # Rest of the code remains the same
    # ...
    # No changes required after this point

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

By making the modifications as outlined above, the function should now correctly handle single key strings and pass the provided failing test.
