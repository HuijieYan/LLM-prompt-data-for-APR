### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_grouper` is used to create and return a `BaseGrouper` object, which maps how to create the grouper indexers. The error occurs when passing a list of group keys (`['x']`) instead of a single group key (`'x'`) to the `groupby` function. This error is due to the implementation of the `_get_grouper` function not handling list-like objects correctly.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The bug occurs because the `_get_grouper` function expects a single key but does not handle list-like keys properly.
2. When a list-like key is provided, the function is unable to process it correctly and raises a `KeyError` because it expects a single key.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the handling of list-like keys in the `_get_grouper` function by converting them to a list of keys if needed. This will allow the function to handle both single keys and list-like keys consistently.

### Updated `_get_grouper` Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(level, list) and len(level) == 1:
            level = level[0]

        if key is None and is_scalar(level):
            key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
            level = None

        else:
            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(f"Level name '{level}' is not the name of the index.")
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")
            level = None
            key = group_axis

    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
    else:
        keys = [key]

    # Rest of the function remains the same as before

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

### With this fix, the `_get_grouper` function will handle both single keys and list-like keys correctly. It will convert list-like keys to a list of keys before processing them.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
