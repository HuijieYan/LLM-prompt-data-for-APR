### Analysis:
1. The `_get_grouper` function is responsible for creating a `BaseGrouper` which is an internal mapping for creating grouper indexers.
2. The bug occurs when the `group_name` parameter is passed as a list in the `test_groupby_axis_1` test function. This triggers an issue in the `_get_grouper` function due to the mismatch in handling single keys versus list of keys.
3. The error message indicates that a `KeyError` is raised when the function encounters `'x'` as the key in the list.
4. The bug occurs due to the check for a single key not properly handling a list being passed as the key.
   
### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, we need to update how the function deals with `key` when it is a list. Instead of treating it as a single key, it needs to iterate over the elements in the list and process them individually. 

### Corrected Version of the `_get_grouper` function:
Here is the corrected implementation of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
                
            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            # handle single or multiple levels for non-MultiIndex
            if is_list_like(level):
                if len(level) == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                else:
                    raise ValueError("Multiple levels are only valid with MultiIndex")
            
            # handle string level or integer level
            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(f"Level name {level} is not the name of the index")
            elif level not in [0, -1]:
                raise ValueError("Level should be either 0 or -1 for non-MultiIndex")
            
            level = key = group_axis

    if isinstance(key, list):
        groupings = []
        exclusions = []
        for k in key:
            key_grouper, key_exclusions, obj = _get_grouper(obj, key=k, axis=axis, level=level, sort=sort, observed=observed, mutated=mutated, validate=False)
            groupings.append(key_grouper)
            exclusions.extend(key_exclusions)
        
        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, exclusions, obj

    # handle other cases as before
    # remaining code as it is
```

By iterating over each element in the list for `key` and processing them individually, we ensure correct handling of single key and list of keys scenarios. This should resolve the issue and the corrected function should now pass the failing test.
