### Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with related functions:

The `_get_grouper` function is responsible for creating and returning a `BaseGrouper`, which is an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers. This function works in conjunction with related functions `_is_label_like` and `_get_grouper` which help in identifying the key, axis, level, sort, observed, mutated, and validate parameters to construct the grouper. The function deals with different scenarios like handling single level, MultiIndex, passing a Grouper instance, handling tuple keys, and creating Groupings.

### Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function:

- The error could be related to the key being passed as a list instead of a single element, causing issues during processing.
- The handling of `key` being a tuple might not be functioning correctly, and the logic to interpret it as a list of keys could be causing problems.
- The validation checks for level and index name might not be working as expected.

### Explaining the cause of the bug:

The error occurs when a list is passed as the `key` parameter in the `groupby` function, and the function tries to process it as a single key rather than a list of keys. This discrepancy leads to a `KeyError` when the function tries to handle the given list as a single key, which is not present in the object.

### Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug:

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic related to handling the keys passed to the function. Instead of treating a list as a single key, we should iterate over the elements of the list and process each key individually. Additionally, we need to ensure that the handling of tuple keys is correctly interpreted as an actual key in the future.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_grouper` function:

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function that addresses the issues mentioned above:

```python
def _get_grouper(obj, key=None, axis=0, level=None, sort=True, observed=False, mutated=False, validate=True):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        # Handle MultiIndex scenario
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            # Handle level check for non-MultiIndex
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError("level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level))
            elif not (-1 <= level <= 0):
                raise ValueError("level must be between -1 and 0 for non-MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        # Handle Grouper instance
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        return grouper, {key.key} if key.key else [], obj
    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        # Handle BaseGrouper instance
        return key, [], obj

    # Handle tuple keys for future compatibility
    is_tuple = isinstance(key, tuple)
    if is_tuple and (is_hashable(key) or set(key).issubset(obj)):
        msg = "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than a single key."
        warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
        key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = key

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for gpr, level in zip(keys, [level] * len(keys)):
        if gpr in obj:
            exclusions.append(gpr)
        else:
            raise KeyError(gpr)

        groupings.append(Grouping(group_axis, gpr, obj=obj, name=None, level=level, sort=sort, observed=observed))

    if len(groupings) == 0:
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")

    # create the internals grouper
    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This corrected version of the function should be able to handle list keys correctly and iterates over the keys to process them individually. It also includes modifications to handle tuple keys and raise the appropriate exceptions.
