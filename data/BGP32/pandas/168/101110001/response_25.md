### Bug Analysis:
- The bug occurs when the `group_name` parameter is passed as a list `['x']` to the `df.groupby()` function.
- The buggy function `_get_grouper` is responsible for handling the grouping operation and preparing the grouper object.
- The error occurs in the section where it checks if the key exists in the object (DataFrame) or not. The key is expected to be a string, not a list.
- When `group_name` is passed as `['x']`, the check for existing key fails because 'x' is wrapped inside a list, causing a `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the logic to handle a list of keys passed as a single element instead of a sequence of keys.
- Check if the key is a list and extract the single element from it to use as the key.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_grouper` Function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Existing code remains the same until the key extraction
    if isinstance(key, list):
        if len(key) == 1:  # Extract the key from the list
            key = key[0]
        else:
            raise ValueError("Multiple keys passed! Expected a single key.")

    # Proceed with the rest of the function logic
```

By extracting the key from the list if it contains a single element, we can prevent the `KeyError` when a single key is passed as a list. This change should fix the bug observed in the failing test.
