### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_grouper` is responsible for creating and returning a BaseGrouper, which is an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
2. The error occurs when the function is called with `group_name` containing a list, causing an issue with key handling.
3. The error message indicates a `KeyError` for the input 'x', which fails when trying to process a list key.
4. The bug seems to be related to handling keys correctly, especially when dealing with list keys or single keys.
5. The error occurs due to incorrect key handling logic for lists and tuples.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Understand the way keys are handled in the `_get_grouper` function.
2. Identify the key handling logic required for single keys, tuple keys, and list keys.
3. Update the key handling logic to correctly infer the type of key provided.
4. Validate the key input to handle single keys, tuple keys, and list keys.
5. Ensure that the code can handle input keys that are both single elements and lists.

### Updated `_get_grouper` Function:
```python
# Fixed version of the _get_grouper function

def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if not isinstance(key, list):  # Handle single key input
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = key

    match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # Additional code for handling tuple keys
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        msg = (
            "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than "
            "a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In "
            "the future, a tuple will always mean a single key."
        )
        warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
        keys = list(key)

    any_arraylike = any(isinstance(g, (list, tuple, Series, Index, np.ndarray)) for g in keys)

    # Index replacement logic
    if not any_arraylike and match_axis_length and level is None:
        all_in_columns_index = all(g in obj.columns or g in obj.index.names for g in keys)
        if not all_in_columns_index:
            keys = [com.asarray_tuplesafe(keys)]

    # Continue with the rest of the code as is...
```

By updating the key handling logic and adding support for tuple keys, the bug related to handling list keys should be resolved. This fix should allow the `_get_grouper` function to correctly process different types of keys provided as input.
