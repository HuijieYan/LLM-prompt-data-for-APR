### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_grouper()` is responsible for creating a `BaseGrouper` object that represents how to create the grouper indexers for groupby operations in Pandas. However, the bug occurs when the function encounters a scenario where the `key` parameter is a single-element list (e.g., `['x']`). This triggers an error when trying to handle this case, resulting in a `KeyError`.

### Bug Location:
The bug occurs in the part of the code where the function tries to handle the `key` parameter when it is not a list. The code is not handling the scenario where `key` is a list with a single element correctly.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by an incorrect assumption in the code for how to handle the `key` parameter. Specifically, when `key` is a single-element list, the code logic does not properly handle it and results in a KeyError due to incorrect access.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `_get_grouper()` function to correctly handle the scenario where `key` is a single-element list. We need to ensure that when `key` is a list with a single element, it is processed similarly to a scalar key.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper()` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        # Handle single-element list key
        if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
            level = level[0]

    # Other existing code...

    # Handle single-element list key scenario
    if is_list_like(key) and len(key) == 1:
        key = key[0]

    # Ensure key is passed as a list for consistency
    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # Other existing code...

    if not match_axis_length:
        raise ValueError("Group keys do not match the axis length.")

    # Other existing code...

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This corrected version of the function includes a modification to correctly handle the scenario where `key` is a single-element list. It ensures that `key` is treated similarly to a scalar key in such cases.

By applying this correction, the `_get_grouper()` function should now handle the scenario with the failing test correctly and pass the tests without raising a KeyError.
