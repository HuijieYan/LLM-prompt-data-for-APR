### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_grouper` is failing due to a KeyError. The error occurs when the input `key` is a list with a single element (e.g., `['x']`) and the function incorrectly tries to access this single element directly, resulting in the KeyError.

### Bug Location:
The location of the bug can be identified in the segment where key handling is done, particularly when the input key is checked for list-like properties.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect handling of the key when it is a list with a single element. The code mistakenly treats the single element directly as the key, leading to a KeyError.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to check for list-like properties of the `key` and correctly handle the case when the `key` is a list with a single element. Specifically, we need to ensure that when handling list input, we iterate over the list elements and process them individually.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here, I have provided the corrected `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        # Handle level and key for MultiIndex case
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            # Handle level for non-MultiIndex
            ...

    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        ...

    # Handle list-like key input
    elif is_list_like(key):
        keys = key
        # Process each element of the list key individually
        groupers = []
        for k in keys:
            key_grouper, key_exclusions, obj = _get_grouper(
                obj, key=k, axis=axis, level=level, sort=sort, observed=observed, mutated=mutated, validate=False
            )
            groupers.append(key_grouper)
        
        return BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupers, sort=sort, mutated=mutated), [], obj

    # More cases and return statements as in the original function
    ...
```

With the provided corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function above, the bug should be fixed, and the function should now handle the list-like input key correctly.
