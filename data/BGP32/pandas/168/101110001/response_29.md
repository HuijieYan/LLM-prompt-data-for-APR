### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_grouper` is responsible for creating and returning a `BaseGrouper`, which is an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers. It involves multiple steps to determine the references passed in and then creates a `Grouping` for each one, combined into a `BaseGrouper`.
- The error occurs when the `group_name` being passed is a list (like `['x']`), which then fails to handle this case correctly in the current implementation.

### Bug:
The bug occurs when the `group_name` is a list, as the implementation doesn't account for this correctly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the logic when `key` is not a list to convert it into a list if it's a tuple that represents a list of keys.
- Handle the case when `group_name` is a list correctly to avoid the `KeyError` that is currently happening.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_grouper` function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
        # Handle MultiIndex case
        pass
    else:
        if isinstance(key, tuple):
            all_hashable = is_hashable(key)
            if all_hashable and set(key).issubset(obj):
                key = list(key)
                msg = "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In the future, a tuple will always mean a single key."
                warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
        
        if not isinstance(key, list):
            keys = [key]
        else:
            keys = key

        # Rest of the function logic remains unchanged
        # Implement the handling of group_name as a list correctly

    # Separate branch to handle group_name when it's a list
    if isinstance(group_name, list):
        # Handle the case when group_name is a list
        key = group_name  # This is where we pass the group_name list as key
        if not isinstance(key, list):
            keys = [key]
        else:
            keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

        # Rest of the logic for creating BaseGrouper remains the same

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

By making these adjustments, the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function should handle the case when `group_name` is a list and correctly implement the grouping logic for it.
