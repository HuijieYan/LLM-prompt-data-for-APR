### Analysis:
1. The `_get_grouper` function is used to create and return a `BaseGrouper`, which is an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers. It involves handling various cases related to keys, axis, and level.
2. The failing test `test_groupby_axis_1` calls the `df.groupby(group_name, axis=1).sum()` function, which in turn invokes the `_get_grouper` function with arguments that led to the `KeyError: 'x'` error.
3. The bug seems to be related to how the `key` parameter is processed within the `_get_grouper` function, specifically when `key` is a list. The bug occurs when `keys = key` is executed for a list `key`, causing subsequent processing of `keys` to malfunction.
4. To fix the bug, the handling of `key` being a list should be revised to ensure correct processing of the `keys` list.
5. The correct handling should involve iterating over each item in `key` (if it's a list) and processing them individually within the for loop responsible for creating `Grouping` objects.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        processed_keys = []
        for k in key:
            base_grouper, exclusions, obj = _get_grouper(obj, key=k, axis=axis, level=level, sort=sort, observed=observed, mutated=mutated, validate=False)
            processed_keys.append((base_grouper, exclusions))
        return processed_keys, [], obj

    # Remaining code implementation as before
    # ...
```

By iterating over each item in the `key` list and processing them individually within the for loop, we ensure that each key is correctly handled and processed. This should fix the bug and allow the `_get_grouper` function to handle both single keys and lists of keys correctly.
