Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test cases, it seems that the issue lies in the handling of the `key` parameter when it is a string representing a column name. The function fails to properly identify the column name and group along columns as intended.

### Bug Explanation:
- The bug occurs when attempting to group by a column name using the `key` parameter.
- In the function `_get_grouper`, the logic for processing the `key` parameter is faulty when it is a string.
- The function incorrectly interprets the string key as a MultiIndex, leading to a KeyError or other issues when trying to group along columns.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling the `key` parameter:
- When `key` is a single string, it should be correctly recognized as a column name.
- The function should identify the column name and perform grouping along columns accordingly.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        # Handle non-MultiIndex cases for single level
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
    
        # Handle level as string or integer
        if is_list_like(level):
            nlevels = len(level)
            if nlevels == 1:
                level = level[0]
            elif nlevels == 0:
                raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
            else:
                raise ValueError("Multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")
    
        if isinstance(level, str) and obj.index.name != level:
            raise ValueError("Level name is not the name of the index")
        elif not -1 <= level <= len(obj.index.levels) - 1:
            raise ValueError("Level value out of range")

        key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)

    # Handle grouping by column name
    if isinstance(key, str):
        key = obj[key]

    # Rest of the function remains the same...

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

By fixing the logic to correctly handle the column name when grouping by columns, the function should now pass the failing test cases and align with the expected input/output values as described in the GitHub issue.
