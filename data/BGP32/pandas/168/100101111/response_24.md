After analyzing the provided buggy function and the failing test cases, here is a breakdown of the bug and its root cause:

- Bug: The `_get_grouper` function fails to correctly handle grouping by columns when the `key` parameter is a single string. This leads to a KeyError during the test cases that aim to group along columns, preventing the function from correctly grouping and summing the columns as expected.
- Root Cause: The bug arises from incorrect handling of the `key` parameter when it is a single string representing a column name. The function does not properly identify the `key` as a column name and thus fails to apply the grouping operation correctly on the specified columns.

To fix this issue, we need to update the `_get_grouper` function to correctly identify and handle the single string `key` parameter representing a column name for grouping. This involves ensuring that the function properly recognizes the `key` as a column name and operates on the columns accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    Corrected function to handle grouping by columns when key is a single string.
    """
   
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        # Updated logic to handle grouping by columns when key is a single string
        if isinstance(key, str):
            if obj.columns.name != key:
                raise ValueError(
                    f"Column name '{key}' is not the name of the columns"
                )
            key = obj.columns

    # The rest of the function remains the same

    # Ensure to return the grouper, exclusions, and obj as before

```

By updating the `_get_grouper` function with the corrected logic to handle grouping by columns when the `key` parameter is a single string representing a column name, the function should now correctly handle the grouping operation according to the specified columns. This fix should address the KeyError issue and align the function's behavior with the expected output in the failing test cases.
