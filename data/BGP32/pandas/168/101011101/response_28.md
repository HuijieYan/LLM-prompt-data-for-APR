Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the provided test cases, the bug in the `_get_grouper` function seems to be related to how the `key` parameter is handled when it is a single value or a list of values. Currently, the code assumes `key` is a single value and converts it to a list of keys, leading to a `KeyError` when iterating over the keys.

To fix this bug and handle both single and multiple keys correctly, we can modify the code to always treat `key` as a list, even if it is a single value. This will ensure consistency and prevent errors when iterating over the keys.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    # Convert key to a list if not already a list
    if not isinstance(key, list):
        key = [key]

    keys = key
    match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    any_callable = any(callable(g) or isinstance(g, dict) for g in keys)
    any_groupers = any(isinstance(g, Grouper) for g in keys)
    any_arraylike = any(
        isinstance(g, (list, tuple, Series, Index, np.ndarray)) for g in keys
    )

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

By making the adjustment to always treat `key` as a list, we eliminate the KeyErrors caused by iterating over a single key and ensure that the function processes both single and multiple keys accurately. This modification should pass the failing test cases and handle the input parameters as expected.
