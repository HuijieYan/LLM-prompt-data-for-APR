## Solution:

The issue in the `_get_grouper` function is due to the use of the `is_hashable` function, which determines whether a variable is hashable. However, it is incorrectly handling cases where a tuple is passed as the key variable.

To fix this bug, you should avoid using the `is_hashable` function for tuples because tuples are usually hashable. Instead, directly handle the logic for tuples without relying on the `is_hashable` function.

Here is the fixed version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # function body remains the same, only the tuple key handling is adjusted
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        if any(k not in obj for k in key):
            key = list(key)
            warnings.warn(
                "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than a single key. "
                "Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In the future, a tuple will always mean a single key.",
                FutureWarning,
                stacklevel=5,
            )

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)
    # remaining code is unchanged

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

By directly handling the tuple key in the function, we avoid the issue caused by the `is_hashable` function. This fixed version should now correctly handle tuple keys and pass the failing tests.
