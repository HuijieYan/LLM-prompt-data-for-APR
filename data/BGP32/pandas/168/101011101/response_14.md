Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug occurs due to the key being passed as a list instead of a single value. The function is not handling this case properly, leading to a KeyError when trying to access the DataFrame using a list as the key.

To fix this issue, we can modify the condition where we check if the key is a list. We should handle both the single value and list cases appropriately. Below is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function that should address the bug:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Body of the function remains the same except for handling 'key'
    
    # Handle key as a single value or list
    if isinstance(key, list):
        if len(key) == 1:
            key = key[0]
        else:
            raise ValueError("multiple keys passed, only single key supported")
    
    # continue with the rest of the function as before
```

This modification ensures that the key is appropriately handled whether it is a single value or a list. Now, the `_get_grouper` function should work correctly even when a list is passed as the key.

Please integrate this fix into your code and retest it with the failing test cases to confirm that the bug has been resolved. Let me know if you need further assistance.
