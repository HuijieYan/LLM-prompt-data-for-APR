Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the provided test cases, it appears that the issue arises from the comparison of the key variable within the function. The key is expected to be a list, but the function raises a KeyError when it is provided as a string instead of a list.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the key is always treated as a list, even if it contains a single element. We can achieve this by converting the key to a list if it is not already a list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            # Handle level as a list-like object with a single element
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None

        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("Multiple levels are only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "Level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("Level > 0 or Level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj

    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj

    is_tuple = isinstance(key, tuple)
    all_hashable = is_tuple and is_hashable(key)

    if is_tuple:
        if all_hashable and key not in obj and set(key).issubset(obj) or not all_hashable:
            msg = (
                "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than "
                "a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In "
                "the future, a tuple will always mean a single key."
            )
            warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
            key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = key

    match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # Remaining code remains unchanged

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This corrected version ensures that the key is converted to a list if it is not already a list. This modification should resolve the KeyError that was occurring due to the incorrect type of key being passed to the function.
