Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test cases, the bug arises when the function tries to process a key that is a list, specifically in the following line:
```python
if not isinstance(key, list):
```

This condition is not considering the case where the key is provided as a list. To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition to handle list keys properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        # Process non-MultiIndex objects
        if not isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            ...
        else:
            ...
            key = group_axis
    
    # Handle list keys
    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
    else:
        keys = [key]
    
    match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # Rest of the code remains the same ...

```

This modification ensures that when `key` is provided as a list, it is correctly assigned to `keys` variable for further processing. This should resolve the issue when the key is a list and allow the function to handle this case properly.

After applying this correction, the function should work correctly with list keys, as indicated by the failing test cases.
