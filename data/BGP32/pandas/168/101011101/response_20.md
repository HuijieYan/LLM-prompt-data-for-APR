Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the provided runtime input/output values, the bug in the `_get_grouper` function seems to be related to how the `key` parameter is processed. The function expects a single key but is incorrectly interpreting a single-item list as a key, leading to a `KeyError`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles both single keys and lists of keys correctly. We should modify the logic to handle the case where `key` is a list by extracting the key from the list and assigning it to the `key` variable before proceeding with the rest of the function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
            
            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("Multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(f"Level name '{level}' is not the name of the index")
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("Level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    if isinstance(key, list):
        key = key[0]

    # Rest of the function remains the same

```

This corrected version should handle the case where `key` is passed as a list, extract the key correctly, and prevent the `KeyError` that occurred in the failing tests.
