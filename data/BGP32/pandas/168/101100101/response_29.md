### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_get_grouper` function is due to the logic inside the condition where it checks the type of `level`. The bug causes an incorrect check and assignment of `level`, which results in incorrect grouping. Specifically, the issue lies in the following code block:
```python
elif isinstance(level, str):
    if obj.index.name != level:
        raise ValueError(
            "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
        )
elif level > 0 or level < -1:
    raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")
```
The issue arises when `level` is a single `int`, but since the `isinstance(level, str)` condition is checked before, the subsequent condition for ints which should have been part of the `else` block is being skipped. This results in incorrect handling of `level`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to reorganize the conditions in the code block to ensure correct handling of `level` values. Specifically, we should first check if `level` is a string type, then check if it's an integer. If it's neither, handle it accordingly to avoid the issue.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Existing code
    
    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if is_scalar(level):
                if isinstance(level, (str, int)):  # Add a check for int
                    if isinstance(level, str):
                        if obj.index.name != level:
                            raise ValueError(
                                "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                            )
                    elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                        raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

                level = None
                key = group_axis

    # Existing code
```

By restructuring the condition checks as mentioned above, we ensure that `level` is correctly handled based on its type, resolving the bug in the function.
