### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_grouper` has an issue in how it handles the `level` parameter, especially when dealing with MultiIndex objects. The function checks the type of `group_axis` and performs different operations based on whether it's a MultiIndex or not. However, the flow for handling `level` and `key` is duplicated in both the if-block and else-block for MultiIndex objects. This duplication might lead to incorrect handling of the parameters.

### Bug:
- The `level` and `key` processing logic in the if-block and else-block for MultiIndex objects might not differentiate properly between the cases where `level` is a scalar or a list-like object.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Unify the logic for handling `level` and `key` in both the if-block and else-block for MultiIndex objects.
2. Ensure that the processing for single or multiple levels is consistent and correctly handles the situation where `level` is a list-like object.

### Updated Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function considering the identified bug:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        # Consolidating treatment for MultiIndex and Single Index
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(obj.index.name, str) and not obj.index.name == level:
                raise ValueError(
                    "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                )
            elif not isinstance(level, str) and (level > 0 or level < -1):
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis
```

By consolidating the processing for MultiIndex and Single Index objects, we ensure that the function deals with `level` and `key` consistently and correctly handles the cases where `level` is either a scalar or a list-like object. This update should address the bug identified in the original function.
