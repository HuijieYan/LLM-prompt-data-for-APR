The bug lies in the `_get_grouper` function where the condition for checking the length of the level is incorrect. The bug is evident in the cases provided as the function leads to erroneous outputs.

The bug causes the function to fail to correctly interpret a length-one list-like object for the level and raise unnecessary ValueError exceptions. This incorrect behavior results in the failing test cases due to wrong assumptions made during groupings.

To fix this bug, we need to update the part of the code where the length of the level is checked and correctly handle the cases where it is a length-one list-like object to avoid unnecessary exceptions.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Function body remains the same

    # allow level to be a length-one list-like object
    if is_list_like(level):
        nlevels = len(level)
        if nlevels == 1:
            level = level[0]
        elif nlevels == 0:
            raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
        else:
            raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

    # Rest of the function body remains the same

```

After applying this correction, the `_get_grouper` function will now correctly handle a length-one list-like object for the level parameter and avoid raising unnecessary exceptions, leading to a successful execution of the failing test cases.
