The bug in the `_get_grouper` function is that the `is_hashable` function is being called with an argument that contains `None`, which causes an error. This happens when the `key` variable is a list containing a `None` value, and the `is_tuple` and `all_hashable` checks fail. To fix this issue, we need to enhance error handling in that part of the code.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Original function code...

    # Add the following code snippet before the is_tuple check
    if key is not None and len(key) > 0 and any(k is None for k in key):
        raise ValueError("Key list cannot contain 'None' values")

    is_tuple = isinstance(key, tuple)

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

By adding the check for `None` values in the `key` list before the `is_tuple` check, we can prevent the error from occurring. This modification ensures that the `key` list does not contain any `None` values, which aligns with the expected behavior.

After applying this fix, the `_get_grouper` function should be able to handle all cases correctly based on the provided test cases.
