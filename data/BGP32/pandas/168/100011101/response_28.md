## Bug Analysis
The bug arises from the function `_get_grouper` when the input `key` is a list containing a single string element `'x'`. The function, however, is not handling this case correctly, leading to a `KeyError` being raised.

1. The function extracts `key` from the input parameters and uses it to determine the grouping. In the failing cases, `key` is a list with a single string element `'x'`.
2. The function then processes the `keys` variable in different conditional blocks that are meant to handle various scenarios for grouping, such as when `key` is a list-like object. It fails to correctly interpret the `key` list containing a single string element.
3. The bugs arise in the section handling `keys`, `any_callable`, `any_arraylike`, and `match_axis_length` variables. The function does not properly handle a list as the `key`, leading to unexpected behavior.
4. The final error occurs at line 615 when trying to use the incorrect approach to handle the grouping, leading to a `KeyError`.

## Bug Fixing Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the code to correctly handle cases when `key` is a list containing a single string element. This will involve updating the logic around the `keys`, `any_callable`, `any_arraylike`, and `match_axis_length` variables.

## Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the function `_get_grouper`:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
    
    if isinstance(key, list) and len(key) == 1:  # Correctly handle a list with a single key
        key = key[0]
    
    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj
    
    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj
    
    is_tuple = isinstance(key, tuple)
    all_hashable = is_tuple and is_hashable(key)
    
    if is_tuple:
        if (all_hashable and key not in obj and set(key).issubset(obj)) or not all_hashable:
            msg = "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than a single key."
            warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
            key = list(key)
    
    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [com.asarray_tuplesafe(key)]  # Convert single key to list form
        match_axis_length = True  # Set to True to correctly handle the key as a list
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)
    
    # Rest of the function remains the same...
``` 

By making the adjustment to appropriately handle a list with a single key element, the function will now correctly process the grouping, avoiding the `KeyError` that was occurring.
