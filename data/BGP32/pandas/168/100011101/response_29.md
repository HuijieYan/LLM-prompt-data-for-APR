## Bug in the Buggy Function:
The buggy function is failing for cases where the key parameter is a single element list, such as `['x']`, causing a `KeyError` to be raised. This issue occurs when the keys are checked if they are present in the obj, but since the key in these cases is a list, it is not directly found as a key in the object columns or index names, leading to the KeyError.

## Solution Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the key is a list appropriately. We should modify the code to extract the key from the list before using it for further processing. By ensuring the correct handling of the key when it is passed as a single element list, we can address this issue.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Extract the key if a single-element list
    if isinstance(key, list) and len(key) == 1:
        key = key[0]

    # Proceed with the existing logic

    # rest of the function remains the same
```
