### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs when the `is_in_axis` function fails to correctly identify whether a key is present in the index or not. In the failing test cases, the key 'x' is not found in the index, causing a `KeyError` to be raised during execution.

The issue arises because the `is_in_axis` function does not handle the case where the key is not hashable correctly. It should check if the key exists in the index before proceeding. Additionally, the condition for identifying unhashable elements as a list of keys is not working as intended.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `is_in_axis` function to properly handle the case where the key does not exist in the index. We should also adjust the condition for handling unhashable elements correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:
```python
def is_in_axis(group_axis, key):
    if not _is_label_like(key):
        if group_axis.get_loc(key, None) == -1:
            return False
    return True

def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Existing code remains unchanged

    for i, (gpr, level) in enumerate(zip(keys, levels)):
        if is_in_obj(gpr):  # df.groupby(df['name'])
            in_axis, name = True, gpr.name
            exclusions.append(name)
        elif is_in_axis(group_axis, gpr):  # df.groupby('name')
            if gpr in obj:
                # existing code remains unchanged
            # existing code remains unchanged

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

By making these adjustments, the function should be able to handle non-existent keys correctly, preventing the `KeyError` from being raised.
