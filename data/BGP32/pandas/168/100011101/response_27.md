## Bug Analysis
1. The function `_get_grouper` is designed to create and return a BaseGrouper object, which defines how to create the grouper indexers based on the input parameters.
2. The bug occurs when passing a single string key or a list with a single element as the `key`. It raises a `KeyError` when processing the key in such scenarios.
3. The error arises from the section where the key is evaluated. The condition blocks inside the loop for `for i, (gpr, level) in enumerate(zip(keys, levels))` do not handle single keys properly.
4. In the failing test cases, the key parameter is either a single string or a list with a single element. The function should handle these cases correctly without raising a `KeyError`.
5. To fix the bug, the function needs to check if the key is a single string or a list with a single element and adjust the logic accordingly.

## Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function to handle the cases of a single key provided as either a string or a list with a single element:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Existing code
    
    if isinstance(key, str):
        key = [key]  # Wrap single key in a list
    
    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)
        
    # Existing code
```

By adding this check at the beginning of the function, we ensure that when a single key is provided as a string or a list with a single element, it will be treated correctly as a list of keys for further processing. This modification should resolve the `KeyError` issue encountered in the failing tests.
