## Bug Analysis
The bug in the `_get_grouper` function appears to be caused by an `is_in_axis` check in the for loop where it raises a KeyError if the key is not found in the passed DataFrame. This results in the test failing due to the KeyError being raised when using a key that doesn't exist.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the key is not found in the object by updating the logic inside the `is_in_axis` function. We should modify the function to properly handle the scenario where the key is not present in the object and avoid raising a KeyError.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # existing code as is ...

    # if the actual grouper should be obj[key]
    def is_in_axis(key):
        if not _is_label_like(key):
            try:
                obj_columns = obj.columns if axis == 1 else obj.index
                if key in obj_columns:
                    return True
                else:
                    return False
            except Exception:
                return False

        return True

    # existing code as is ...
}
```

By modifying the `is_in_axis` function to check if the key is in the appropriate columns or index based on the passed axis, we can prevent the KeyError from being raised when the key is not found.

After applying this fix, the `_get_grouper` function should handle cases where the key is not present in the DataFrame correctly, resolving the failing test cases.
