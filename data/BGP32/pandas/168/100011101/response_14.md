## Bug Explanation:
In the buggy function `_get_grouper`, the issue arises when handling the `key` parameter. When the `key` is a string, it is directly used as a single key value. However, when `key` is passed as a list with a single element, the function incorrectly tries to unpack it without checking if it is an iterable.

This behavior causes confusion in the subsequent logic where keys are extracted, leading to wrong assumptions about the data structure and failing validations for the key passed as `['x']`.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic within the function `_get_grouper` to correctly handle the `key` parameter when it is passed as a list. We should ensure that a single element list is treated as a single key. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(obj, key=None, axis=0, level=None, sort=True, observed=False, mutated=False, validate=True):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
    
    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None

        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    if isinstance(key, list) and len(key) == 1:
        key = key[0]

    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj

    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj

    # code for tuple handling...

    # rest of the function remains the same
```

Making this modification to specifically handle the case when the `key` is passed as a list with a single element will prevent the issue encountered and ensure correct processing of the key, resolving the failing tests.
