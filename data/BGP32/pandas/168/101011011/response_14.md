### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs when trying to perform grouping by passing the column name(s) along the axis, resulting in a `KeyError`. The issue seems to stem from how the function `_get_grouper` handles the key for grouping when it is a list containing column name(s).

The bug is due to the `key` variable being expected to be a single value, not a list of keys. This causes the function to raise a `KeyError` when trying to treat the list of keys as a single key.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling the `key` variable to correctly process a list of keys. By iterating over each key in the list and creating separate groupings for each key, we can ensure that the grouping operation is performed correctly.

### Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Handle the special case of a list of keys
    if isinstance(key, list):
        groupings = []
        exclusions = []

        for k in key:
            if isinstance(k, str) and k in obj.columns:
                ping = Grouping(
                    group_axis,
                    obj[k],
                    obj=obj,
                    name=k,
                    level=level,
                    sort=sort,
                    observed=observed,
                    in_axis=True,
                )
                groupings.append(ping)
                exclusions.append(k)
            else:
                raise KeyError(k)
        
        # Create the internals grouper
        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, exclusions, obj

    # Rest of the original function remains unchanged

```

This corrected function now properly handles the case when `key` is a list of column names, creating individual groupings for each column in the list. This fix should resolve the `KeyError` issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
