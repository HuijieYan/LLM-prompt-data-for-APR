### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_get_grouper` function when the `key` parameter is a list containing column names to group by, such as `['x']`. In this case, the function incorrectly raises a `KeyError` when trying to access a column with the name provided in the `key`.

The issue arises due to the function attempting to check if the element in `key` is in the object internally, resulting in the `KeyError` when trying to access a column name as if it were an index. This behavior is incorrect and leads to the failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the code where the function handles the case when `key` is a list of column names. Instead of trying to access an element as an index, we need to directly consider the elements as column labels and proceed with the grouping operation accordingly.

### Updated `_get_grouper` Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        # Checking if level is specified and handling it appropriately
        # Code for handling the level parameter...

    # Handling the case when key is a list of column names
    if isinstance(key, list):  # Check for a list of keys
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

        # Mapping named columns directly without checking against obj
        obj._data.items.get_loc(keys)  # Directly mapping column names

        keys = [com.asarray_tuplesafe(keys)]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged...

    # code after handling key as a list
```

By directly mapping the column names provided in the list `key` to the DataFrame's columns, we avoid the `KeyError` raised due to incorrect internal processing. This modification should address the issue reported in the failing tests and the corresponding GitHub issue.
