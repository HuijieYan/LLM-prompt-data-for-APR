### Bug Analysis:
The issue arises when trying to perform a groupby operation along columns using column names as the grouping key. The bug causes a KeyError when passing a single column name key as a string ('x') or as a list of one string ['x']. The buggy function fails to handle single column names correctly due to incorrect processing of the key parameter.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In the provided runtime scenarios, the key parameter is passed as a single column name ('x' or ['x']), but the function incorrectly processes it, leading to a KeyError.
2. The bug occurs in the section where the key parameter is processed to determine the appropriate grouping and settings for the groupby operation.
3. The function fails to correctly interpret a single column name as the key for grouping along columns.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when a single column name is passed as the key for grouping along columns, it is correctly interpreted and processed without raising a KeyError. This involves adjusting the logic for handling single column names as the grouping key.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Single column name handling
    if isinstance(key, str):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Grouper):   # Existing Grouper processing remains the same
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj

    # Remaining key processing logic remains the same

    # return statement remains as-is
```

The corrected function includes a check to handle single column names correctly when passed as the key parameter for grouping along columns. This adjustment should resolve the KeyError issue when grouping by a single column.
