Based on the provided information, the bug seems to be related to how the function `_get_grouper` handles the 'key' input parameter when it is a string or a list of strings representing column names for grouping. The bug leads to a KeyError being raised when attempting to group by column names.

The key issue seems to be in the processing logic for the 'key' parameter when it represents column names. The function is not correctly handling the case when 'key' is a string or a list of strings to be used as column names for grouping.

To fix the bug, the logic for processing the 'key' parameter needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the case where it represents column names. Specifically, the function needs to ensure that the provided 'key' is used to select columns for grouping, rather than raising a KeyError.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Validate the key parameter
    if key is not None:
        # Check if key is a string or list of strings
        if isinstance(key, str):
            columns = [key]
        elif isinstance(key, list):
            columns = key
        else:
            columns = []

        # Update groupings with columns if they are present in the DataFrame
        for col in columns:
            if col in obj.columns:
                groupings.append(Grouping(group_axis, obj[col], obj=obj, name=col, level=level, sort=sort, observed=observed, in_axis=True))
                exclusions.append(col)

    # Check if any groupings were added
    if len(groupings) == 0:
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")

    # Create the internals grouper
    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This corrected version directly identifies the columns specified in the 'key' parameter and adds them to the groupings based on their presence in the DataFrame's columns.

This fix should address the KeyError issue when trying to group by column names. It aligns with the expected behavior for grouping by columns as described in the GitHub issue.
