## Bug Explanation

The bug occurs when a DataFrame is grouped using the `groupby` method with the `axis=1` parameter to group along the columns. In the provided buggy function `_get_grouper`, the key passed to define the grouping along the columns is not correctly handled, leading to a `KeyError`. The issue is related to how the key is processed when grouping along the columns.

1. The function receives the DataFrame, the key ('x' or ['x']), axis value, and other parameters.
2. It tries to handle the key passed for grouping along the columns.
3. There is a check for whether the key is in the index, and this check is causing failures because it wrongly expects the key to exist in the DataFrame's index when it is meant to be a column name.

The bug leads to a `KeyError` because the code assumes the key should be in the index, leading to an incorrect check.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the key is processed for grouping along the columns in the `_get_grouper` function. We should ensure that the key is correctly checked against the column names, rather than against the index labels.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        raise ValueError("groupby does not currently support grouping by level on columns")

    # Ensure key is treated as a list of keys when needed
    if not isinstance(key, list):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, list) and all(col in obj.columns for col in key):
        keys = [obj.columns.get_loc(col) for col in key]
    else:
        raise KeyError("One or more keys are not valid column names")

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for i, gpr in enumerate(keys):
        ping = Grouping(
            group_axis,
            gpr,
            obj=obj,
            name=None,
            level=None,
            sort=sort,
            observed=observed,
            in_axis=True,
        )

        groupings.append(ping)

    if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This corrected version ensures that the key provided for grouping along the columns is checked against the DataFrame's column names, fixing the `KeyError` issue that was occurring before. This fix aligns the key processing logic with the behavior expected for grouping along the columns.
