Based on the provided information, the issue seems to be related to the incorrect handling of grouping by column name(s) when using GroupBy with axis=1. The bug causes a KeyError when trying to group by column name(s) despite the intent being to group based on column labels.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_get_grouper` function of the Pandas library. It fails to correctly handle the case where the user wants to group by column name(s) (such as 'x'). This results in a KeyError, as the function fails to interpret the input correctly, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly interprets the input when grouping by column name(s). Specifically, the function should handle the case where the user wants to group by columns explicitly.

### Bug Fix and Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
            level = level[0]

        if key is None and is_scalar(level):
            key = level
            level = None

    if key is None:
        keys = [group_axis.name]
    elif isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
    else:
        keys = [key]

    levels = [level] * len(keys)

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for i, (gpr, level) in enumerate(zip(keys, levels)):
        exclusions.append(gpr)  # Add the key to exclusions

        ping = Grouping(
            group_axis,
            gpr,
            obj=obj,
            name=gpr,
            level=level,
            sort=sort,
            observed=observed,
            in_axis=True,
        )

        groupings.append(ping)

    if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
    elif len(groupings) == 0:
        groupings.append(Grouping(Index([], dtype="int"), np.array([], dtype=np.intp)))

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

### Changes Made
1. Updated the handling of level and key inputs to ensure correct interpretation.
2. Modified the logic to correctly handle grouping by column name(s).
3. Set the default key to the column name if not provided.

By applying these changes, the corrected function should now handle grouping by column name(s) as expected, resolving the KeyError issue during GroupBy with axis=1 on column names like 'x'.

This corrected version should address the problem reported in the GitHub issue related to grouping by column name(s).
