### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs when trying to group by columns using `df.groupby(by="x", axis=1)`, but it raises a `KeyError` for the column name `'x'`. The problematic code lies within the `_get_grouper` function in the `pandas/core/groupby/grouper.py` file. Specifically, the issue arises due to the handling of the `key` parameter when it is a string representing a column name. The function fails to properly treat the column name as a valid key for grouping.

### Bug Cause
1. The function `_get_grouper` initially tries to validate the `level` parameter, but it only considers the case where `level` is specified as an integer and does not handle the scenario where it could be a string representing a column name.
2. During the processing of keys, the function fails to recognize a string key as a valid column name and raises a `KeyError` for the column name `'x'` when trying to group by columns.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Modify the code to correctly handle the case where a string key represents a column name.
2. Ensure that the function can properly group by columns using column names provided as keys.

### Code Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    ...
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        if key in obj.columns:
            key = obj[key]  # Converts the column name to the actual column data
        
    # a passed-in Grouper, directly convert
    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj

    ...
```

This fix includes checking if the `key` is a string representing a column name. If so, it converts the column name to the actual column data before proceeding with the grouping operation. This modification ensures that column names can be used as keys for grouping by columns.

By implementing this correction, the function should now correctly handle grouping by columns with column names as keys, resolving the `KeyError` issue.
