### Correction of the Bug in the Function

After analyzing the bug and understanding the problem, it seems that the issue lies in the `_get_grouper` function where the input key is not being handled correctly when it is a list. The function is assuming the key is a single value instead of a list of keys when `key` is provided as a list. This leads to the `KeyError` exception being raised.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the handling of the `key` parameter to correctly process it as a list of keys when needed. Below is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
from pandas.core.groupby.grouper import Grouping, Grouper

def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Previous code here...
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, tuple)):
        if len(key) > 1:
            msg = (
                "Interpreting list 'by' as multiple keys, consider providing a single key"
            )
            warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
        
        keys = key
    
    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
    
    match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)
    
    # Rest of the function...
```

In this correction, we first check if the `key` parameter is a list or tuple. If it is, we handle it as a list of keys. If it contains more than one element, a warning is issued. The handling of `key` is then modified accordingly to ensure proper processing.

After making this correction, the function should now be able to handle both single keys and lists of keys correctly, avoiding the `KeyError` exception raised in the failing test cases.
