### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because when a column name is passed as `key` in the `groupby` function with `axis=1`, the function interprets it as if it should be part of the index. This leads to a `KeyError` since the column name does not exist in the index. The function should correctly handle column names passed as `key` for grouping along columns.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic in the `_get_grouper` function to correctly handle the case where a column name is passed as `key` and grouping is being done along columns (`axis=1`).
2. Correctly differentiate between indexing along the index and columns when processing the `key` parameter.
3. Ensure that the function recognizes the passed `key` as referring to columns when `axis=1`.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_grouper` function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
            level = level[0]

        if key is None and is_scalar(level):
            key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
            level = None

    if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
        if is_list_like(key) and len(key) == 1:
            key = key[0]
        if key is not None and key in group_axis.names:
            key = None

    if key is not None and isinstance(key, str) and key in obj.columns:
        key = obj[key]

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    if not any(callable(g) or isinstance(g, dict) for g in keys):
        if not any(isinstance(g, Grouper) for g in keys):
            if all(isinstance(g, str) and g in obj.columns for g in keys):
                keys = [obj[g] for g in keys]

    # Remaining code stays the same...

```

Applying this corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function should fix the bug and allow the `groupby` function to correctly handle grouping along columns specified by column names.
