## Bug Analysis:
- The bug occurs in the `_get_grouper()` function when trying to group by columns (`axis=1`) based on the provided `key` which is supposed to be a column name or a list of column names.
- The error message `KeyError: 'x'` indicates that the function is trying to access or use a key (`'x'`) that does not match any column in the DataFrame.
- The function is failing to correctly interpret the column name provided as the key for grouping along columns.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
- Update the logic in the `_get_grouper()` function to correctly handle the case when grouping along columns (`axis=1`) and provide column names as the key.
- Ensure that the function properly identifies and uses the column names for grouping along columns.
- Make sure the function can handle both single column names and lists of column names for grouping.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if axis == 1 and key is not None and not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
    elif axis == 1 and key is not None and isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
    else:
        keys = None

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for i, gpr in enumerate(keys):
        if gpr in obj.columns:
            name = gpr
        else:
            raise KeyError(gpr)

        # Create the Grouping
        ping = Grouping(
            group_axis,
            gpr,
            obj=obj,
            name=name,
            level=level,
            sort=sort,
            observed=observed,
            in_axis=True,
        )

        groupings.append(ping)
    
    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

After applying this fix, the `_get_grouper()` function should be able to correctly group by column names when `axis=1` is specified and avoid the `KeyError` when using column names for grouping along columns.
