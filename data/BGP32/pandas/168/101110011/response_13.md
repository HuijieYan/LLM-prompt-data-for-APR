The bug in the `_get_grouper` function arises when trying to group along columns in a DataFrame by passing the column name(s) as the key. The function currently fails to correctly handle this scenario, leading to a `KeyError`.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. The bug occurs in the `_get_grouper` function due to incorrect handling of the key when grouping along columns using `groupby(by="x", axis=1).sum()`.
2. The function does not recognize the key as a column name(s), leading to the `KeyError`.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the key processing logic to correctly handle column names for grouping along columns.
2. Add a condition to distinguish column names from other key types.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_grouper` Function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Check if key is a column name(s) and convert to the corresponding column(s)
    if isinstance(key, str):
        key = obj[key]

    # rest of the function remains the same
```

By adding the above condition, the function will correctly handle column names when grouping along columns and prevent the `KeyError` from occurring.

This corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function should resolve the issue described in the GitHub bug report and pass the failing test case.
