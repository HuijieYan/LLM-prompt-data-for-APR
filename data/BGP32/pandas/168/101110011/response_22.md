### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_grouper` in `pandas/core/groupby/grouper.py` is responsible for creating a `BaseGrouper` object for grouping operations based on specified parameters.
2. The failing test `test_groupby_axis_1` in `pandas/tests/groupby/test_groupby.py` verifies the grouping operation along an axis with specified column names.
3. The error message indicates a `KeyError` at line 615, indicating a failure related to handling column names during groupby operation.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the unexpected error when grouping by column names.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when trying to group by column names using the `groupby` function with a list of column names. The function fails to recognize the input as column names and raises a `KeyError`. This leads to incorrect grouping behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug, we need to adjust the validation and handling of column names in the `_get_grouper` function. Specifically, we should ensure that the input keys are treated as column names per the user's intention.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_grouper(obj, key=None, axis=0, level=None, sort=True, observed=False, mutated=False, validate=True):
    # Existing code
    
    if not isinstance(key, list):
        key = [key]  # Ensure key is a list for easier processing

    # Add a check to ensure key is interpreted as column names
    if isinstance(key[0], str):
        key = key[0]  # If first element in list is a string, consider as single column name

    # Continue with the existing logic for grouping
    
    # Return the grouper object along with exclusions and object
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

By modifying the handling of the `key` parameter within the `_get_grouper` function, specifically checking if the key is a list of strings and converting it to a single string column name, we can address the issue and ensure correct grouping by column names.

This correction should resolve the KeyError issue when grouping by column names, as reported in the GitHub issue.
