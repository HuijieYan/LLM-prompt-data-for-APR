### Bug Explanation:
The issue arises when the `key` parameter is passed as a list of strings, which triggers an error in the buggy function. The function is not handling the case where `key` is a list containing the column names to group by correctly, resulting in a `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix:
To resolve this issue, we need to modify the code to handle the case where `key` is a list of keys representing the columns to group by. We should iterate over each key in the list and process them individually.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
    
    keys = key if isinstance(key, list) else [key]
    
    levels = level if isinstance(level, list) else [level] * len(keys)
    
    groupings = []
    exclusions = []
    
    for key, level in zip(keys, levels):
    
        if key in obj:
            name = key
            in_axis, level = True, None
            exclusions.append(name)
        else:
            raise KeyError(key)
    
        if is_categorical_dtype(obj[key]) and len(obj[key]) != obj.shape[axis]:
            raise ValueError(f"Length of grouper and axis must be same length")
    
        ping = Grouping(
            group_axis,
            obj[key],
            obj=obj,
            name=name,
            level=level,
            sort=sort,
            observed=observed,
            in_axis=in_axis
        )
    
        groupings.append(ping)
    
    if len(obj):
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
    
    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

By iterating over the keys and levels in the corrected version, we can handle the case where `key` is a list of keys containing column names. This ensures that the function processes each key correctly and avoids the `KeyError` that occurred previously.
