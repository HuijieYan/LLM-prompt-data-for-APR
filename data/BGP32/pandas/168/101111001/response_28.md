### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the key parameter passed to the `_get_grouper` function is expected to be either a single key or a list of keys but not a nested list as in the failing test case where `key = ['x']`.

The key handling logic in the function assumes a certain structure for the key parameter, leading to the KeyError when `key = ['x']`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key parameter is correctly processed as a list of keys even if it is provided as a nested list with one element. We can modify the code to convert the key to a list of keys if it is not already in the list format.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None

        # rest of the existing logic remains the same

    # Convert key to a list if it's not already in list format
    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = key

    # rest of the existing logic remains the same

    # return statement remains the same
```

By making this change, the function will handle the key parameter correctly even if it is provided in a nested list format, and the bug causing the KeyError in the failing test will be resolved.
