### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the key `['x']` is being treated as a tuple key instead of a list of keys. This results in the `key` not being found in the `obj` index, causing a `KeyError` to be raised.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the case where `key` is a list. The logic to handle tuple keys should be modified to ensure that a list of keys such as `['x']` is properly processed.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        # Remove unnecessary MultiIndex checks

        if is_list_like(level):
            nlevels = len(level)
            if nlevels == 1:
                level = level[0]
            elif nlevels == 0:
                raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
            else:
                raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        f"level name {level} is not the name of the index"
                    )
            elif level != 0:
                raise ValueError("level must be 0 for non-MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    # Handle the case where key is a list directly
    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj

    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        if set(key).issubset(obj):
            key = list(key)
            msg = (
                "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than "
                "a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In "
                "the future, a tuple will always mean a single key."
            )
            warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=3)

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        # Ensure key is treated as a list
        key = [key]

    keys = key
    match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    any_callable = any(callable(g) or isinstance(g, dict) for g in keys)
    any_groupers = any(isinstance(g, Grouper) for g in keys)
    any_arraylike = any(
        isinstance(g, (list, tuple, Series, Index, np.ndar) for g in keys)
    )

    # continue with the rest of the function...
```

After applying this fix, the function should correctly handle the case where the `key` is a list of keys, such as `['x']`, and no `KeyError` should be raised.
