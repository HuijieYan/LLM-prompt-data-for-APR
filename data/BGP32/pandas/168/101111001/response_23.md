### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function `_get_grouper` expects the `key` parameter to be a single key, not a list of keys. When a list is passed as the `key`, the function does not properly handle it, resulting in a `KeyError` when trying to access the key `'x'`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle cases where the `key` is a list by iterating over each key in the list. This way, we can process each key individually and avoid the `KeyError` that occurs due to incorrect handling of a list of keys.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        groupers = []
        exclusions = []
        for k in key:
            grouper, excl, obj = _get_grouper(
                obj, key=k, axis=axis, level=level, sort=sort, observed=observed, mutated=mutated, validate=False
            )
            groupers.append(grouper)
            exclusions.extend(excl)
        return BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupers, sort=sort, mutated=mutated), exclusions, obj
    
    # For the case when key is not a list
    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

This fix ensures that when `key` is a list, each key is processed individually, creating a separate `Grouping` object for each key. This approach avoids the `KeyError` and correctly handles the grouping by multiple keys.
