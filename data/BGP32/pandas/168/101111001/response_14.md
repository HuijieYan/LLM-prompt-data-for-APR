### Bug Explanation
In the provided function `_get_grouper`, the bug lies in the logic that handles the `keys` parameter. The issue arises when `key` is a list (in Case 2), where the function incorrectly deduces that `match_axis_length` is `False` due to the condition `len(keys) == len(group_axis)`. This condition seems to be intended to check if the length of the `keys` list matches the length of the `group_axis`, but it is failing to do so in this scenario.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the condition to check for `match_axis_length` correctly compares the lengths of `keys` and `group_axis`. Additionally, we need to handle the case where `key` is a list appropriately.

### Updated Corrected Function
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        # Logic for handling level

    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        # Logic for handling Grouper

    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj

    is_tuple = isinstance(key, tuple)
    all_hashable = is_tuple and all(is_hashable(k) for k in key)

    if is_tuple:
        if (all_hashable and any(k not in obj and set([k]).issubset(obj) for k in key)) or not all_hashable:
            msg = (
                "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than "
                "a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In "
                "the future, a tuple will always mean a single key."
            )
            warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
            key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    if isinstance(level, (tuple, list)):
        if key is None:
            keys = [None] * len(level)
        levels = level
    else:
        levels = [level] * len(keys)

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

By correcting the logic related to `keys` and ensuring that it correctly matches the length of `keys` with the length of `group_axis`, we can address the bug in the `_get_grouper` function.
