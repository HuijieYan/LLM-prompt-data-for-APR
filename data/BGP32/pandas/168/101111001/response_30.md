### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs when the function `_get_grouper` is expecting a single key as input but receives a list of keys. This situation leads to a `KeyError` being raised as it cannot process a list of keys. The faulty logic lies in handling the input key when it's not a single key as expected.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic to handle both single keys and lists of keys appropriately.
2. Modify the conditionals to differentiate between single keys and multiple keys (lists).
3. Adjust the processing steps based on the type of key received.

### Updated Function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None

        else:
            if isinstance(level, list):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("Multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "Level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("Level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    if isinstance(key, (Grouper, BaseGrouper)):
        return key, [], obj

    # Convert tuple keys to list keys
    if isinstance(key, tuple) and (not is_hashable(key) or key not in obj):
        msg = "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys. Use 'by=[...]' instead."
        warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
        key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = key

    match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    any_callable = any(callable(g) or isinstance(g, dict) for g in keys)
    any_groupers = any(isinstance(g, Grouper) for g in keys)
    any_arraylike = any(
        isinstance(g, (list, tuple, Series, Index, np.ndarray)) for g in keys
    )

    if not any_callable and not any_arraylike and not any_groupers and match_axis_length and level is None:
        all_in_columns_index = all(
            g in obj.columns or g in obj.index.names for g in keys
        )
        if not all_in_columns_index:
            keys = [com.asarray_tuplesafe(keys)]

    if isinstance(level, (tuple, list)):
        levels = level
    else:
        levels = [level] * len(keys)

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for i, (gpr, level) in enumerate(zip(keys, levels):
        # Existing logic continued here

    # Existing logic continued here

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

### The updated function includes handling both single keys and lists of keys appropriately, reducing the chances of encountering a `KeyError` in scenarios where lists of keys are provided.
