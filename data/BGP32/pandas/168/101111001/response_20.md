### Bug in the Buggy Function
The bug in the `_get_grouper` function arises from the handling of the `key` parameter. When `key` is a list containing a single element, as in Case 2, the function incorrectly treats it as a tuple in certain conditional blocks, leading to a `KeyError` being raised. This incorrect handling of the `key` parameter results in the function failing with the specific test cases provided.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic related to how the function handles the `key` parameter when it is a list containing a single element. By differentiating between a single element key and a tuple key in the relevant conditional blocks, we can ensure that the function processes them correctly. Additionally, we need to handle the case when `key` is a list to avoid treating it as a tuple.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
By modifying the logic for handling `key` as a list of keys and ensuring it is treated correctly as such, we can provide a corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... existing code ...

    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
    else:
        keys = [key]

    match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # ... existing code ...
```

By making the above correction in the `_get_grouper` function, with specific attention to handling `key` as a list of keys, we should be able to resolve the `KeyError` issue observed in the failing test cases provided.
