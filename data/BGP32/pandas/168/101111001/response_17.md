### Bug Explanation
In the buggy `_get_grouper` function, the issue arises when the `key` parameter is passed as a list containing a single element `'x'`. The function attempts to iterate over `keys` where `keys` is assigned as `[key]`. However, during the subsequent processing, it checks if `is_tuple` is True, which causes a problem, as `key` is now a list.

Moreover, the condition `not isinstance(key, list)` is evaluated as False because `key` is a list. This leads to incorrect processing of the `keys` list. Finally, the function attempts to handle the case as if `key` was a tuple instead of a list, leading to a KeyError when trying to access the column name `'x'`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the code handles the case where `key` is a list correctly, instead of treating it as a tuple. We can modify the code to iterate over `keys` only if `key` is not a list. Additionally, we need to adjust the logic related to `is_tuple` to correctly handle the case where `key` is a list.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_grouper` Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function based on the analysis:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None

        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj

    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    any_callable = any(callable(g) or isinstance(g, dict) for g in keys)
    any_groupers = any(isinstance(g, Grouper) for g in keys)
    any_arraylike = any(
        isinstance(g, (list, tuple, Series, Index, np.ndarray)) for g in keys
    )

    if not any_callable and not any_arraylike and not any_groupers and match_axis_length and level is None:
        if isinstance(obj, DataFrame):
            all_in_columns_index = all(g in obj.columns or g in obj.index.names for g in keys)
        elif isinstance(obj, Series):
            all_in_columns_index = all(g in obj.index.names for g in keys)

        if not all_in_columns_index:
            keys = [com.asarray_tuplesafe(keys)]

    levels = [level] * len(keys)
    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for i, (gpr, level) in enumerate(zip(keys, levels):
        # Remaining code unchanged
```

Applying this fix should correct the issue and allow the failing tests to pass successfully. Let me know if you need any more help!
