### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs due to a key error raised when processing the input keys during the initialization of the `BaseGrouper` in the `_get_grouper` function. The key error is raised when checking if the key is present in the object.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The keys variable is set to `['x']` or `['x']` depending on the input value.
2. The condition `not any_groupers` is True.
3. The condition `match_axis_length and level is None` is True.
4. Subsequently, the keys variable is wrapped in another list, leading to `keys = [com.asarray_tuplesafe(keys)]`.
5. The processing inside the loop then checks if the key `'x'` is present in the object, which causes a key error because the object does not have a key `'x'`.

### Proposed Fix:
1. Remove the conversion of `keys` to a list of a list when dealing with non-groupers.
2. Match the processing based on the format of the keys correctly to avoid key lookup errors.
3. Handle the situation where the keys are not found more gracefully to prevent key errors.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Existing code until key checks
    # ...
    else:
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # Remove the unnecessary conversion to a list of a list
    match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # what are we after, exactly?
    any_callable = any(callable(g) or isinstance(g, dict) for g in keys)
    any_groupers = any(isinstance(g, Grouper) for g in keys)
    any_arraylike = any(
        isinstance(g, (list, tuple, Series, Index, np.ndarray)) for g in keys
    )
    
    # is this an index replacement?
    if (
        not any_callable
        and not any_arraylike
        and not any_groupers
        and match_axis_length
        and level is None
    ):
        # Process based on the format of keys without conversion
        if isinstance(obj, DataFrame):
            all_in_columns_index = all(
                g in obj.columns or g in obj.index.names for g in keys
            )
        elif isinstance(obj, Series):
            all_in_columns_index = all(g in obj.index.names for g in keys)

        if not all_in_columns_index:
            keys = com.asarray_tuplesafe(keys)
    
    # Continue with the rest of the function
    # ...
```

By applying the suggested fix, the corrected function should now be able to handle the keys correctly and avoid raising key errors in the described scenarios.
