### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs due to a mismatch in handling the input key parameter. The function expects key to be either a string or a list of strings representing column names in the DataFrame. However, when `key` is passed as `['x']`, the buggy function treats it as a list of keys where each key should exist in the DataFrame object, causing a KeyError since `'x'` is not a key in the DataFrame columns.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check if `key` is a list. If it is a list, considering it as a single key and convert it to a single-element string list.
2. Update the logic to handle a single key passed as a string correctly.

### Bug-fixed Function
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        if len(key) == 1:
            key = [key[0]]
        else:
            raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

Applying this modification will allow the function to handle the `key=['x']` case correctly and prevent the KeyError from occurring.
