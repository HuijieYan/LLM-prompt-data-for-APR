### Analysis:
The `test_groupby_axis_1` test fails due to a `KeyError` when the `groupby` function is called with a `group_name` that is a list. This is because the `_get_grouper` function in `grouper.py` is expecting a scalar value for the `key`, but when a list is passed, it causes the function to raise a `KeyError`.

### Bug in the `_get_grouper` function:
In the `_get_grouper` function, there is an issue with the handling of the `key` parameter when it is passed as a list. The function expects `key` to be a scalar value but the code assumes that `key` is a scalar and not a list.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic in the `_get_grouper` function to handle the case where `key` is a list. We should iterate over each item in the list and process them accordingly.

### Solution:
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        groupers = []
        exclusions = []
        
        for k in key:
            grouper, exclusion, obj = _get_grouper(
                obj, key=k, axis=axis, level=level, sort=sort, observed=observed, mutated=mutated, validate=False
            )
            groupers.append(grouper)
            exclusions.extend(exclusion)
            
        values = {g.key for g in groupers if g.key is not None}
        
        return BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupers, sort=sort, mutated=mutated), values, obj

    # Rest of the _get_grouper function stays the same
```

With this modification, the `_get_grouper` function can now handle a list of keys when processing the groupers. This fix ensures that the function processes each key independently and generates the correct grouper objects for each key.

After making this change, the failing test case should now pass without raising a `KeyError` when a list of keys is passed.
