# Analysis:
The `_get_grouper` function in the `grouper.py` file is encountering a KeyError issue when handling the group_name that is passed as a list. The function fails to process the key when it is provided as a list instead of a single value.

# Error Location:
The error occurs in the section of the code where the function checks the type of the key parameter and processes it accordingly. When the key is passed as a list, the function fails to handle it correctly.

# Cause of the Bug:
The function expects the key parameter to be a single value, such as a string or an integer. If the key is passed as a list, it does not process it properly, leading to the KeyError.

# Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle a list of keys properly. It should iterate over the list of keys and process each key individually as it does for a single key.

# Bug Fix:

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        groupings = []
        exclusions = []
        for k in key:
            grouper = _get_grouper(
                obj,
                key=k,
                axis=axis,
                level=level,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                mutated=mutated,
                validate=validate,
            )
            groupings.append(grouper[0])
            exclusions.extend(grouper[1])
        
        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        
        return grouper, exclusions, obj

    # Rest of the original function code (unchanged)...
```

This modified function now handles a list of keys by iterating over the keys and processing each one individually. This ensures that the function can correctly handle the group_name parameter passed as a list and avoid the KeyError issue.
