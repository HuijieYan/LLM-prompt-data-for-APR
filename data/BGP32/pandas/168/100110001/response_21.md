### Bug Analysis:
The error occurs because the `group_name` parameter is passed as a list `['x']` instead of a single key `'x'` to the `df.groupby()` method, resulting in a KeyError when trying to process the input keys. The function `_get_grouper()` expects a single key for processing, but it throws an error in case of a list of keys.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the `_get_grouper()` function where it is attempting to process the input key, but the function logic is not handling a list of keys adequately.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function `_get_grouper()` can handle both single keys and lists of keys gracefully without raising any errors.

### Code Fix:
Here's the corrected version of the `_get_grouper()` function with the fix implemented:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Existing code remains the same
    ...

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]  # Ensure key is inside a list
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # rest of the code remains the same
    ...
```

By wrapping the `key` with `[]` when it's not a list, the function will now be able to handle both single keys and lists of keys correctly. This modification will address the KeyError when passing a list of keys to the `df.groupby()` method.
