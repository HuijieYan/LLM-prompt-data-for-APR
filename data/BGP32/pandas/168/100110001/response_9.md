### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_grouper` is failing when the `group_name` parameter is passed as a list `['x']`. The function fails with a `KeyError` when trying to process this list value. This issue is due to the fact that the function expects `key` to be either a scalar or a list, but when `group_name` is passed as `['x']`, it is not handled correctly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function expects `key` to be a scalar or a list, but when the input for `group_name` is passed as a list `['x']`, it is not properly converted to a list format, causing the function to fail with a `KeyError`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the issue, we need to ensure that when a scalar value is passed as `group_name`, it gets converted to a list format so that it can be processed correctly by the function.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Previous function code remains the same
    
    # Convert scalar key to a list if necessary
    if key is not None and not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = key

    # Rest of the function code remains the same
```

By making this change, the function will correctly handle both scalar and list inputs for `key`, ensuring that the function processes the `group_name` parameter correctly.
