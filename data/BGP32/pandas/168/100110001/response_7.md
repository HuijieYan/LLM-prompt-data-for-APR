### Analysis:
The `_get_grouper` function is failing to handle the case where `group_name` is a list, causing a `KeyError` to be raised. The error occurs when trying to handle the scenario where `key` is None and `level` is a list-like object with length greater than 1.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the assumption that `group_name` will always be a single key, which is true when it's a string. But when `group_name` is a list, the function fails to handle it correctly, resulting in the `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the function to properly handle cases where `group_name` is a list instead of a single key. We need to iterate over the elements of the `group_name` list and treat each element appropriately.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None

        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

                for idx, lvl in enumerate(level):
                    key = group_axis.get_level_values(lvl)
                    level[idx] = None

                level = None

                # If it's a list of column names, convert to list of arrays
                if isinstance(obj, DataFrame):
                    keys_found = []
                    for g in level:
                        if g in obj.columns:
                            keys_found.append(obj[g])
                        else:
                            raise KeyError(g)
                    key = keys_found

    # Rest of the function remains the same
``` 

After making this correction, the `_get_grouper` function should now be able to handle `group_name` as both a single key and a list of keys, thus passing the failing test.
