### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_grouper` is used to create and return a `BaseGrouper`. It contains a series of checks and operations related to grouping data.
2. The failing test `test_groupby_axis_1` uses the `groupby` method with `group_name` as either a string or a list to group the data in a DataFrame and sum the values.
3. The error occurs when the `group_name` is a list, resulting in a KeyError in the `_get_grouper` function. This is due to the processing logic not accounting for list-like `group_name`.
4. The issue arises from the handling of the `key` parameter, where the code expects a single key value and does not handle multiple keys (as in the case of a list).
   
### Bug Cause:
When `group_name` is a list, the function expects a single key value but receives a list instead. This leads to a KeyError as it tries to process the list as a single key.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the processing logic of the `key` parameter to handle list-like values appropriately. We should iterate over each value in the list of keys while creating the Grouping objects instead of treating the list as a single key.

### Corrected Implementation:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Existing code unchanged

    if isinstance(key, list):
        groupings = []
        exclusions = []
        for k in key:
            group, exclusion, obj = _get_grouper(
                obj, key=k, axis=axis, level=level, sort=sort, observed=observed, mutated=mutated, validate=False
            )
            groupings.extend(group)
            exclusions.extend(exclusion)
        return BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated), exclusions, obj
    
    # Existing code unchanged
```

By iterating over each key in the list when `key` is a list, we can correctly create the Grouping objects for each key. This modification ensures that the function can handle both single keys and lists of keys when grouping data, fixing the bug identified in the failing test.
