### Analysis:
- The function `_get_grouper` is responsible for creating and returning a `BaseGrouper`, which is an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
- The error message indicates a `KeyError` with a group name of 'x' when the `test_groupby_axis_1` test function is executed.
- The function tries to handle different scenarios based on the input parameters `key`, `axis`, and `level`.
- The issue seems to occur when `key` is a list and the condition for checking if `key` is in the object is not correctly handled.

### Bug:
When the `key` parameter is a list, the function does not properly handle the scenario where the list of keys is not present in the object, resulting in a `KeyError`.

### Fix:
To resolve the issue, we need to update the part of the code that checks for the existence of `key` in the object when `key` is a list.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Previous code here...

    # check if key is a list and at least one key is not present in the object
    if isinstance(key, list) and not all(k in obj for k in key):
        msg = "Interpreting list 'by' elements as keys, some not found in object."
        warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = [k for k in key if k in obj]  # Filter out keys not present in the object
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # Rest of the code remains the same...

    # Create the internals grouper and return it
    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
``` 

By filtering out only the keys present in the object from the list of keys when `key` is a list, we can avoid the `KeyError` and ensure that the function behaves as expected.
