### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs when the `group_name` parameter is passed as a list instead of a string in the `test_groupby_axis_1` test function. This leads to a `KeyError` when trying to group the DataFrame by the specified column names. The `_get_grouper` function in the `pandas/core/groupby/grouper.py` file is responsible for handling the grouping logic.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_grouper` function to correctly handle the case where `key` is passed as a list. The function should check if `key` is a list, and if so, treat each element in the list as a separate key for grouping.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_grouper` Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # code logic remains the same as original function up to this point

    if isinstance(key, list):
        groupings = []
        for k in key:
            groupings.append(Grouping(group_axis, k, obj=obj, name=None, level=None, sort=sort, observed=observed, in_axis=False))
        return BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated), [], obj

    # code logic remains the same as original function after this point
```

By checking if `key` is a list and creating separate `Grouping` objects for each element in the list, we ensure that the function can handle multiple keys for grouping. This modification will fix the bug and allow the function to handle the case where `group_name` is passed as a list in the test function.
