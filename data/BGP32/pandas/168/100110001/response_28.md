### Analysis:
The `KeyError` is raised when the function `_get_grouper` is trying to process the `group_name` parameter from the test code. The issue seems to stem from processing the `key` parameter, which is expected to be a list-like object but when `group_name = ['x']`, it is interpreted as a single key rather than a list of keys, leading to the `KeyError`.

### Bug Cause:
The code expects the `key` parameter to be a list-like object, but when `group_name` is passed as `['x']`, it interprets it as a single key instead of a list of keys. This leads to the `KeyError` when trying to process it later in the function.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `key` parameter is always treated as a list. If it is a single key, it should be converted to a list with that single key. Additionally, we need to handle the case when the `key` is a tuple correctly to avoid this kind of misinterpretation.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError("level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level))
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    if isinstance(key, (tuple, list)):
        key = list(key)
    else:
        key = [key]

    keys = key
    match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    any_callable = any(callable(g) or isinstance(g, dict) for g in keys)
    any_groupers = any(isinstance(g, Grouper) for g in keys)
    any_arraylike = any(isinstance(g, (list, tuple, Series, Index, np.ndarray)) for g in keys)

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By ensuring that `key` is always treated as a list, we prevent the misinterpretation of `['x']` as a single key. This should resolve the `KeyError` issue encountered with the failing test.
