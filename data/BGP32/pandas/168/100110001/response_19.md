### Analysis:
- The failing test `test_groupby_axis_1` is testing the `groupby` method with different group names on a DataFrame.
- The error message indicates a `KeyError` raised for the given group name.
- The failing test uses different group names: a string `'x'` and a list `['x']`.
- The error occurs when trying to group the DataFrame by the given group name along axis 1.

### Identified Issue:
- The issue lies in the `_get_grouper` function in the `pandas/core/groupby/grouper.py` file.
- The function fails to handle a list of group names when `group_name` is a list.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The `_get_grouper` function expects a single key for grouping but fails when a list is provided as the key.
- The function is not prepared to handle multiple keys for grouping, leading to a `KeyError`.

### Suggested Fix:
- Modify the `_get_grouper` function to handle multiple keys for grouping when `group_name` is a list.
- Check the type of `group_name` and adjust the logic to handle either a single key or a list of keys accordingly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Existing code
    
    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = key
    
    match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)
    
    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

By modifying the `_get_grouper` function to handle multiple keys for grouping when provided as a list, the bug should be fixed. This modification allows the function to handle both single keys and lists of keys for grouping successfully.
