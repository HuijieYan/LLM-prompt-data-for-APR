### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_grouper()` is failing to handle the case where `key` is passed as a list. In the failing test, the `group_name` is being passed as `['x']`, causing the error as the function is not prepared to handle list input for `key`.

### Bug Cause:
1. The function is checking if `key` is not an instance of list before treating it as a single key, leading to failures when `key` is actually a list.
2. When the input `group_name` is provided as a list `['x']`, the function incorrectly assumes it as a single key instead of treating it as a list of keys.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the part of the code where `key` is processed. The logic needs to be updated to handle both single key and list of keys appropriately.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper()` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(obj, key=None, axis=0, level=None, sort=True, observed=False, mutated=False, validate=True):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")
            
            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError("level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level))
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        return grouper, {key.key} if key.key else [], obj
    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple) and key not in obj and set(key).issubset(obj):
        warnings.warn("Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'.", FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
        key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = key

    # Rest of the function stays the same
```

With this corrected version, the `_get_grouper()` function should handle both single key and list of keys correctly, resolving the issue observed in the failing test case.
