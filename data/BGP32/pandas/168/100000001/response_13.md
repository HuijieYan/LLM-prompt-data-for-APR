### Analysis:
1. The function `_get_grouper()` takes multiple arguments and is responsible for creating and returning a `BaseGrouper`, which is an internal mapping of how to create grouper indexers.
2. The function processes different scenarios based on the input values of `key`, `level`, and `axis`.
3. The bug in the function seems to be related to the handling of `level` and `key` for `MultiIndex` objects. There are conditions within the function that check for `MultiIndex` instances and perform operations accordingly, but they may contain logical errors.
4. It appears that the bug could be due to incorrect handling of `level` when dealing with `MultiIndex` instances. The processing inside the `if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):` block might not be functioning as intended.
5. To fix the bug, careful examination and adjustment of the logic within the `if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):` block is needed to ensure proper handling of `level` and `key` variables for `MultiIndex` objects.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper()` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        elif not isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):  # Adding this condition
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")
    
    # Rest of the function remains the same...
```

In the corrected version, an additional condition has been added to handle `level` processing when `group_axis` is not a `MultiIndex`. This adjustment aims to address the potential bug related to `level` handling for different types of indexes. This change intends to maintain consistency and ensure proper behavior across different scenarios.
