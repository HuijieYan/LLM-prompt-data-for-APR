### Analysis:
1. The `is_in_axis` function seems to be problematic, as it tries to check if the key is present in the object's data items. However, `get_loc` method might not cover all cases for checking the presence of the key.
2. The `is_in_obj` function also has potential issues as it compares the id of the grouper with the id of the object's name, which might not provide a reliable check.
3. There are several conditional statements checking the type and conditions of the passed parameters without clear distinctions leading to potential logic errors.
4. The function involves handling of multiple levels, categorical data, and different types of keys which could introduce complexity.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug lies in the incorrect implementation of checking the presence of keys in the object, incorrect handling of groupings, and potential issues with compatibility checks between the keys and the object's attributes.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Improve the method of checking key presence in the object.
2. Refine the logic for creating groupings and exclusions based on the properties of the key.
3. Clarify the conditions for different key types to ensure proper handling.
4. Enhance the process of checking compatibility between the keys and the object's attributes.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    levels = [level] if not isinstance(level, (list, tuple)) else level
    keys = [key] if not isinstance(key, list) else key

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for gpr, level in zip(keys, levels):
        gpr_name = None
        in_axis = False

        if is_in_obj(obj, gpr):
            in_axis, gpr_name = True, gpr
            exclusions.append(gpr)

        elif is_in_axis(obj, gpr):
            in_axis, gpr_name = True, gpr
            if validate:
                obj._check_label_or_level_ambiguity(gpr)
            gpr = obj[gpr]
            exclusions.append(gpr)

        # Perform checks for categorical dtype and length
        if not in_axis:
            if is_categorical_dtype(gpr) and len(gpr) != obj.shape[axis]:
                raise ValueError(
                    f"Length of grouper ({len(gpr)}) and axis ({obj.shape[axis]}) must be the same length."
                )

        ping = Grouping(
            group_axis,
            gpr,
            obj=obj,
            name=gpr_name,
            level=level,
            sort=sort,
            observed=observed,
            in_axis=in_axis,
        )

        groupings.append(ping)

    if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
    elif len(groupings) == 0:
        index = Index([], dtype="int")
        groupings.append(Grouping(index, np.array([], dtype=np.intp)))

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This corrected version provides a clearer implementation of key presence checks, grouping creation, and handling of categorical data lengths. It enhances the overall logic flow and ensures a more robust function.
