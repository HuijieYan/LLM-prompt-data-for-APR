The buggy function `_get_grouper` has multiple potential error locations that might cause unexpected behavior. Here are some identified issues with potential fixes:

1. In the section where the function checks if `is_list_like(level)`, it tries to access `level[0]` without ensuring that `level` is a list-like object. To fix this, you can add a check to ensure `level` is a list-like object before accessing the first element.
   
2. The function raises a `ValueError` if `level` is a string and `obj.index.name` is not equal to `level`. This condition may not cover all scenarios where `level` can be a string, which may lead to unexpected errors. To improve this, consider adding additional checks or making the condition more specific.
   
3. The function tries to use `level` as an index when it checks against `level > 0 or level < -1` but lacks validation if `level` is an integer. Ensure that `level` is an integer value before performing this check to avoid potential errors.

To address these issues and improve clarity, here is a corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
    
    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level):
                level = level[0] if len(level) == 1 else level
            else:
                raise ValueError("Invalid level format!")
            
            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(f"Level name {level} does not match the index name!")
            elif isinstance(level, int) and (level > 0 or level < -1):
                raise ValueError("Level must be within bounds for MultiIndex!")
            else:
                raise ValueError("Invalid level type for the given axis!")
    
    # The rest of the function follows without modifications
    
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This corrected version includes improved checks and error handling to address potential bugs in the original function. Feel free to adjust or further enhance the function to match specific requirements or address additional issues.
