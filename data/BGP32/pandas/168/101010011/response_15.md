### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates a `KeyError` when trying to group by columns with the input `group_name = 'x'` or `group_name = ['x']`.
2. The bug seems to be related to handling the case when the column name is passed as the `key` parameter for grouping by columns.
3. The GitHub issue also highlights the issue of KeyError when trying to group by columns.
4. The issue seems to be caused by incorrect handling of column names for grouping by columns in the `_get_grouper` function.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not correctly handle the case when a column name is passed as the `key` parameter for grouping by columns. The function does not identify the column as a valid key for grouping and raises a `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_get_grouper` function to correctly handle column names when grouping by columns. Specifically, the function needs to check if the provided key is a valid column name and use it as the grouping criterion for columns.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if isinstance(level, str) and level != obj.index.name:
                raise ValueError("level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level))
            elif isinstance(level, int) and not group_axis.inferred_type == "MultiIndex":
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")
            level = None
            key = group_axis

    if isinstance(key, str) and key in obj.columns:  # Group by column name
        key = obj[key]

    # Rest of the function remains the same

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

By updating the logic to check if the provided key is a valid column name and using it for grouping by columns, the corrected function should now handle the grouping by columns as expected without raising a `KeyError`.
