### Bug Analysis:
The bug is in the `_get_grouper` function, specifically in handling the `key` parameter when it is a list. The function is not correctly processing the input when `key` is a list of column names. This leads to a `KeyError` when trying to group by columns, as observed in the failing tests provided.

### Bug Identification:
The issue arises from how the function processes the `key` parameter when it is a list. It fails to handle the list of column names properly, resulting in a `KeyError` when trying to group by columns.

### Bug Explanation:
The function `_get_grouper` fails to handle the case when `key` is a list of column names. It assumes that `key` is a single key or a Grouper object, leading to errors when a list of keys, like column names, is passed. This causes the function to raise a `KeyError` because it does not know how to handle multiple keys.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the `_get_grouper` function to properly handle a list of keys (in this case, a list of column names) when grouping by columns. We should iterate over each key in the list and process them accordingly to create the necessary groupings.

### Bug Fix and Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_grouper(obj, key=None, axis=0, level=None, sort=True, observed=False,
                 mutated=False, validate=True):
    """
    Create and return a BaseGrouper, an internal mapping of indexers.
    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    keys = key if isinstance(key, list) else [key]
    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for key in keys:
        if key in obj:
            in_axis, name, gpr = True, key, obj[key]
            if validate:
                obj._check_label_or_level_ambiguity(name)
        else:
            raise KeyError(key)

        if is_categorical_dtype(gpr) and len(gpr) != obj.shape[axis]:
            raise ValueError(
                f"Length of grouper ({len(gpr)}) and axis ({obj.shape[axis]}) "
                "must be the same length"
            )

        ping = Grouping(
            group_axis,
            gpr,
            obj=obj,
            name=name,
            level=level,
            sort=sort,
            observed=observed,
            in_axis=in_axis
        )
        groupings.append(ping)
        exclusions.append(name)

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

With this corrected version, the function is now capable of handling a list of keys (column names) when forming the groupings for grouping by columns. This fix should address the `KeyError` issue observed in the failing tests provided.
