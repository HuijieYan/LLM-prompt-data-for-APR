### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_grouper` is responsible for creating and returning a `BaseGrouper`, which maps how to create the grouper indexers using multiple `Grouping` objects.
2. The primary cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the case where the `key` parameter is a list of keys properly. This leads to a `KeyError` being raised when attempting to group by column names.
3. The error message from the failing test indicates that a `KeyError` is raised when trying to group by columns with the input as a list of column names.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the function to handle the case where the `key` parameter is a list of keys correctly.
5. The correction involves iterating over each key in the list and processing them accordingly to create the desired `BaseGrouper`.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # special handling for a list of keys
    if isinstance(key, list):
        groupings = []
        exclusions = []
        for k in key:
            value = obj[k]
            ping = Grouping(
                group_axis, value, obj=obj, name=k, level=None, sort=sort, observed=observed, in_axis=True
            )
            groupings.append(ping)
            exclusions.append(k)

        # create the internals grouper
        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, exclusions, obj

    # other existing logic for single key handling should remain unchanged
    # ...
```

By adding the logic to handle a list of keys in the input `key` parameter properly, we can fix the bug and ensure that grouping by column names works as expected.
