### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_grouper` is responsible for creating a BaseGrouper object for grouping data.
2. The error message indicates that a `KeyError` is being raised when trying to group by column names.
3. The GitHub issue points out that there is an issue with grouping by columns using the `groupby` function.
4. The bug seems to be related to handling column names correctly when grouping along the columns axis (axis=1).
5. The error occurs when trying to group by a single column name or a list of column names.

### Code Explanation:
1. The function `_get_grouper` is responsible for handling the creation of Grouping objects for grouping data.
2. The issue seems to be related to how column names are processed and validated when grouping along the columns axis.
3. The function goes through various checks to determine the appropriate key to use for grouping.
4. The error occurs when trying to check if the passed key (column name) is a valid grouper or not, leading to a `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic for handling column names as keys when grouping along the columns axis.
2. Ensure that column names are correctly processed and validated before creating Grouping objects.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if key is None and isinstance(group_axis, Index):
        key = group_axis

        if not isinstance(key, list):
            key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, list) and all(k in group_axis for k in key):
        keys = key
    else:
        raise KeyError(key)

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for i, gpr in enumerate(keys):
        ping = Grouping(
            group_axis,
            gpr,
            obj=obj,
            name=gpr if isinstance(gpr, str) else None,
            level=level if isinstance(level, int) else None,
            sort=sort,
            observed=observed,
            in_axis=True,
        )
        groupings.append(ping)

    if len(groupings) == 0:
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This corrected version ensures that the column names are correctly processed as keys for grouping along the columns axis, addressing the `KeyError` issue.
