### Issue Analysis:
1. The issue arises when trying to group by column names using `df.groupby('x', axis=1)`. It results in a `KeyError`.
2. The `_get_grouper` function is responsible for creating the grouper indexers.
3. The error occurs when trying to assert if the passed `key` for grouping is in one of the axes.
4. The cause of the issue is primarily in the section where it checks if the key is in the object.
5. The GitHub issue mentions the issue with grouping by column name(s) not working as expected.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic to properly handle grouping by column names.
2. Ensure proper handling of the key when checking if it's in the axis for grouping by column names.
3. Use the column names if the key is not found in the index when grouping by columns.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # handle grouping by column name(s)
    if not isinstance(key, list) and isinstance(key, str) and key in obj:
        keys = [key]
    elif not isinstance(key, list) or not all(isinstance(k, str) and k in obj for k in key):
        raise KeyError(key)
    else:
        keys = key

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for i, gpr in enumerate(keys):
        in_axis = True
        name = gpr
        if is_categorical_dtype(obj[gpr]) and len(obj[gpr]) != obj.shape[axis]:
            raise ValueError("Length of grouper must be the same length as axis")

        in_axis, name = True, gpr
        exclusions.append(name)

        ping = Grouping(
            group_axis,
            obj[gpr],
            obj=obj,
            name=name,
            level=None,
            sort=sort,
            observed=observed,
            in_axis=in_axis,
        )

        groupings.append(ping)

    if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
    elif len(groupings) == 0:
        groupings.append(Grouping(Index([], dtype="int"), np.array([], dtype=np.intp)))

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

By updating the function as shown above, the issue related to grouping by column names will be resolved, and the corrected function should now work as expected based on the provided test case and address the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
