### Analyzing the Buggy Function and Error Messages:

The buggy function `_get_grouper` is used to create and return a `BaseGrouper` object for pandas groupby operations based on the passed parameters. The error occurs when attempting to group by a key that is a column name in the DataFrame. The `KeyError` is raised because the function fails to correctly identify the key as a column name.

The failing test is triggered when trying to group along an axis with a key that is a column name in the DataFrame. This error prevents proper grouping by columns, leading to incorrect results.

### Potential Error Locations:

1. The bug may lie in the logic that checks whether the key is in the DataFrame's columns when identifying if it is a column name or not.
2. Handling of keys that are column labels rather than index labels.
3. Identifying the correct context for the key (axis, level) in the DataFrame.

### Cause of the Bug:

The bug occurs because the function does not correctly handle keys that are column labels rather than index labels. It fails to distinguish between column names and index names when forming the grouper for groupby operations. This results in the `KeyError` when attempting to group by a column name.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:

1. Modify the logic that determines if a key is a column name or index name to properly identify column labels.
2. Ensure that the function can handle keys that are column labels when forming the grouper object.
3. Update the code to differentiate between column names and index names when grouping.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

Based on the analysis, the fixed version of the `_get_grouper` function is provided below:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
    
    if key in obj.columns:
        key = obj[key].values
    
    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, [Grouping(group_axis, key, obj=obj, name=key, sort=sort, observed=observed, in_axis=True)], sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, [], obj
```

### Updated Changes:
1. Check if the key is in DataFrame's columns.
2. If the key is a column name, convert it to the corresponding values.
3. Create a `Grouping` object using the key as a column name.
4. Return the `BaseGrouper` object with the groupings.

This revised function should correctly handle grouping by column names and resolve the `KeyError` issue encountered in the failing test.
