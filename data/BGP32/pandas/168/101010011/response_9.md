### Correction

After analyzing the buggy function and the related GitHub issue, the key issue is that the function is not handling the case where a list of column names is passed as `key` in the `df.groupby(key, axis=1)` call. This leads to a `KeyError` when trying to group by the column names.

To fix this issue, we need to update the `_get_grouper()` function to handle the case when `key` is a list of column names. We should iterate over each column name in the list and create a grouping object for each column name.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper()` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
    
    if key is None:
        key = []

    if isinstance(key, list):
        groupings = []
        exclusions = []

        for col_name in key:
            if col_name in obj:
                if validate:
                    obj._check_label_or_level_ambiguity(col_name)
                ping = Grouping(group_axis, obj[col_name], obj=obj, name=col_name, sort=sort, observed=observed, in_axis=True)
                groupings.append(ping)
                exclusions.append(col_name)
            else:
                raise KeyError(col_name)

        if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
            raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
        elif len(groupings) == 0:
            groupings.append(Grouping(Index([], dtype="int"), np.array([], dtype=np.intp)))

        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, exclusions, obj

    # Proceed with the existing logic for handling single keys or Grouper objects
    # ...
```

In the corrected version above, we added a specific handling for a list of keys (column names) where we create Grouping objects for each column name and then combine them into a `BaseGrouper`.

By incorporating this change, the corrected function will now support grouping by a list of column names as intended. This modification should resolve the `KeyError` issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
