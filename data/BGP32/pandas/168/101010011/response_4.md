### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of the group name when it is provided as a list. The function fails to process the group name when it is passed as a list, resulting in a KeyError during grouping by columns.

### Error Cause:
1. The function `_get_grouper` in the Pandas library does not handle the case properly when the group name is provided as a list. This leads to an incorrect key being extracted for grouping by columns, causing a KeyError.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `_get_grouper` function to handle the group name properly when it is provided as a list. Ensure that the key is extracted correctly for grouping by columns in the DataFrame.
2. Update the logic to handle the case where the group name is passed as a list and adjust the key extraction process accordingly.

### Bug Fix:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # process the group name if it is provided as a list
    if isinstance(key, list) and len(key) == 1:
        key = key[0]

    # validate that the passed single level is compatible with the passed axis of the object
    if level is not None:
        ...
    
    # rest of the function remains the same

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

### Corrected Version:
I have modified the `_get_grouper` function in the Pandas library to correctly extract the key for grouping by columns when the group name is provided as a list. This correction should resolve the KeyError issue during grouping by columns.

After applying this fix, the function should be able to handle the group name passed as a list and perform the grouping operation without any errors.

### Note:
Make sure to apply this fix in the actual Pandas library codebase to address the bug permanently.
