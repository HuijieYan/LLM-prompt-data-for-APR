### Analysis:
The error occurs when the `test_groupby_axis_1` test tries to group the DataFrame `df` along the `['x']` axis. The error message shows that a `KeyError` is raised for the key `'x'`.

### Potential Error Location:
The error is most likely occurring in the section of the code where keys are processed to create the groupings.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the assumption that the key passed to the `_get_grouper` function should be a list, but in the failing test code, the key is provided as a list in one of the test parameters. The function implementation does not handle it correctly leading to the `KeyError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the code to handle both single keys and keys in a list appropriately.
2. If the key is not found in the DataFrame, interpret it as a list of keys rather than a single key.
3. Update the code to distinguish between single keys and lists of keys correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ...

    if isinstance(key, (tuple, list)):
        key_is_list = True
        keys = key
    else:
        key_is_list = False
        keys = [key]  # Wrap single key in a list for consistency

    if not key_is_list:
        if key is None:
            keys = [key]
            match_axis_length = False
        else:
            keys = [key]
            match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)
    else:
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # ...

```

With this modification, the function will correctly handle both single keys and keys within a list, ensuring that the keys along the axis are processed accurately.
