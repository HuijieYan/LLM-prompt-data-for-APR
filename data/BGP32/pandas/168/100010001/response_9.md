### Analysis:
The bug occurs when the `group_name` is passed as a list `['x']` which leads to a `KeyError`. This error arises from the function `_get_grouper` where it encounters the list `['x']` and raises a `KeyError` as it expects a single key but gets a list of keys instead.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to handle the scenario when the `key` variable is a list. We should convert the list of keys into a single key before proceeding further in the function.

### Corrected Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function which correctly handles the case where the `key` is passed as a list.

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Existing code...
    
    is_tuple = isinstance(key, tuple)
    all_hashable = is_tuple and is_hashable(key)

    if is_tuple:
        if (
            all_hashable and key not in obj and set(key).issubset(obj)
        ) or not all_hashable:
            msg = (
                "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than "
                "a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In "
                "the future, a tuple will always mean a single key."
            )
            warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
            key = list(key)

    # Correct the handling of key when it's a list
    if isinstance(key, list):
        if level is not None and len(key) == 1:
            key = key[0]
        else:
            raise ValueError("Multiple keys passed without a single level reference")

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # Existing code...

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

With this correction, the function will now properly handle the scenario when `key` is passed as a list, ensuring a single key is used for processing the groupby operation.
