### Analysis:
The error occurs when the `groupby` function is called with `group_name` as a list containing a single value. The function `_get_grouper` tries to process the input keys (`group_name`), and due to the way it handles the keys, it encounters a `KeyError` when the key is a list rather than a single value.

### Bug:
The bug is caused by the `_get_grouper` function expecting a single key when processing the `group_name` parameter but encountering a list of keys when the `group_name` parameter is passed as `["x"]`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_get_grouper` function to correctly handle the case when the `key` is a list of keys. We should treat each element in the list as a separate key and handle them accordingly.

### Updated and Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if key is not None and isinstance(key, list):
        # Process each key in the list individually
        grouper_list = []
        for single_key in key:
            grouper, exclusions, obj = _get_grouper(
                obj, key=single_key, axis=axis, level=level, sort=sort,
                observed=observed, mutated=mutated, validate=validate
            )
            grouper_list.append(grouper)
        return grouper_list, exclusions, obj

    # Rest of the function stays the same
```

### Explanation:
In the updated `_get_grouper` function, we check if the `key` parameter is a list. If it is a list, we iterate through each element in the list and call the `_get_grouper` function recursively with that individual key. This way, we ensure that each key in the list is processed correctly.

By making this modification, the function will be able to handle the case where `group_name` is passed as a list containing a single key, and the `KeyError` will be resolved.
