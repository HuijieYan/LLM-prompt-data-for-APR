### Analysis:
The errors are occurring due to incorrect handling of the input `key`. The `key` is expected to be a list, but the function is unable to handle single values properly.

### Location of Potential Error:
The error is likely occurring in the section where the function expects `key` to be a list but handles single values inconsistently.

### Cause of the Bug:
The function is designed to handle multiple keys passed as a list but fails to handle single values properly. This leads to a key error when trying to iterate over the keys.

### Suggested Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic to ensure that a single key is transformed into a list before iterating over it.
2. Check if the `key` is a list, and if not, convert it to a list before further processing.

### Bug-fix Solution:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None

        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        key = [key]  # Convert single key to a list

    keys = key
    match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    any_callable = any(callable(g) or isinstance(g, dict) for g in keys)
    any_groupers = any(isinstance(g, Grouper) for g in keys)
    any_arraylike = any(
        isinstance(g, (list, tuple, Series, Index, np.ndarray)) for g in keys
    )

    ...
    # other parts of the function remain unchanged
```

This correction ensures that even if a single key is passed, it will be converted to a list before further processing, preventing the key error.
