### Analysis:
The bug occurs when trying to group by a single key or a list of keys where the key(s) don't exist in the DataFrame columns or index. The error message indicates that a `KeyError` is raised for the given key value, causing the test to fail.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The `key` variable is expected to be a valid key for grouping, either a single key or a list of keys. 
2. If the key is not found in the DataFrame's columns, an error is raised.
3. In the failing test cases, the group name provided is 'x' or ['x'], which refers to the column name 'x'.
4. The current implementation is expecting the key to exist in the DataFrame's columns, causing the `KeyError` when the column name 'x' is not found.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `_get_grouper` function to handle the case where the key is not present in the DataFrame columns. If the key is not present in the columns, we should proceed assuming that the user wanted to group by the specified key(s) even if it's not in the columns or index. 

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_grouper(obj, key=None, axis=0, level=None, sort=True, observed=False, mutated=False, validate=True):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
    
    if level is not None:
        if key is None and is_scalar(level):
            key = level
            level = None
    
    keys = [key] if not isinstance(key, list) else key
    
    groupings = []
    exclusions = []
    
    for key in keys:
        if key is None or key in obj.columns:
            in_axis, name = True, key
            exclusions.append(key)
        else:
            in_axis, name = False, None
        
        if is_categorical_dtype(key) and len(key) != obj.shape[axis]:
            raise ValueError("Length of grouper and axis must be the same length")
        
        ping = Grouping(group_axis, key, obj=obj, name=name, level=level, sort=sort, observed=observed, in_axis=in_axis)
        groupings.append(ping)
    
    if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
    elif len(groupings) == 0:
        groupings.append(Grouping(Index([], dtype="int"), np.array([], dtype=np.intp)))
    
    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In the corrected function:
- The key(s) are directly used for grouping, even if they are not present in the DataFrame columns.
- If the key is present in the DataFrame columns, it is included in the exclusions list.
- The corrected function should now correctly handle the case where the key(s) are the same as the DataFrame column names.
