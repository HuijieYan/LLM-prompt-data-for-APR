### Analysis:
The error message indicates that a `KeyError` is being raised for 'x'. The function `_get_grouper` is responsible for creating and returning a `BaseGrouper`, but it seems there is an issue with how it handles the keys when passed as lists.

### Bug Location:
The bug is likely located in the section of the function that handles keys when they are lists or tuples.

### Cause of the Bug:
When the `key` is passed as a list `['x']`, it is not properly handled. The function raises a `KeyError` because it doesn't recognize the key correctly, assuming it should be a single value, but it's actually a list.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when the `key` is passed as a list correctly. When `key` is a list, we need to unpack the elements and process them individually as keys.

### Bug-fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None

        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, tuple):
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)
    else:
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False

    any_callable = any(callable(g) or isinstance(g, dict) for g in keys)
    any_groupers = any(isinstance(g, Grouper) for g in keys)
    any_arraylike = any(
        isinstance(g, (list, tuple, Series, Index, np.ndarray)) for g in keys
    )

    if (
        not any_callable
        and not any_arraylike
        and not any_groupers
        and match_axis_length
        and level is None
    ):
        if isinstance(obj, DataFrame):
            all_in_columns_index = all(
                g in obj.columns or g in obj.index.names for g in keys
            )
        elif isinstance(obj, Series):
            all_in_columns_index = all(g in obj.index.names for g in keys)

        if not all_in_columns_index:
            keys = [com.asarray_tuplesafe(keys)]

    if isinstance(level, (tuple, list)):
        if key is None:
            keys = [None] * len(level)
        levels = level
    else:
        levels = [level] * len(keys)

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    def is_in_axis(key):
        if not _is_label_like(key):
            try:
                obj._data.items.get_loc(key)
            except Exception:
                return False
        return True

    def is_in_obj(gpr):
        try:
            return id(gpr) == id(obj[gpr.name])
        except Exception:
            return False

    for i, (gpr, level) in enumerate(zip(keys, levels)):
        ...
```

This fixed version of the function now correctly handles the case when the key is passed as a list or tuple, ensuring the keys are unpacked and processed individually.
