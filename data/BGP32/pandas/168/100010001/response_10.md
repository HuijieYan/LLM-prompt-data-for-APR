### Analysis
The error message indicates a `KeyError` occurring when `raise KeyError(gpr)` is executed in the `_get_grouper` function. The failing test cases involve passing a single key as a string and a list containing the key as a string. The issue lies in how the function handles the `key` input parameter, especially when it is a list.

### Issue
1. When processing the `key` parameter as a list, the function erroneously treats each element in the list as a separate key instead of considering the list as a single key.
2. This leads to a situation where the function expects keys that may not exist individually in the DataFrame, resulting in a `KeyError`.

### Fix
To resolve the issue:
1. Adjust the handling of the `key` parameter to recognize a list of keys as a single entity when passed as a list.
2. Ensure that when iterating over the keys, if the current key is a list, treat the list as a single key rather than multiple keys.
3. Update the logic to check for key existence when processing a list of keys.

### Updated Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Function remains the same, with modifications below
    
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Additional key handling for list keys
    if isinstance(key, list):
        key = [key]  # Treat list of keys as a single entity

    # validate that the passed single level is compatible with the passed
    # axis of the object
    if level is not None:
        # Remaining code follows without modification
```

By treating a list of keys as a single entity, the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function should now handle both the single key and list key test cases without triggering a `KeyError`.
