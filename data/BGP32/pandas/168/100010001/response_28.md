### Bug Analysis:
The error occurs when the `group_name` is provided as a list `['x']` instead of a single element `'x'`. The error is raised in the `_get_grouper` function at the line `raise KeyError(gpr)` because when `group_name` is a list, `gpr` is also a list, causing the `KeyError` because it should be a single key, not a list.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the `key` handling section in the `_get_grouper` function. When processing the `key` variable, it checks if it is a list or not, and based on that, it operates on `keys`. The logic needs to differentiate between a single key and multiple keys.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the assumption that a single key is always provided, which results in the processing failing when a list of keys is provided. The function does not handle list input properly and raises a `KeyError` when processing a list of keys.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Verify if the `key` is a list and if so, handle it accordingly.
- When `key` is a list, convert it to a list of keys and process each key individually.
- Ensure that the function can handle both single keys and lists of keys to prevent the `KeyError`.
- Modify the logic to handle a list of keys properly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Existing code ...

    if isinstance(key, list):  # Handle list input
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

        for k in keys:
            if not is_scalar(k):
                raise ValueError("MultiIndex only supports single key")

            # Process each key individually
            if isinstance(k, str):
                if obj.index.name != k:
                    raise ValueError(f"level name {k} is not the name of the index")
            elif isinstance(k, int) and (k > 0 or k < -1):
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

    else:  # Handle normal single key input
        if isinstance(key, str):
            if obj.index.name != key:
                raise ValueError(f"level name {key} is not the name of the index")
        elif isinstance(key, int) and (key > 0 or key < -1):
            raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

        # Normalize key to a list for consistent handling
        keys = [key]

    # Existing code ...

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

### Correction Rationale:
- The fixed code checks if `key` is a list, and when it is, it processes each key individually to prevent the `KeyError`.
- It normalizes the key handling to always treat `keys` as a list, even if `key` is not a list, for consistent processing.
- The fix ensures that both single keys and lists of keys are processed correctly to eliminate the error.
