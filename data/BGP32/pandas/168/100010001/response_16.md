**Bug Analysis:**
- The bug arises due to a KeyError that is being raised when the function encounters a specific key value.
- The error occurs when the input `group_name` is passed as a list `['x']`, and the key value `'x'` is not present in the object's attributes.
- The current implementation of the `_get_grouper` function does not handle the situation where the input key is a list containing a single element, causing a KeyError when trying to access key values directly like attributes.
  
**Bug Fix Strategy:**
- Check if the key is a list, and extract the key value if it's a list containing a single item to handle the input parameter format properly.
- Handle the scenario where the key is passed as a list and include additional checks for this case to prevent the KeyError.
- Update the logic of key handling to accommodate both single and multiple key scenarios more effectively.
  
**Corrected Version of the Function:**

```python
from collections.abc import Iterable

def _flatten_keys(keys):
    flattened = set()
    for key in keys:
        if isinstance(key, Iterable) and not isinstance(key, str):
            flattened.update(key)
        else:
            flattened.add(key)
    return flattened

def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Previous code ...
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = _flatten_keys(key)
    else:
        keys = [key]

    match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # Updated logic for handling keys
    any_callable = any(callable(g) or isinstance(g, dict) for g in keys)
    any_groupers = any(isinstance(g, Grouper) for g in keys)
    any_arraylike = any(
        isinstance(g, (list, tuple, Series, Index, np.ndarray)) for g in keys
    )

    # Check for index replacement
    if not any_callable and not any_arraylike and not any_groupers and match_axis_length and level is None:
        if isinstance(obj, DataFrame):
            all_in_columns_index = all(
                g in obj.columns or g in obj.index.names for g in keys
            )
        elif isinstance(obj, Series):
            all_in_columns_index = all(g in obj.index.names for g in keys)

        if not all_in_columns_index:
            # Consider the keys as multiple keys to be used
            keys = [com.asarray_tuplesafe(keys)]

    if isinstance(level, (tuple, list)):
        if key is None:
            keys = [None] * len(level)

    levels = level if isinstance(level, list) else [level] * len(keys)

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    # Remaining code remains the same ...
```

This corrected version of the function will properly handle both single keys and multiple keys passed as a list to avoid triggering a KeyError when accessing key values. It ensures that the logic for handling keys is consistent and can accommodate various input scenarios.
