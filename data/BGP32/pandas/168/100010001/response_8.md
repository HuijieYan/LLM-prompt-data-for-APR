## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_grouper` is responsible for creating and returning a `BaseGrouper` object, which is an internal mapping for creating the grouper indexers based on various input parameters. The error message indicates a `KeyError` raised when the function tries to access a key that doesn't exist.

### Bug Identified:
The error occurs when the passed `key` is a list (`['x']` or `['x']`), and it fails to handle the list properly during processing.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check whether the `key` is a list, and if so, extract the key(s) properly for further processing.
2. Update the code logic to handle list-like `key`s appropriately.
  
### Solution:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Code logic that handles the passed key as a list properly
    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = True
    else:
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False

    # Rest of the code remains the same
    # ...
```

By updating the logic to differentiate between scalar (`key`) and list-like (`keys`) input for `key`, we can ensure that the function processes the keys correctly even when passed as a list.

This fix should address the bug and prevent the `KeyError` when dealing with group names passed as lists in the `groupby` call.
