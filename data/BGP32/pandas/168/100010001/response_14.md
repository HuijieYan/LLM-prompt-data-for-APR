### Analysis:
The error occurs when passing a list (`['x']`) as the group key parameter to the `groupby` function. The `groupby` method in Pandas should accept either a string or iterable (list-like object) as the group key. However, in this case, passing a list results in a `KeyError`.

### Bug Cause:
1. The `_get_grouper` function expects the `key` parameter to be either a string (a single key) or a list of keys. When a list is passed, the code fails to handle it correctly, resulting in a `KeyError`.
2. The function treats the key as a single key (`key = [key]`) when it should be treated as a list of keys.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when a list of keys is passed, it is correctly handled as multiple keys and not treated as a single key. The correction involves modifying how the function processes the `key` parameter when it is passed as a list, ensuring it is converted to a list of keys appropriately.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Existing code
    
    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]  # Convert single key to a list

    # Rest of the existing code
```

This correction ensures that when a list is passed as the `key` parameter, it is handled correctly as a list of keys rather than as a single key. This fix should resolve the `KeyError` issue when passing a list like `['x']` as the group key parameter.
