The buggy function seems to have issues with handling the input parameters correctly, especially regarding the `level` and `key` parameters. The function should properly process the input DataFrame, axis, key, validate flag, and other variables to create Grouping objects for each key before aggregating them into a BaseGrouper.

The bug seems to stem from how the function handles the `level` and `key` parameters and the initialization of `keys` inside the function. The function mistakenly assigns the `key` value to `keys` as a string when it should be a list.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `key` variable is always converted to a list before processing. Additionally, the conditionals for handling the `level` parameter should be adjusted to handle MultiIndex differently.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None

        elif not isinstance(group_axis, Index):
            raise NotImplementedError("Handling level is not yet supported for this type of axis.")

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key] if key is not None else []
    else:
        keys = key
        if len(keys) == 0:
            raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
        if len(keys) > 1 and not isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            raise ValueError("Multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex.")

    # Remaining implementation without modification
    
    # The rest of the function...
```

This corrected version should address the issues seen in the failing test cases by properly handling keys as lists and adjusting the processing of levels for different types of axes.
