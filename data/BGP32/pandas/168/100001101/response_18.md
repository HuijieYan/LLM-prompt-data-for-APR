The cause of the bug is related to the processing of the `key` parameter in the `_get_grouper` function. The function fails to handle cases where the `key` is a list of keys. This leads to an incorrect creation of the `groupings` variable, resulting in unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles the case when `key` is a list of keys. We should iterate over each key in the list and create the corresponding `Grouping` objects accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    if key is None:
        keys = []
    elif not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = key

    for gpr in keys:
        ping = (
            Grouping(
                group_axis,
                gpr,
                obj=obj,
                name=None,
                level=None,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                in_axis=False,
            )
            if not isinstance(gpr, Grouping)
            else gpr
        )
        groupings.append(ping)

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This corrected version should handle the input lists of keys correctly and generate the `groupings` variable appropriately based on each key in the list.
