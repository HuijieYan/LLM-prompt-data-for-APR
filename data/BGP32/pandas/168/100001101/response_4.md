### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_grouper` function is located in the section where it processes the `level` and `key` parameters. There are different conditions and checks based on whether the `group_axis` is a `MultiIndex` or not, leading to potential errors in detecting and handling the `level` correctly.

In Case 1, the function incorrectly handles the case when `level` is a list-like object with a single value. This causes issues with transforming the `level` appropriately leading to incorrect processing down the line.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To resolve the bug, we need to standardize the processing of the `level` and `key` parameters, regardless of the type of `group_axis`. This involves ensuring that the `level` is correctly handled as a single level if it is not a list-like object. Additionally, we need to ensure that the `key` and `level` are appropriately set based on the conditions and validations in the function.

### Corrected Function
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(level, (tuple, list)):
            levels = level
        else:
            levels = [level]

        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(levels) and len(levels) == 1:
                level = levels[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None

        else:
            if is_list_like(levels):
                nlevels = len(levels)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = levels[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("Multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "Level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("Level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj

    # As before, continue with the function for handling key
    # ...

```

With this corrected version, the function should accurately process the `level` parameter and proceed with the rest of the logic as intended without errors.
