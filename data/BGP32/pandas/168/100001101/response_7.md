Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the provided test cases, it seems that the issue lies in the handling of the `level` parameter when it is a list-like object. The function tries to access elements of the `level` variable without properly checking its type and structure, leading to potential indexing errors and causing the function to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to improve the handling of the `level` parameter, ensuring that it is correctly processed based on its type and content. Specifically, we need to address the conditions related to `level` being a list-like object to prevent potential errors.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        elif not is_list_like(level):
            level = [level]

        for lvl in level:
            if isinstance(lvl, str) and obj.index.name != lvl:
                raise ValueError(f"level name '{lvl}' is not the name of the index")
            if isinstance(lvl, int) and (lvl > 0 or lvl < -1):
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

    # rest of the function remains the same

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This corrected version enhances the logic around handling the `level` parameter, ensuring that it can handle both single values and list-like objects correctly. By making these adjustments, the function should now work as expected for the provided test cases.
