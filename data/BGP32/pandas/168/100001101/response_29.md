Based on the provided information, the buggy function `_get_grouper` has an issue when handling the `key` parameter that leads to incorrect behavior. The bug occurs when the key is passed as a single string instead of a list of strings in the expected input. This causes the function to fail to recognize the key correctly, resulting in incorrect processing.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `key` parameter is always properly handled as a list of keys. We can modify the function to check the type of the key input and convert it to a list if it's not already in that format.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    if isinstance(key, str):
        key = [key]  # Convert single key string to list

    # Rest of the function code remains unchanged
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
    
    # Validating key and level parameters
    # ... (rest of the function as it is)

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

By adding a conversion step for the `key` parameter to ensure it is always treated as a list of keys, the corrected function should now handle all input cases correctly and return the expected results.
