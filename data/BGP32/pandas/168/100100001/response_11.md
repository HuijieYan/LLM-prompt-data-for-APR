The bug in the `_get_grouper` function arises from the handling of MultiIndex when processing the `level` parameter. Here, the issue is that when `level` is a list with a single element, it is incorrectly unpacked as a scalar instead of a list.

### Cause of the Bug:
In the buggy function, the code checks if the `level` parameter is a list-like object with a single element. If it is, it unpacks the element as a scalar value instead of keeping it as a list. This causes issues when handling subsequent logic related to `level`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `level` parameter is always treated consistently as a list, even if it contains only one element. By modifying the logic related to unpacking `level`, we can avoid this inconsistency and prevent errors when processing MultiIndex.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # unchanged code ...
    
    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = [level[0]]  # Keep level as a list even with a single element

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level[0])  # Use level[0] to get key
                level = None

        else:
            # unchanged code ...
    
    # unchanged code ...
```

By modifying the handling of the `level` parameter to always treat it as a list (even when it contains a single element), we ensure a consistent behavior and resolve the bug in the function.
