### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_get_grouper` function lies in the section where the `keys` variable is set. When `key` is passed as a list, the code mistakenly assumes that each element in the list represents a separate key, leading to incorrect processing in the subsequent steps.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling the `key` parameter when it is passed as a list. We should treat the entire list as a single key instead of considering each element separately.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(key, (list, tuple)):
        keys = [key]  # Treat the entire list as a single key
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    ...
```

By fixing this issue, the function should now correctly handle the `key` parameter when it is passed as a list or tuple, and the failing test should pass successfully.
