### Bug analysis:
The bug in the `_get_grouper` function seems to be related to the handling of the `level` parameter when dealing with a MultiIndex. The function fails to correctly process the `level` parameter in certain cases, which leads to unexpected behavior and causes the failing tests.

### Bug explanation:
1. In the provided test case, when passing `level='x'` as a single level for grouping on a DataFrame with a MultiIndex, the function encounters issues with determining the correct key to use for grouping. This results in a failure to create the necessary Grouping objects for the BaseGrouper.

2. The function's logic for processing the `level` when dealing with MultiIndex data appears to be causing confusion and leading to incorrect outcomes in terms of key extraction and grouping.

### Bug fix strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to carefully review the logic related to processing the `level` parameter, especially when dealing with a MultiIndex. The key extraction and grouping creation should be adjusted to handle different scenarios correctly and ensure that the BaseGrouper is constructed accurately.

### Corrected function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Function logic here...

    if level is not None:
        # Simplified processing for MultiIndex
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_scalar(level):
                level_value = level
                level = group_axis.names.index(level)
            else:
                raise ValueError("level input must be a single level value")
        
        # Process single level for non-MultiIndex case
        else:
            level_value = level

        # Adapt the key extraction based on the level value
        if key is None:
            key = group_axis.get_level_values(level_value)
            
            # Set level to None after extracting key
            level = None

    # Rest of the function logic remains the same...
```

By updating the logic for handling the `level` parameter, specifically for MultiIndex scenarios, the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function should now handle the input data correctly and pass the failing tests.
