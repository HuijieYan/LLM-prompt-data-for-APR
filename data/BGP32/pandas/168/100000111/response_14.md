## Bug Fix

The bug in the `_get_grouper` function arises from the incorrect handling of the key parameter when it is a list. This results in unexpected behavior when trying to group by multiple columns.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when the key parameter is a list, we iterate over each element in the list and create separate Grouping objects for each element. This will correctly handle grouping by multiple columns as intended by the user.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    keys = key if isinstance(key, list) else [key]

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for i, gpr in enumerate(keys):
        # Check if the grouper is in the axis
        if gpr in group_axis:
            name = gpr
            in_axis = True
        else:
            name = None
            in_axis = False

        ping = Grouping(
            group_axis,
            gpr,
            obj=obj,
            name=name,
            level=level,
            sort=sort,
            observed=observed,
            in_axis=in_axis,
        )

        groupings.append(ping)

    if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This corrected version ensures that each element in the `key` list is processed separately to create the appropriate Grouping objects. This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and ensures that grouping by multiple columns works as expected.

By implementing this fix, the `_get_grouper` function now handles grouping by multiple columns correctly, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
