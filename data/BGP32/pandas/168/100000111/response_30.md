Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the expected input/output values from the test cases provided, here are the identified issues and the corrected version of the function:

### Issues:
1. The function does not handle the case where the key parameter is a string and the axis is specified as 1 correctly for grouping by columns.
2. The logic related to level handling when level is not None needs improvement.
3. The if-block and else-block for MultiIndex handling can be simplified for better readability.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic in `_get_grouper` to handle the grouping by columns correctly when the key is a string and the axis is specified as 1.
2. Simplify the MultiIndex handling for better readability and maintainability.
3. Improve the level handling logic.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
from pandas.core.groupby.ops import BaseGrouper
from pandas.core.indexes.multi import MultiIndex
from pandas.api.types import (
    is_scalar,
    is_list_like,
    is_categorical_dtype
)

def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        # Simplifying MultiIndex handling
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            level = level[0] if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1 else level
            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None

        else:
            # Simplifying level handling when level is a string or integer
            if is_list_like(level):
                level = level[0] if len(level) == 1 else level
            if isinstance(level, str) and obj.index.name != level:
                raise ValueError("level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level))
            elif not (-1 <= level <= 0):
                raise ValueError("level must be within the range -1 to 0 for non-MultiIndex")

    if isinstance(key, (str, list)):
        key = [key] if isinstance(key, str) else key
        keys = key
    else:
        keys = [key]

    if axis == 1 and all(isinstance(group, str) for group in keys):
        key = [group for group in group_axis if group in keys]

    # Other parts of the function remain unchanged

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

The corrected function should now handle the grouping by columns correctly when a string key and axis 1 are specified. It also includes simplifications for MultiIndex handling and better logic for level processing.

By applying the suggested fixes and incorporating them into the corrected function, the issue highlighted in the GitHub report should be addressed.
