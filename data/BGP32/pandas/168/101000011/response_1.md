### Analysis:
The bug seems to be related to grouping along columns (`axis=1`) where the `KeyError` is raised even though the intention is to group by columns. The issue raised on GitHub highlights the unexpected behavior when trying to group by columns.

### Identified Bug:
The bug seems to be related to the way column names are handled and checked within the `_get_grouper` function. The function is not correctly recognizing the column names and is leading to the `KeyError` even though the intent is to group by columns.

### Bug Cause:
The issue seems to be with how the function checks for column names and ambiguity in levels. The condition checking for column names and handling multiple levels is causing the issue when grouping by columns.

### Suggested Fix Strategy:
- Modify the logic for handling column names and levels specifically for grouped by columns (`axis=1`).
- Ensure that column names are processed correctly and no `KeyError` is raised due to ambiguity check.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
        if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
            level = level[0]

        if key is None and is_scalar(level):
            key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
            level = None
    else:
        if is_list_like(level):
            nlevels = len(level)
            if nlevels == 1:
                level = level[0]
            elif nlevels == 0:
                raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
            else:
                raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

        if level is not None:
            if obj.columns.name != level:  # Compare to column name instead of index name
                raise ValueError(
                    "level name {} is not the name of the columns".format(level)
                )
            level = None
            key = group_axis

    # Other parts of the function remain the same...

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This corrected version addresses the bug by ensuring that column names are checked correctly when grouping by columns. The comparison to the column name is made instead of the index name. This modification should resolve the `KeyError` issue when grouping by columns.
