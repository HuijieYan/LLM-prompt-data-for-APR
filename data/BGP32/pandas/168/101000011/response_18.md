### Analysis:
The reported issue states that when trying to group along columns using `df.groupby(by="x", axis=1).sum()`, a KeyError is raised even though "x" is a column name. The expectation is to group by columns based on the "x" column label. The `groupby` functionality in pandas should work as expected, grouping based on the specified column(s).

### Bugs in the Buggy Function:
1. The function is not handling grouping along columns correctly, leading to unexpected errors.
2. Errors might occur due to how the function processes keys and levels for columns.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of grouping along columns in the `_get_grouper` function. This function does not correctly process the key and axis when grouping along columns, leading to KeyErrors and unexpected behavior during grouping.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_grouper` function to handle column grouping correctly. Specifically, we need to ensure that keys and levels for columns are processed accurately, allowing for proper grouping along columns based on the specified key.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("Multiple levels are only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.columns.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "Level name {} is not the name of the columns".format(level)
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("Level > 0 or level < -1 is only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    if axis == 1:
        key = obj.columns

    # Rest of the function remains the same

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In the corrected version of the function, we explicitly handle grouping along columns by setting the `key` to `obj.columns` when `axis=1`. This modification ensures that the function correctly processes keys for column grouping, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
