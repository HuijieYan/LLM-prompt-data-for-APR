### Analysis:
The bug seems to be related to the handling of the grouping operation along the columns (axis=1) in the `groupby` function in the `pandas` library. The bug prevents the grouping by column names, causing a KeyError to be raised when attempting to group along columns.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison between the provided key and the DataFrame columns.
2. The handling of the key as a list of column names.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of the key when grouping along columns (axis=1). The function `_get_grouper` fails to properly identify and process the key as a column name and instead treats it as an index reference. This leads to a KeyError being raised during the grouping operation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the key provided for grouping along columns is correctly recognized as a column name and not mistaken for an index reference. This may involve adjusting the logic for identifying and processing the key when grouping along the columns.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function that addresses the bug described in the GitHub issue.

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Only process the key for column grouping along axis=1
    if axis == 1 and isinstance(key, str) and key in obj.columns:
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = True
    else:
        if level is not None:
            # Process level as before
            # ...
        else:
            # Handle key as before
            # ...

    if isinstance(level, (tuple, list)):
        if key is None:
            keys = [None] * len(level)
        levels = level
    else:
        levels = [level] * len(keys)

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for i, (gpr, level) in enumerate(zip(keys, levels)):
        # Adjust the logic for processing the key for column grouping
        if axis == 1 and isinstance(gpr, str) and gpr in obj.columns:
            in_axis, name, gpr = True, gpr, obj[gpr]
            exclusions.append(name)
        else:
            # Process keys for other cases as before
            # ...
        
        # Create the Grouping as before
        # ...

    if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
    elif len(groupings) == 0:
        groupings.append(Grouping(Index([], dtype="int"), np.array([], dtype=np.intp)))

    # Create the internals grouper as before
    # ...

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function should now correctly handle the key provided for column grouping along axis=1 and group the DataFrame by column names without raising a KeyError.
