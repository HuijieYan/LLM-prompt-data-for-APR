### Analysis:
The issue reported on GitHub highlights a problem with the `groupby()` function not allowing implicit selection by column names when specifying `axis=1`. The buggy function `_get_grouper` is responsible for creating a BaseGrouper object that maps how to create the grouper indexers, ultimately used for grouping operations. The bug seems to be related to handling the key selection for columns and levels.

### Identified Error Location:
The bug seems to be located in the section of the code where it determines the key for grouping by columns. The logic for handling the keys and levels is not appropriately checking for the case when grouping by columns with `axis=1`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect handling of the keys when grouping along columns (`axis=1`). The logic for identifying the key to group by columns is flawed, leading to unexpected behavior when trying to group along columns. This issue prevents implicit selection by column names.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Correctly identify the key for grouping along columns.
2. Adjust the logic for handling the key to ensure columns are properly selected for grouping.
3. Ensure that the selection of columns is explicit and handles both single and multiple columns correctly.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(level, (int, str)):
        level = [level]

    if isinstance(key, (int, str)):
        key = [key]

    if key is not None and axis == 1:
        keys = []
        if isinstance(key, list):
            keys = key
        else:
            keys.append(key)

        groupings = []
        exclusions = []

        for key in keys:
            if key in obj.columns:
                name = key
                in_axis = True
            else:
                raise KeyError(key)

            level = None

            ping = Grouping(
                group_axis,
                obj[key],
                obj=obj,
                name=name,
                level=level,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                in_axis=in_axis,
            )

            groupings.append(ping)

        if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj.columns):
            raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
        elif len(groupings) == 0:
            groupings.append(Grouping(obj.index, np.array([], dtype=np.intp)))

        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, exclusions, obj

    # Rest of the original _get_grouper function code for other cases

```

### Changes Made:
1. Updated key handling logic to explicitly check for column names when `axis=1`.
2. Ensure that the key is properly selected based on the input for grouping columns.
3. Adjusted the creation of Grouping objects to correctly handle grouping along columns.

This corrected version should address the issue reported on GitHub related to grouping by column names when using `axis=1`.
