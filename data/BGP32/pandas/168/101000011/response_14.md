### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_grouper` is responsible for creating and returning a `BaseGrouper` object, which is an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
2. The function involves checking the passed `level`, `key`, and `axis`, and then creating groupings based on these parameters.
3. The bug seems to arise from determining the grouping based on the columns' names and handling the grouping for multiple levels correctly.
4. The GitHub issue indicates a specific problem related to grouping along columns which leads to a `KeyError`.
5. The bug appears to be related to handling the column labels correctly and grouping based on the columns.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function does not handle the grouping along columns correctly when passing column labels as keys. It fails to recognize the column names as valid groupers, leading to a `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic for handling column labels as keys to ensure that column names are recognized as valid groupers.
2. Address the scenario where column labels are passed for grouping, avoiding the `KeyError` caused by incorrect handling of column names.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
from pandas.api.extensions import ExtensionArray

def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        elif isinstance(group_axis, Index) and is_hashable(level):
            key = level
            level = None

    if key is None or (isinstance(key, str) and key in group_axis):
        key = group_axis
        level = None

    # Handle grouping along columns
    if isinstance(key, ExtensionArray):
        key = com.asarray_tuple_safe(key)

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

In the corrected version, we handle the scenario where the `key` is None or a valid column label to ensure correct grouping along columns. This modification should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and prevent the `KeyError` when grouping by columns.
