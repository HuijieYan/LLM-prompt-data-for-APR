### Analyzing the buggy function and related functions:

1. The buggy function `_get_grouper` is responsible for creating and returning a `BaseGrouper`, which contains internal mappings of how to create grouper indexers for groupby operations.
   
2. The function involves handling different cases for the `key`, which can be a single key, multiple keys, Groupers, or tuples of keys.
   
3. The issue reported on GitHub involves groupby along columns not working as expected, specifically when using `axis=1` and passing column names in the `by` parameter.

### Error Location and Cause of the Bug:

The bug likely originates from the code block where the function checks whether the keys are in the index or not. This check for keys being in the index causes issues when the keys are column names in the case of grouping along columns (axis=1).

The bug seems to arise from the conditions that check for keys in the index and attempt to provide warnings when the tuple keys are being interpreted as single keys.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:

To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for handling keys in the `_get_grouper` function. Specifically, we should differentiate between grouping by index and grouping by columns. When grouping by columns, we should handle the keys as column names and avoid unnecessary checks related to the index.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function that addresses the issue reported on GitHub and fixes the bug:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None

        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                pass  # No need to check index name for columns
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    # Handle grouping by columns case
    if isinstance(key, str):  # Column names should not go through checks for index-related keys
        key = obj[key]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In this corrected version, when `key` is a string (column name), it directly accesses the column from `obj` instead of trying to check it as an index key. This change should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure grouping by columns works as expected.
