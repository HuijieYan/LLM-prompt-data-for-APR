The bug in the `_get_grouper` function lies in the section where it handles the MultiIndex case and the single level case. The if-block and else-block are almost the same, which suggests that the MultiIndex instance check can be removed, but there are some processes only for non-MultiIndex in the else-block. This inconsistency is causing issues with the function.

To fix this bug, we can simplify the code by removing the unnecessary MultiIndex instance check and merging the common logic for both cases. We should also handle the level as a list-like object when it contains multiple levels. Additionally, we need to update the checks for level name and level boundaries to ensure they are valid.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if is_list_like(level):
            if len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
            else:
                raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

        if isinstance(level, str):
            if obj.index.name != level:
                raise ValueError("level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level))
        elif level > 0 or level < -1:
            raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")
        key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
        level = None

    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        return grouper, {key.key} if key.key is not None else [], obj
    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj

    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        keys = list(key)
    else:
        keys = [key] if not isinstance(key, list) else key

    any_callable = any(callable(g) or isinstance(g, dict) for g in keys)
    any_groupers = any(isinstance(g, Grouper) for g in keys)
    any_arraylike = any(isinstance(g, (list, tuple, Series, Index, np.ndarray)) for g in keys)

    if not any_callable and not any_arraylike and not any_groupers:
        if isinstance(obj, DataFrame):
            all_in_columns_index = all(g in obj.columns or g in obj.index.names for g in keys)
        elif isinstance(obj, Series):
            all_in_columns_index = all(g in obj.index.names for g in keys)
        
        if not all_in_columns_index:
            keys = [com.asarray_tuplesafe(keys)]

    if isinstance(level, (tuple, list)):
        if key is None:
            keys = [None] * len(level)
        levels = level
    else:
        levels = [level] * len(keys)

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

By simplifying the logic and handling the MultiIndex and single level cases consistently, we can fix the bug in the `_get_grouper` function. This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
