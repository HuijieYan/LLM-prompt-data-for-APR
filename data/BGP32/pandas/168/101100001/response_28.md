To fix the bug in the `_get_grouper` function, we need to address the logic related to the `if isinstance(key, Grouper):` condition. This condition checks if the `key` parameter is an instance of the `Grouper` class and then calls the `_get_grouper` method on it. However, the code does not handle cases where the `key` is an instance of `Grouper` but its `key` attribute is `None`.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function that addresses this issue:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # existing code

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # added fix: handle case where key is Grouper instance with key=None
    if isinstance(key, Grouper) and key.key is None:
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        return grouper, set(), obj

    # existing code

    # rest of the existing implementation
```

With this modification, the code will correctly handle the case when the `key` is a `Grouper` instance with a `None` key attribute, ensuring that the function behaves as expected in all scenarios.

By making this change, the `_get_grouper` function will now handle the situation where the key is an instance of `Grouper` with a `None` key attribute correctly, and the function should pass the failing test provided.
