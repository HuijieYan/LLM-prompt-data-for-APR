Based on the GitHub issue and the provided buggy function, the bug seems to be related to the grouping operation when using `groupby()` along columns with the `axis=1` parameter. The issue described the problem as not being able to group by column names using `groupby(by="x", axis=1)`.

### Potential Error Location:
The bug is likely to be related to the handling of the `key` parameter in the `_get_grouper()` function, where the grouping mechanism for columns may not be correctly implemented, leading to a KeyError when trying to group by column names.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not handle grouping by column names correctly when `axis=1`. The key parameter processing and the handling of columns during the grouping operation might not be appropriate, leading to incorrect behavior and KeyError.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function `_get_grouper()` needs to be revised to correctly handle grouping by columns using the `axis=1` parameter. The key parameter should be processed to allow grouping by column names effectively.

### Bug Fix and Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper()` function tailored to address the bug described:

```python
def _get_grouper(obj, key=None, axis=0, level=None, sort=True, observed=False, mutated=False, validate=True):
    if axis == 1 and is_list_like(key):
        key = [col for col in key if col in obj.columns]

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if axis == 1:
        if key is None:
            key = obj.columns
        key = [col for col in key if col in obj.columns]

    # Rest of the function remains the same

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

You can replace the existing `_get_grouper()` function with this corrected version to address the issue reported in the GitHub thread.

By fixing the grouping mechanism for columns in the `_get_grouper()` function, the provided cases, along with the reported GitHub issue, should be resolved.
