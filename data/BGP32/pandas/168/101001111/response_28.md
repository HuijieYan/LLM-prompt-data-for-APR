## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of the `key` parameter in the `_get_grouper` function. When the `key` is a single string representing a column name (like `'x'`), the function fails to correctly handle it for grouping along the columns axis.

The issue arises in determining the correct grouping based on the `key` parameter. The code does not differentiate between grouping by index or columns effectively, leading to an error in column grouping when a single column name is provided as the `key`.

## Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `_get_grouper` function to handle column name grouping correctly. Specifically, when a single column name is passed as the `key`, it should be treated as a column grouping operation.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Logic to handle key as a column name for column grouping
    if isinstance(key, str) and axis == 1:
        if key not in obj.columns:
            raise KeyError(f"Column '{key}' not found in DataFrame.")
        else:
            key = [key]

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
    
    # Rest of the function code remains unchanged
    .
    .
    .
```

With this modification, the function will correctly handle column name grouping when a single column name is provided as the `key`.

By making this change, the function should now handle the test cases correctly and resolve the issue described in the GitHub report.
