Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the provided cases, it seems that the bug lies in the comparison involving `is_tuple` and subsequent conversion of `key` to a list if it's a tuple. The condition for converting a tuple `key` to a list is incorrect, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the conditions for converting `key` to a list should be revised to handle the case when `key` is a tuple. Additionally, the warning message related to interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys should be adjusted accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Remaining code remains the same
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        msg = (
            "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than "
            "a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In "
            "the future, a tuple will always mean a single key."
        )
        warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
        key = list(key)
    
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

By updating the tuple conversion logic, the function should now correctly handle cases where `key` is passed as a tuple. This correction should address the issue reported on GitHub related to grouping by columns not working as expected.
