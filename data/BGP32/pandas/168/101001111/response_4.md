The bug in the `_get_grouper` function seems to be in the section where it checks whether the key is a tuple and tries to convert it to a list. This conversion logic is currently causing issues. To fix the bug, we need to handle the conversion from a tuple key to a list key more effectively.

A suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
- Update the logic for converting a tuple key to a list key so that it correctly handles the key conversion without triggering errors.
- Ensure that the conversion process is robust and does not raise unnecessary warnings or errors.

We can correct the function as follows:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps

    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        if any(not is_hashable(k) for k in key):
            msg = (
                "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than "
                "a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In "
                "the future, a tuple will always mean a single key."
            )
            warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
        key = list(key)
    
    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # Rest of the function remains the same

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

By updating the key conversion logic handling tuples correctly and converting them to lists as needed, we can address the issue and satisfy the expected input/output values as described in the failing test cases.

This corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and handle the test cases appropriately.
