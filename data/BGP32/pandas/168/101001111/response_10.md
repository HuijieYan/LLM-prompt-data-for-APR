## Bug Explanation
In the buggy function `_get_grouper`, there are issues with the handling of the `key` and `level` parameters when processing multilevel indices, causing unexpected behavior when grouping by columns.

1. The code does not correctly handle the situation where `level` is a list of levels when dealing with a single level groupby operation.
2. Incorrect validation checks for `level` when dealing with a MultiIndex.

These issues lead to incorrect indexing and key validation, resulting in unexpected behavior when attempting to group by columns.

## Solution Strategy
To fix the bug, the following changes can be made:
1. Improve the handling of single level and MultiIndex levels in the `level` parameter.
2. Adjust the validation checks to properly handle the given parameters and their compatibility with the object's axis.

The focus should be on ensuring that the `level` parameter is correctly processed based on whether it is a single level or a list of levels and that proper validation is performed for the key. Additionally, adjustments should be made to key validation when dealing with a MultiIndex.

## Corrected Code
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None

        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj

    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj

    # Ensure key handling for columns groupby
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
        if is_hashable(key):
            if key not in obj and set(key).issubset(obj):
                # Convert tuple key to a list when not found in columns
                keys = [list(key)]
        else:
            # Warn and convert tuple 'by' to list of keys
            msg = (
                "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than "
                "a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In "
                "the future, a tuple will always mean a single key."
            )
            warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)

        if not isinstance(key, list):
            keys = [key]

    # Process as normal when key is a single item
    else:
        keys = [key]

    # Remaining code stays the same
    ...
```

By correcting the handling of the `key` parameter and the validation checks for `level`, the corrected function should now properly handle single level and MultiIndex situations when grouping by columns, eliminating the issues leading to unexpected behavior.
