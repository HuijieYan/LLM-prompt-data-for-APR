## Bug Explanation

The bug occurs in the `_get_grouper` function when handling the `key` parameter. The current implementation of the function does not properly handle the case when `key` is a list, causing issues when trying to group along the columns (axis=1). This results in a KeyError when attempting to group by columns, even though the intention is to use the column label "x".

The bug is mainly due to how the function processes the `key` parameter and constructs the groupings based on it. The current implementation does not correctly handle the case when `key` is a list of keys for column grouping.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the function handles the `key` parameter, especially when it is a list. We should ensure that the function correctly interprets a list of keys as column labels for grouping along the columns.

We will modify the logic related to processing the `key` parameter and adjust the creation of groupings accordingly. By properly handling the case when `key` is a list, we can resolve the issue with grouping along the columns.

Now, let's provide a corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if key is None:
        return BaseGrouper(group_axis, [], sort=sort, mutated=mutated), [], obj

    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
    else:
        keys = [key]

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for gpr in keys:
        if gpr in obj.columns:
            in_axis, name, gpr = True, gpr, obj[gpr]
            exclusions.append(name)
        elif gpr in obj.index.names:
            in_axis, name = True, gpr
            exclusions.append(name)
        else:
            raise KeyError(gpr)

        ping = Grouping(
            group_axis,
            gpr,
            obj=obj,
            name=name,
            level=level,
            sort=sort,
            observed=observed,
            in_axis=in_axis,
        )

        groupings.append(ping)

    if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function addresses the issue by properly handling a list of keys for column grouping. Now, the function should effectively group along the columns by using the provided column labels.

By implementing this fix, we resolve the bug related to grouping by columns when using a list of keys.
