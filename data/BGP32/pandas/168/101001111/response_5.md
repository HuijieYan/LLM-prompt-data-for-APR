Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the provided expected values and types, the bug seems to be related to how the key parameter is handled when grouping along the columns (axis=1). The key parameter is expected to be a single string representing a column name when grouping along columns, but the current implementation doesn't handle this correctly.

To fix the bug, the key parameter should be treated as a single string representing a column name when grouping along columns. The function should check if the key is a string and then proceed to create the necessary Grouping objects based on the column name.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if axis == 1 and isinstance(key, str):
        gpr = key
        
        # create the Grouping
        ping = Grouping(
            group_axis,
            gpr,
            obj=obj,
            name=gpr,
            level=level,
            sort=sort,
            observed=observed,
            in_axis=True,
        )

        return BaseGrouper(group_axis, [ping], sort=sort, mutated=mutated), [gpr], obj

    # For other cases, proceed with the existing logic
    # ...
```

This correction ensures that when grouping along columns (axis=1) with a single string key representing a column name, the function correctly creates the Grouping object and returns the BaseGrouper with the specified key.

By applying this fix, the function should now correctly handle grouping along columns by a single column name.
