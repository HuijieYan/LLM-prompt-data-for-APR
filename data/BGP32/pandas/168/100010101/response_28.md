The buggy function has a bug that results in a KeyError when the input key is provided as a list rather than a single value. The function is designed to handle single keys but fails to manage a list of keys properly.

The bug occurs when the function checks if the `key` is a tuple and all elements in the tuple are hashable. In this case, it converts the tuple to a list. However, when the key is a list, the function does not handle it correctly, leading to the KeyError.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the part of the code where the `key` is checked for being a tuple and all elements being hashable. Instead of converting it to a list directly, we should check if the `key` is a list and process it accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Previous code omitted for brevity

    # Handle the case where key is a list
    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)
    else:
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False

    # Previous code omitted for brevity
```

With this modification, the function should be able to handle a list of keys correctly. This will ensure that the KeyError issue is resolved when providing a list as the key parameter.

The corrected function above has been updated to handle the bug in correctly processing a list of keys.
