The issue in the provided function arises from the key input parameter being incorrectly processed when passed as a list. The function expects the key to be a single value, not a list, resulting in a `KeyError` when using the key in subsequent processes. To resolve this bug, we need to adjust the handling of key inputs that are in list format.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        # Handle key as a single item if it's a list with one element
        if isinstance(level, list) and len(level) == 1:
            level = level[0]

        if key is None and is_scalar(level):
            key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
            level = None

    # check if the key is a list, and only choose the first element as the key
    if isinstance(key, list):
        key = key[0]

    # Remaining code unchanged

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

By adding a specific check for the `key` input parameter when it is a list, we ensure that only the first element is used as the key. This correction prevents the `KeyError` that occurred due to using a list as the key in the buggy function.

Now, when running the failing tests with the corrected function, it should pass successfully without raising any `KeyError`.
