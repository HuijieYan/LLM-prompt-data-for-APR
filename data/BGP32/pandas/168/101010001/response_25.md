### Analysis:
- The error occurs when trying to group by a column name that is not present in the DataFrame columns after passing a list of column names.
- The error is raised specifically in the section where the actual grouper should be `obj[key]` or `obj[name]`.
- The error message shows a `KeyError` which indicates that the key ('x') is not found in the object.
- The issue arises due to a discrepancy in handling a list of keys passed for grouping.

### Bug:
- When a list of keys is passed for grouping, the function incorrectly handles it as a single key lookup and raises a `KeyError` if the key is not found directly.

### Strategy:
- When receiving a list of keys, iterate through each key in the list and perform the grouping operation for each key.

### Correction:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    keys = key if isinstance(key, list) else [key]
    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for key in keys:
        if key not in obj:
            raise KeyError(key)

        ping = Grouping(
            group_axis,
            obj[key],
            obj=obj,
            name=key,
            level=level,
            sort=sort,
            observed=observed,
            in_axis=True,
        )

        groupings.append(ping)
        exclusions.append(key)

    if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
    elif len(groupings) == 0:
        groupings.append(Grouping(Index([], dtype="int"), np.array([], dtype=np.intp)))
    
    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This corrected version will iterate over each key in the list of keys passed for grouping and handle them correctly, preventing the `KeyError` when a key is not found.
