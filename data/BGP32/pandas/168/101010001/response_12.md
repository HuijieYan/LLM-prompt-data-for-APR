### Analysis:
1. The function `_get_grouper` is responsible for creating and returning a `BaseGrouper`, which is an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
2. The error occurs when the `group_name` parameter passed to `df.groupby()` is a list instead of a single value.
3. The `KeyError` is raised when the function is trying to determine the grouping based on the keys provided.
4. The error arises when trying to handle a list of keys in the function `_get_grouper`.
5. The design of the function is not capable of handling a list of keys properly.
   
### Bug:
The bug arises when the input `key` is a list instead of a single key, causing a `KeyError` because the function is not prepared to handle multiple keys at once.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the function to handle a situation when the `key` is a list of keys.
- Iterate through each key in the list and process them accordingly.

### Solution:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        groupings = []
        exclusions = []
        for k in key:
            grouper, exclusion, _ = _get_grouper(
                obj, key=k, axis=axis, level=level, sort=sort, observed=observed, mutated=mutated, validate=validate
            )
            groupings.append(grouper)
            exclusions.extend(exclusion)
        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, exclusions, obj

    # Existing code for handling single key
    # ...

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

By iterating through each key in the list and processing them accordingly, we can now handle a list of keys correctly within the `_get_grouper` function.
