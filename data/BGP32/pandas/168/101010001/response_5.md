### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_grouper` is responsible for creating and returning a `BaseGrouper`, an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers. The function is composed of multiple `Grouping` objects, indicating multiple groupers. The main issue in the function is related to handling the `key` parameter, especially when it is given as a list. The current implementation does not properly handle a list of keys, which causes a `KeyError` when trying to process the keys.

### Bug Location
The bug is located in the part of the code that deals with converting the `key` parameter into a list of keys in case it is a tuple. This part is not correctly converting the tuple into a list of keys, leading to issues later in the function when processing the keys.

### Bug Cause
The function is experiencing a bug due to incorrect conversion of the `key` parameter when it is a tuple. When the `key` is a tuple representing multiple keys, the function should convert it into a list of keys. However, the current implementation is not properly converting the tuple into a list, leading to keys being processed incorrectly and causing a `KeyError` later in the function.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when the `key` parameter is a tuple, it is correctly converted into a list of keys. This will prevent the `KeyError` and ensure that the function processes the keys properly.

### Corrected Version
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    Corrected version of the _get_grouper function
    """

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")
            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")
            level = None
            key = group_axis

    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        all_hashable = all(map(is_hashable, key))
        if all_hashable and not set(key).issubset(obj):
            msg = (
                "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than "
                "a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In "
                "the future, a tuple will always mean a single key."
            )
            warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
            key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    ...

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In the corrected version, we correctly handle the case where the `key` parameter is a tuple, converting it into a list of keys. This ensures that the keys are processed properly throughout the function and avoids the `KeyError` issue.
