### Analysis:
- The error message indicates a `KeyError` being raised in the `_get_grouper` function.
- The function `_get_grouper` is responsible for creating a `BaseGrouper` object that defines how the indexing is to be performed.
- The `KeyError` is raised when the function is trying to access a key that is not present in the object.
- The error message provides the key that caused the error, which is `'x'` in this case.
- The function is handling different scenarios for `key`, which can be a list of keys, a single key, a `Grouper` object, or a `BaseGrouper` object.

### Bug:
- The bug occurs when the `key` parameter is passed as a list, like `['x']`.
- The function is treating the list as a single key and trying to access it directly from the object, which results in a `KeyError`.

### Solution:
- When `key` is provided as a list, it should be handled as a list of keys rather than a single key.
- The function should iterate over each key in the list and process them accordingly.

### Updated Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
    else:
        keys = [key]

    # Process each key in the list
    groupings = []
    exclusions = []
    for i, gpr in enumerate(keys):
        # Modify the conditions based on the key in the list
        if not _is_label_like(gpr):
            try:
                obj._data.items.get_loc(gpr)
            except Exception:
                raise KeyError(gpr)

        if is_categorical_dtype(gpr) and len(gpr) != obj.shape[axis]:
            raise ValueError(
                (
                    "Length of grouper ({len_gpr}) and axis ({len_axis})"
                    " must be same length".format(
                        len_gpr=len(gpr), len_axis=obj.shape[axis]
                    )
                )
            )

        ping = (
            Grouping(
                group_axis,
                gpr,
                obj=obj,
                name=gpr,
                level=None,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                in_axis=True,
            )
            if not isinstance(gpr, Grouping)
            else gpr
        )

        groupings.append(ping)

    if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
    elif len(groupings) == 0:
        groupings.append(Grouping(Index([], dtype="int"), np.array([], dtype=np.intp)))

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

### Explanation:
- The updated function checks if the `key` parameter is a list, in which case it iterates over each key in the list.
- For each key in the list, it checks if the key is label-like and handles key errors appropriately.
- It creates the `Grouping` objects for each key and populates the `groupings` list with them.
- Finally, it builds the `BaseGrouper` object based on the processed keys and returns it along with any exclusions.

### Outcome:
The corrected function should now be able to handle a list of keys correctly without raising a `KeyError` and pass the failing test cases.
