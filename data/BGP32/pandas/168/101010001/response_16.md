### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_grouper` is responsible for creating and returning a `BaseGrouper` object based on the input parameters. The function goes through a series of checks and validations to determine the appropriate grouping strategy based on the provided inputs.

The error message indicates a `KeyError` being raised with the problematic key being 'x'. This error occurs when the function is trying to handle a key that doesn't exist in the object.

### Bug:
The bug in the `_get_grouper` function arises when processing the key parameter provided to the function. Specifically, the issue occurs when dealing with a list of keys, as the code logic assumes a list-like key structure but encounters a single key instead, resulting in a `KeyError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To address the bug, we need to handle the case when the key is a single element within a list-like structure. This situation is identified by checking if the `key` variable is a list and consists of only one element. If this is the case, the code logic should extract the single element from the list to proceed with further processing.

### Improved `_get_grouper` Function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Existing code as it is up to the point before error occurs

    if isinstance(key, list) and len(key) == 1:
        key = key[0]

    # Continue with the rest of the function logic
```

By adding the check for a list with a single element in the `key` argument, we can avoid the `KeyError` and ensure the function can process the input correctly.

This adjusted code snippet should fix the bug and allow the `_get_grouper` function to handle list-like keys containing a single element without raising any errors.
