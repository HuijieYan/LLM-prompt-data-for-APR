### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_grouper` is intended to create and return a `BaseGrouper` which represents an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers. This function is a key component in the groupby operations of pandas.
- The error message indicates a `KeyError: 'x'` is raised when the function is called with `key='x'` as a string and `'x'` as a list.
- The error occurs in the section where the function processes the list of keys to be used for grouping the data. In particular, the logic for handling cases where the keys are passed as a list or a tuple is where we should focus on.

### Bug Identification:
- The bug arises when the `key` parameter is passed as a string in the `level` variable, leading to a `KeyError` being raised.
- The function has specific logic to handle cases where `key` is passed as a list. However, it doesn't cater to the scenario where `key` is passed as a single string.
- In the failing tests, when `group_name = 'x'` or `group_name = ['x']`, the function tries to process `'x'` as a key directly, which results in a `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the logic for handling `key` to account for cases where `key` is a single string.
- Check if `key` is a string and convert it to a list before further processing to ensure consistency.
- Ensure that the logic for handling both list and string keys is factored into the function to avoid KeyError issues.

### Bug Fix:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Existing code remains the same up to this point
    
    if isinstance(key, str):  # Convert single string key to a list
        key = [key]
    
    # rest of the code remains the same
    # ...
```

Applying this change will resolve the `KeyError: 'x'` issue when running the failing tests with `group_name = 'x'` or `group_name = ['x']`.
