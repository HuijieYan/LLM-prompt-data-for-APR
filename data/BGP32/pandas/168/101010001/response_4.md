### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates a `KeyError` raised when trying to group by a column name that does not exist.
2. The error is occurring in the `_get_grouper` function, specifically in the logic where it checks if the group key is present in the object.
3. The cause of the bug is related to handling the `key` parameter, which is passed to the function. When the key is supposed to be a list of keys, it needs to be converted to a list from a tuple to avoid errors.
4. The strategy to fix the bug is to ensure that the `key` parameter is correctly handled as a list, even if it is passed as a tuple. Additionally, proper validation should be done to check the existence of keys before raising an error.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def _get_grouper(obj, key=None, axis=0, level=None, sort=True, observed=False, mutated=False, validate=True):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(key, tuple):  # Convert tuple to list
        key = list(key)

    if level is not None:
        # Rest of the function remains the same
        # No more changes needed here
```

Applying this fix ensures that if `key` is passed as a tuple, it will be converted to a list before further processing. This modification should resolve the `KeyError` when grouping by a column name that does not exist.
