### Analysis:
- The function `_get_grouper` is responsible for creating and returning a `BaseGrouper`, which is an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
- The error message is a `KeyError` raised when trying to group by a key that is not available in the object being grouped.
- The function is dealing with the keys provided for grouping, validating them against the object's axis and level specifications.

### Bug:
- The bug seems to be related to handling the key for grouping when it is provided as a list.
- The function is not correctly handling the case where the key is provided as a list, resulting in a `KeyError` because it fails to locate a key that exists in the list format.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Verify that the function correctly handles both single keys and keys provided as a list.
- Ensure that the function properly extracts and processes the keys according to their specified format.

### Corrected Version of `_get_grouper` Function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(key, (list, tuple)):
            keys = list(key)
        else:
            keys = [key]

        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if isinstance(level, (list, tuple)):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError("level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level))
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]

    # rest of the function remains the same
```

This corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function should properly handle keys provided as both single values and as lists, avoiding the `KeyError` issue when grouping by keys that are available in list format.
