The bug in the `_get_grouper` function lies in the condition where it checks if the level is a string. It should be checking if the level is a single value and not a list-like object. This error results in incorrect handling of the level parameter in the function.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the section of the code that handles the level parameter. Specifically, we should remove the check for a string level and focus on treating level as a single value if it is not a list-like object.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None

        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if level is not None and not is_scalar(level):
                raise ValueError("Level must be a single key")

            # NOTE: Removed the code checking if level was a string

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    # Rest of the function remains the same

    # Return statement as it was
```

The corrected version now properly handles the level parameter as a single key rather than a list-like object. This should fix the bug and allow the function to work correctly with the provided test cases.
