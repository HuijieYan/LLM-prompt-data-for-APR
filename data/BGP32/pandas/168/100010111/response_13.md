## Bug Analysis
The bug occurs when trying to group by columns using the `groupby` function with the `axis=1` argument. The function `_get_grouper` has logic to handle different cases of grouping, but there is a problem when the `key` parameter is a list of column names. The function fails to correctly handle the list of keys when `is_tuple` is False and incorrectly raises a `KeyError`.

The issue is related to the way the function processes the `key` parameter when it is a list. The function incorrectly interprets the list as a single key rather than treating it as a list of keys.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the logic related to handling the `key` parameter when it is a list, ensuring that the function correctly handles a list of keys for grouping by columns.
2. Check and update the logic for handling cases when `key` is a list to ensure that correct behavior is maintained.
3. Ensure that the function properly constructs the `keys` list when `key` is a list of column names.

## Corrected Function
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Other existing code remains the same

    if is_tuple:
        if all_hashable and all(key_elem not in obj for key_elem in key):
            # Interpret tuple 'by' as a list of keys
            key = list(key)
            msg = (
                "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than "
                "a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In "
                "the future, a tuple will always mean a single key."
            )
            warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=4)

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # Rest of the code remains the same
```

By updating the logic for handling the `key` parameter when it is a list, the corrected function should now properly group by columns using the list of column names provided in the `key` parameter.
