To fix the bug in the `_get_grouper` function, we need to address the issue where a `KeyError` is raised when trying to group by column names. This error occurs because the function is not correctly handling the case where the `key` parameter is a list of column names. 

To resolve this issue, we need to update the logic in the function to properly handle the case where `key` is a list of column names. This involves iterating over each column name in the list and creating Grouping objects for each column separately.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    Corrected version of the _get_grouper function to handle groupby for column names.
    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if key is not None:
        if isinstance(key, list):
            groupings = []
            for k in key:
                if k in obj.columns:
                    grouper = Grouping(
                        group_axis,
                        obj[k],
                        obj=obj,
                        name=k,
                        level=level,
                        sort=sort,
                        observed=observed,
                        in_axis=True,
                    )
                    groupings.append(grouper)
                else:
                    raise KeyError(k)
        else:
            if key in obj:
                groupings = [
                    Grouping(
                        group_axis,
                        obj[key],
                        obj=obj,
                        name=key,
                        level=level,
                        sort=sort,
                        observed=observed,
                        in_axis=True,
                    )
                ]
            else:
                raise KeyError(key)
    else:
        groupings = [
            Grouping(
                group_axis,
                group_axis,
                obj=obj,
                level=level,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                in_axis=True,
            )
        ]

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, [], obj
```

This corrected version of the function properly handles the case where the `key` parameter is a list of column names. It iterates over each column name, creates a Grouping object for that column, and then combines all the Grouping objects into a BaseGrouper.

By making these adjustments, the function should now correctly handle the grouping operation for column names and prevent the `KeyError` from being raised.

This fix should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and ensure that the function behaves as expected when grouping by columns.
