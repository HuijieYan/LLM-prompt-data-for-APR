## Bug Explanation

The bug occurs in the `_get_grouper` function due to a KeyError being raised when using a column name (str) as the grouping key along the columns. The issue is caused by an incorrect check for the column existence in the DataFrame when processing the key. The function does not correctly handle the case when the key is a column name.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug in the `_get_grouper` function, we need to adjust the logic for processing the key that is a column name. We should ensure that the function properly handles valid column names when grouping along the columns.

## Corrected Code

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if key is None and isinstance(level, int):
            key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)

    if isinstance(key, str) and key in obj.columns:
        key = obj[key]

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    any_callable = any(callable(g) or isinstance(g, dict) for g in keys)
    any_groupers = any(isinstance(g, Grouper) for g in keys)
    any_arraylike = any(
        isinstance(g, (list, tuple, Series, Index, np.ndarray)) for g in keys
    )
    
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly handle column names passed as the key for grouping along the columns, preventing the KeyError that was previously raised.

This correction should resolve the issue reported in the related GitHub ticket.
