Based on the provided buggy function and the failing test cases, the main issue seems to be with the handling of the key parameter when it is passed as a list in the _get_grouper function. The function is expecting a single key value but fails to handle the case when key is a list of keys properly. This leads to a KeyError when trying to group by columns using a list of column names.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic in the _get_grouper function to properly handle the case when key is a list. We should iterate over each key in the list and create Grouping objects for each key before combining them into a BaseGrouper.

Here is the corrected version of the _get_grouper function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        groupings = []
        exclusions = []
        
        for k in key:
            gpr = k
            name = None

            if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex) and is_scalar(k):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(k)

            if k not in obj:
                raise KeyError(k)

            exclusions.append(k)

            if is_categorical_dtype(obj[k]) and len(obj[k]) != obj.shape[axis]:
                raise ValueError("Length of grouper and axis must be the same length")

            ping = Grouping(
                group_axis,
                obj[k],  # Using obj[k] to get the appropriate grouper
                obj=obj,
                name=name,
                level=level,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                in_axis=True,
            )
            groupings.append(ping)

        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, exclusions, obj

    else:
        # Existing logic for single key
        ...
```

In this corrected version, we iterate over each key in the list if key is a list, handle the key appropriately for each column, and create Grouping objects before combining them into a BaseGrouper. This fix should resolve the KeyError while grouping by columns using a list of column names.

Please test this corrected version against the failing test cases to ensure that it now passes successfully.
