Based on the analysis provided, the issue seems to be related to how the `key` parameter is handled in the `_get_grouper` function. The function should properly handle the case when `key` is a list of column names, like in the failing tests. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the section of the code that processes the `key` before creating the grouper. We should iterate over the list of column names in `key` and create a Grouping object for each column to correctly handle the grouping by columns.

Below is a corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function that should address the issue:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    levels = [level] * len(key) if level is not None else [None] * len(key

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for col, column_name in zip(key, obj.columns):
        if col not in obj.columns:
            raise KeyError(col)
        
        gpr = obj[col]
        name = column_name

        ping = Grouping(
                group_axis,
                gpr,
                obj=obj,
                name=name,
                level=None,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                in_axis=True
            )

        groupings.append(ping)
        exclusions.append(name)

    if not groupings:
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This version properly iterates over the list of column names in `key`, checks if the columns exist in the DataFrame, and creates a Grouping object for each column.

Please test this corrected version with the failing tests to ensure that the issue is resolved. Let me know if you need further assistance.
