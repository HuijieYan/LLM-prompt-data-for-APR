### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_grouper` is responsible for creating a `BaseGrouper` object which handles how to create the grouper indexers based on the input parameters. The issue reported on GitHub highlights a situation where grouping by column names using `axis=1` is not working as expected.

### Error Locations:
1. The section where the function checks for `is_in_obj(gpr)` and `is_in_axis(gpr)` to determine if the grouper is based on an object or a label might be causing issues with correctly identifying column names.
2. The conversion of a tuple key to a list key is also a potential area where the bug might be present.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug might be due to how the function handles grouping by column names when `axis=1`. The discrepancy in processing column names versus index names might lead to a KeyError when trying to group by column names.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies column names when grouping by `axis=1`. This could involve modifying the logic around determining if a grouper is based on an object or a label and handling column names appropriately.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # remaining code not shown for brevity
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
    
    if level is not None:
        if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
            level = level[0]

        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):  
            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str): 
                if axis == 1 and obj.columns.name != level:
                    raise ValueError("level name {} is not the name of the columns".format(level))
            elif level is not None and not isinstance(level, int):
                raise ValueError("level must be either a string or integer")
            elif level is not None and (level <= 0 or level >= obj.columns.nlevels):
                raise ValueError("level must be a valid column level index")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    # remaining code not shown for brevity
```

In the corrected version of the function, we have added a specific check when `axis=1` to compare the level name with the column names instead of the index names. This change should address the issue reported on GitHub regarding grouping by column names.
