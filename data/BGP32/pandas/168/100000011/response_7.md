### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_grouper` is a key internal function within the `pandas` library for creating and returning a `BaseGrouper`. The function is responsible for mapping how to create the grouper indexers. The bug within this function relates to the ability to group by columns (axis=1) using column labels. This bug is in line with the GitHub issue that describes how attempting to group by columns leads to a KeyError, even though the intent is to group by the column labels.

### Error Locations:
1. The bug can be identified in the section where the function checks if a passed level is compatible with the object's axis. The code snippet that checks for `level > 0 or level < -1` can cause issues with MultiIndex.
2. The issue is also present in the section where it checks for the presence of a Grouper or a BaseGrouper type in the `key` variable.

### Cause of Bug:
The bug arises due to incorrect handling of grouping by columns using column labels. The code does not correctly identify the intention to group by columns based on the column labels passed as the `key` parameter.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the function correctly handles grouping by columns based on column labels.
2. Improve the logic related to handling the `key` parameter to allow grouping by column labels.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
from pandas.core.groupby.groupby import Grouper
from pandas.core.groupby.grouping import Grouping

def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Handling grouping based on levels
    if level is not None:
        if not isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level):
                if len(level) == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                else:
                    raise ValueError("Multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.columns.name != level:
                    raise ValueError("Level name {} is not the name of the columns".format(level))
            elif not (-len(obj.columns) <= level < len(obj.columns)):
                raise ValueError("Level can only be within the range of column indices")

            key = group_axis

    # Handling grouping by columns
    if isinstance(key, str) and axis == 1 and isinstance(obj, DataFrame):
        # Convert column label to column index for grouping
        if key not in obj:
            raise KeyError("Column label '{}' not found".format(key))
        key = obj.columns.get_loc(key)

    grouper, exclusions, _ = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False) if isinstance(key, Grouper) else (None, [], obj)

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This corrected version improves the logic for handling grouping by columns based on column labels. It properly checks for column labels and converts them to column indices for grouping. The bug related to KeyError when attempting to group by columns should be resolved with this corrected version.
