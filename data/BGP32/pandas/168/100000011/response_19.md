### Analysis:
The GitHub issue is related to the `groupby` function not working as expected when grouping along columns by name (axis=1). The bug seems to be caused by the function `_get_grouper` not handling the grouping by column names correctly. 

### Error Location:
The error seems to be happening in the section of the function where it validates the key (column names) and processes them for grouping by columns.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the function not correctly identifying and processing the column names for grouping along columns (axis=1). This leads to the KeyError when trying to group by column names.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
The bug can be fixed by properly handling the column names when grouping along columns. Specifically, the function should correctly identify and process column names for grouping by axis=1.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:
```python
def _get_grouper(obj, key=None, axis=0, level=None, sort=True, observed=False, mutated=False, validate=True):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if not isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if isinstance(level, (list, tuple)) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
            obj._data._level_for(level)

    if isinstance(key, str) and key in obj.columns:
        grouper = obj[key]
        if isinstance(grouper, Series):
            grouper.name = key
        return BaseGrouper(group_axis, [Grouping(group_axis, grouper, obj=obj, name=key, level=level, sort=sort, observed=observed)], sort=sort, mutated=mutated), [], obj
    elif isinstance(key, (list, tuple)):
        grouper = obj[key]
        sub_columns = obj.columns.intersection(key)
        if len(sub_columns) == 0:
            raise KeyError("KeyError: '{0}' not in columns".format(key))

        groupings = [Grouping(group_axis, obj[col], obj=obj, name=col, level=level, sort=sort, observed=observed) for col in sub_columns]
        return BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated), [], obj
    
    raise KeyError("KeyError: '{0}' not in columns".format(key))
```

This corrected version of the function should address the issue reported in the GitHub thread by properly handling the grouping by column names when `axis=1`.
