### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_grouper` is responsible for creating and returning a `BaseGrouper` object, which is used internally to map how to create the grouper indexers. The function handles multiple cases for creating groupers based on various input parameters like `key`, `axis`, `level`, etc.

The GitHub issue points out a problem where grouping along columns using `groupby(by="x", axis=1)` raises a `KeyError`, even though "x" is a column name. This suggests that the issue might be related to how the function `_get_grouper` handles grouping along columns.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by how the function handles the `key` parameter in the context of grouping along columns. The function expects a list of keys for column-wise grouping. However, the code does not properly handle this case, leading to the `KeyError` when trying to group along columns.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly processes the `key` parameter for column-wise grouping. The function needs to differentiate between grouping along rows and columns and handle the column-wise grouping case properly. This involves adjusting how the function interprets the `key` parameter and creates the necessary groupings for columns.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if group_axis.is_column and is_list_like(key) and all(col in obj.columns for col in key):
        keys = [obj[col] for col in key]
        groupings = []

        for key in keys:
            ping = Grouping(
                group_axis,
                key,
                obj=obj,
                name=key.name,
                level=None,
                sort=sort,
                observed=observed,
                in_axis=True,
            )
            groupings.append(ping)

        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, [], obj

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # Handle row-wise grouping and other cases as before
```

In this corrected version, when grouping along columns (`axis=1`) with a list of column keys, the function properly creates groupings based on the specified columns. This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug related to grouping by column names.
