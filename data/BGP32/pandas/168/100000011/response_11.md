### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_grouper` is responsible for creating a `BaseGrouper` object that serves as an internal mapping for creating the grouper indexers. The function tries to handle various scenarios for creating the grouper, including grouping by index, columns, functions, or `Grouper` objects.

Considering the GitHub issue related to `GroupBy(axis=1) Does Not Offer Implicit Selection By Columns Name(s)`, the issue revolves around the `df.groupby(by="x", axis=1).sum()` line, which aims to group by columns but results in a `KeyError`. This behavior indicates that there is a bug in handling grouping by columns in the `_get_grouper` function.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug stemmed from the logic within the function that checks and processes the provided `key` parameter when grouping. The function has specific checks and conditions for handling groupers, keys, tuples, and different types of keys, which might lead to unwanted behaviors when trying to group by columns.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and address the GitHub issue, the function `_get_grouper` needs to have the correct handling for column-based grouping (`axis=1`) using columns names. This involves ensuring that the function correctly identifies and processes the columns name when grouping by columns.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
        raise ValueError("Grouping by columns is not supported with MultiIndex.")

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(level, str):
            if obj.columns.name != level:
                raise ValueError("level name {} is not the name of the columns".format(level))
        elif level > 0 or level < -1:
            raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with columns")

        key = group_axis

    if axis == 1:
        if key is None or isinstance(key, str):
            key = obj.columns

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for gpr in key:
        if is_categorical_dtype(gpr) and len(gpr) != obj.shape[axis]:
            raise ValueError(
                "Length of grouper ({len_gpr}) and axis ({len_axis}) must be the same length".format(
                    len_gpr=len(gpr), len_axis=obj.shape[axis]
                )
            )
        ping = Grouping(
            group_axis,
            gpr,
            obj=obj,
            name=str(gpr),
            level=level,
            sort=sort,
            observed=observed,
            in_axis=True,
        )
        groupings.append(ping)

    if len(groupings) == 0:
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In the corrected version:
- Checks are added to handle grouping by columns when `axis=1`.
- Proper processing of the columns names is performed to facilitate grouping by columns.
- Error handling and validations are improved for grouping by columns.

This corrected version should address the bug and enable proper grouping by columns, resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
