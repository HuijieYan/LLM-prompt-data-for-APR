### Analysis:
The provided buggy function `_get_grouper` is responsible for creating and returning a `BaseGrouper` object, which handles the indexing for grouping operations in pandas. The function deals with various cases related to `key`, `level`, and the input object to determine the correct grouping parameters.

### Identified Errors:
1. The function does not correctly handle the case when grouping is performed on columns using the `axis=1` argument.
2. The function does not properly validate the passed `key` and `level` parameters in the context of grouping by columns.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is causing the function to raise a `KeyError` when attempting to group by columns, as it is not properly checking for columns' names. This discrepancy leads to the mentioned issue where grouping by `x` (columns) raises an error, even though `x` is a valid column name.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to update the `_get_grouper` function to correctly handle the case of grouping by columns using the `axis=1` argument. This involves ensuring that the function recognizes column names as valid keys for grouping operations.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    Corrected version of the _get_grouper function to handle grouping by columns.
    """

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if axis == 1 and is_list_like(key) and all(k in obj for k in key):
        key = [obj.columns.get_loc(k) for k in key]

    return BaseGrouper(group_axis, key=key or level, sort=sort), [], obj
```

### Proposed Changes:
1. Check if the `axis` is 1 and all elements of the `key` are in the columns of the DataFrame.
2. If the conditions are met, convert the column names into integer locations using `get_loc`.
3. Return a `BaseGrouper` object with the updated `key` and `group_axis` for columns.

### Outcome:
By implementing the proposed changes in the `_get_grouper` function, the issue related to grouping by columns using `axis=1` should be resolved, and the function should now correctly handle grouping by column names.
