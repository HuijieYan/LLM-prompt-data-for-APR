### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_grouper` is responsible for creating a `BaseGrouper`, which is an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers. The bug reported in the GitHub issue mentions that when trying to group by columns using `df.groupby(by="x", axis=1).sum()`, a `KeyError` is raised even though "x" is a column name.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The conditional statements and logic within the function that handle the grouping by level or key might be causing the issue.
2. The check for whether the key is in the object and setting up the groupings based on keys could be incorrect.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by the logic in the function that handles grouping by columns. The condition that checks whether the key is in the object might not be handling column names correctly. This causes a KeyError when attempting to group by columns.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Adjust the logic in the function to correctly handle grouping by columns.
2. Ensure that the function properly distinguishes between grouping by index and grouping by columns.
3. Update the code to handle column names as keys when grouping by columns.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.

    """

    if axis == 1 and key is not None:
        if isinstance(key, str):
            if key in obj.columns:
                return BaseGrouper(obj.columns, [Grouping(obj, obj[key], name=key)], sort=sort, mutated=mutated), [], obj

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Rest of the function implementation stays the same

``` 

This corrected version includes a specific check for grouping by columns when `axis=1` and the key is a string representing a column name. It creates a `BaseGrouper` based on the column name, avoiding the KeyError issue when grouping by columns.
