### Analysis:
1. The provided buggy function `_get_grouper` is responsible for creating and returning a `BaseGrouper` object based on the input parameters such as `key`, `axis`, `level`, etc., for the purpose of grouping data in pandas.
   
2. The issue described on GitHub is related to the incorrect behavior of `groupby()` when trying to group along columns by column name(s).

3. The potential error locations in the buggy function:
   - Incorrect handling of grouping along columns with column names.
   - Issues related to checking if the grouping is on columns.
   - Handling of keys, levels, and groupings for columns.
   - Potential errors when dealing with categorical data types.

4. The cause of the bug:
   - The bug arises due to incorrect handling of grouping along columns in the `_get_grouper` function. The function does not properly identify and process the grouping by column names, leading to the KeyError issue highlighted in the GitHub problem description.

5. Strategy for fixing the bug:
   - Correctly identify and distinguish between grouping by index and grouping by columns.
   - Ensure proper handling of keys, levels, and groupings when grouping by columns.
   - Address any potential issues related to handling categorical data types while grouping.

### Code Correction:

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function to address the issue reported on GitHub:

```python
# Updated and Corrected _get_grouper function
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Correct handling for grouping along columns by column names
    if level is None and key is not None and isinstance(key, str) and axis == 1:
        key = obj[key]

    # Rest of the original function implementation remains unchanged

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

By updating the `_get_grouper` function as shown above, we ensure that when grouping along columns by column names, the function correctly identifies the key as a column and processes it accordingly. This correction should resolve the KeyError issue when using `groupby(by="x", axis=1)` as reported on GitHub.
