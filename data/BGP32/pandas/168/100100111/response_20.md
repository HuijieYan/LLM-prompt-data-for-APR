Based on the provided buggy function, failed test, expected input/output values, and the GitHub issue, the bug in the `_get_grouper` function appears to be related to how the function handles grouping along columns when the key is specified as a string.

The cause of the bug seems to be the incorrect handling of the key parameter when it is a string representing a column name. This leads to a KeyError when trying to perform the groupby operation along columns based on the column name provided.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when the key parameter is a string representing a column name, the function correctly uses the column name for grouping along columns.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(key, str):
        if key in group_axis:
            # Grouping along columns based on the column name
            key = obj[key]
        else:
            raise KeyError(key)

    # The rest of the function remains unchanged

    return BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated), exclusions, obj
```

By checking if the key is a string representing a column name and then using the corresponding column data for grouping along columns, we can address the bug and ensure that the groupby operation works as expected.

This correction should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test cases provided.
