The bug in the `_get_grouper` function seems to be related to the incorrect processing of the `key` parameter when provided as a string in combination with the `level` parameter. The code checks for the type of `group_axis` to handle the `level` parameter differently for `MultiIndex` and non-`MultiIndex` cases. However, there are inconsistencies in the conditional checks within these blocks. This inconsistency leads to errors when handling `key` as a string.

The bug occurs when the function is provided with a single string as the `key` value. It should interpret this as a column name, but due to the conditional blocks in the code, the handling is incorrect, leading to key errors during the execution of the function.

To fix this bug, we need to revise the conditional blocks related to handling the `key` and `level` parameters, especially when `group_axis` is a `MultiIndex`. We need to ensure that the function correctly processes the `key` parameter as a single key in the case of a non-`MultiIndex`, and as multiple keys when it is a `MultiIndex`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None

        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str) and level != group_axis.names:
                raise ValueError("level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level))
            elif not(-1 <= level <= 0):
                raise ValueError('Level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex')

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj

    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj

    is_tuple = isinstance(key, tuple)
    all_hashable = is_tuple and all(map(is_hashable, key))

    if is_tuple:
        if (all_hashable and key not in obj and set(key).issubset(obj)) or not all_hashable:
            msg = ('Interpreting tuple \'by\' as a list of keys, rather than '
                   'a single key. Use \'by=[...]\' instead of \'by=(...)\'...'
                   )

            warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
            key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # rest of the function remains the same
```

This corrected version ensures that the `key` parameter is correctly processed based on the type of `group_axis`, addresses the inconsistency in handling `level` and `key`, and resolves the key error issue reported in the GitHub bug.
