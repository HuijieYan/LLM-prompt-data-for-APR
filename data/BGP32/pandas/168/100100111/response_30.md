### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_grouper` is responsible for creating and returning a `BaseGrouper` object, which is an internal mapping for creating grouper indexers.
2. The issue seems to be related to the grouping behavior when using `groupby` with the `axis` parameter set to 1 to group by columns.
3. The failing test `test_groupby_axis_1` demonstrates the bug by showing that when trying to group by `x` along the columns axis, a `KeyError` is raised instead of successful grouping and summing.
4. The bug is caused by incorrect handling within the `_get_grouper` function of the `key` parameter when trying to group by columns. The function needs to properly address the case of grouping by columns.
5. To fix the bug, the function should be updated to correctly handle grouping by columns by ensuring that the key is interpreted as column labels if grouping by columns.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check the input parameters for the correct DataFrame, axis, and key values.
2. Update the function logic to properly handle the case of grouping by columns.
3. Modify the code to correctly interpret the key as column labels when grouping along the columns axis.
4. Test the corrected function against the failing test to ensure proper grouping and summation along the columns.

### Bug-fixed version of the function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Check if grouping along columns axis
    if key is not None and is_list_like(key) and axis == 1:
        key = [obj.columns.get_loc(k) if k in obj.columns else k for k in key]

    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        # Remaining function code remains the same...

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged...
```
In the bug-fixed version of the function, we address the issue by correctly interpreting the key as column labels when `axis` is set to 1 for grouping along columns. This change ensures that the function can handle grouping by columns as intended.
