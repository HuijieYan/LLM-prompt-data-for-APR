## Correction

### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_grouper` in `pandas/core/groupby/grouper.py` has an issue with handling the group keys passed along the axis. This issue is causing the test `test_groupby_axis_1` in `pandas/tests/groupby/test_groupby.py` to fail. The function fails to correctly extract the passed group keys and handle them as expected, resulting in incorrect groupings and leading to assertions failing in the test.

The bug occurs when the function is trying to group along the axis specified with keys as a list. The function fails to handle the case where the keys are a list during grouping.

### Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_get_grouper` function, we need to ensure that the function can handle group keys correctly when passed as a list along the specified axis. We should modify the logic to properly extract the group keys from the input parameters and create groupings accordingly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(level, (str, int)):
            level = [level]
        elif is_list_like(level):
            level = list(level)
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unsupported type for level")

    keys = [key] if not isinstance(key, list) else key
    levels = [level[0] if level else None for _ in range(len(keys))]

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for gpr, level in zip(keys, levels):
        in_axis, name = True, gpr
        exclusions.append(name)

        if is_categorical_dtype(gpr) and len(gpr) != obj.shape[axis]:
            raise ValueError("Length of grouper and axis must be of the same length")

        ping = Grouping(
            group_axis,
            gpr,
            obj=obj,
            name=name,
            level=level,
            sort=sort,
            observed=observed,
            in_axis=in_axis,
        )

        groupings.append(ping)

    if len(groupings) == 0 and len(obj):
        raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")

    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

### Justification:
- The corrected function now properly handles the keys passed as a list and extracts individual keys and levels for grouping.
- The function now correctly creates `Grouping` objects for each key and level combination.
- The function also checks and raises an error if the length of the grouper and axis is not the same.
- The `exclusions` list now correctly contains the names of the columns used for grouping.
- The corrected function should now pass the failing test `test_groupby_axis_1` and satisfy the expected input/output values provided in the cases.
- The logic is simplified to handle a list of keys and levels for creating the groupings along the specified axis.
