### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_grouper` is responsible for creating and returning a `BaseGrouper` object, which is an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
2. The function handles various scenarios based on the provided parameters like `obj`, `key`, `axis`, `level`, etc., to determine the groupings and exclusions to be used.
3. The bug seems to be related to processing the `key` parameter and handling it adequately to create the required Grouping objects.
4. The failing tests are related to grouping along columns with a specific key, which is causing the KeyError.
5. The issue on GitHub is related to a similar problem of GroupBy not offering implicit selection by column name when using `axis=1`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of the `key` parameter in scenarios where the `key` is a list. This results in a processing discrepancy and leads to a KeyError when grouping on columns.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the `key` parameter is correctly processed when it is a list.
2. Validate the key against the obj's columns before processing it to avoid KeyError.
3. Update the logic for handling list-like `level` and `key` to align with the expected behavior.
4. Improve the conditional checks to properly handle different types of keys.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            ...
    
    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        ...
    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        ...

    is_tuple = isinstance(key, tuple)
    all_hashable = is_tuple and is_hashable(key)

    if is_tuple:
        if (all_hashable and key not in obj and set(key).issubset(obj)) or not all_hashable:
            key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    any_callable = any(callable(g) or isinstance(g, dict) for g in keys)
    any_groupers = any(isinstance(g, Grouper) for g in keys)
    any_arraylike = any(
        isinstance(g, (list, tuple, Series, Index, np.ndarray)) for g in keys
    )

    if (
        not any_callable
        and not any_arraylike
        and not any_groupers
        and match_axis_length
        and level is None
    ):
        if isinstance(obj, DataFrame):
            all_in_columns_index = all(
                g in obj.columns or g in obj.index.names for g in keys
            )
        elif isinstance(obj, Series):
            all_in_columns_index = all(g in obj.index.names for g in keys)

        if not all_in_columns_index:
            keys = [com.asarray_tuplesafe(keys)]

    ...
```

By revising the handling of the `key` parameter and ensuring proper validation against the object's columns, this corrected version of the function should address the KeyError issue and align with the expected behavior for grouping along columns.
