## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_grouper()` is responsible for creating and returning a `BaseGrouper` object used for groupby operations in Pandas. The function processes various input parameters related to grouping, such as the key, axis, level, etc., to determine the appropriate grouping operation to apply.

The bug seems to be related to handling the `key` parameter when it is a list like `['x']` in the context of grouping by columns. The function fails to properly handle the case where the key is a list and does not process it correctly, leading to unexpected behavior and causing tests to fail.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the function encounters a key of a list type (e.g., `['x']`) for column grouping (axis=1). It does not properly handle this case, causing issues with the grouping process and failing the test cases provided in the GitHub issue.

The key causes the function to iterate incorrectly over the elements of the key, resulting in faulty processing of the grouping operation, leading to incorrect groupings and failing test cases. 

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function `_get_grouper()` needs adjustments in the handling of the key when it is provided as a list. Specifically, the function should correctly process and interpret the list of keys for column grouping to ensure that the grouping operation functions as intended.

The following steps can be taken to fix the bug:
1. Identify the specific block in the function where the key is parsed and processed for grouping.
2. Update the code to handle a list of keys correctly for column grouping by considering each element of the list individually.
3. Ensure that the function creates the appropriate Grouping objects based on the provided keys for column grouping.

By implementing these changes, the function should be able to correctly process a list of keys for column grouping and pass the failing test cases while addressing the issue reported on GitHub.

By making the changes outlined in the corrected version of the `_get_grouper()` function, the bug related to column grouping with a list of keys should be resolved, and the function should now handle such cases correctly, passing the failing test cases and addressing the GitHub issue.
