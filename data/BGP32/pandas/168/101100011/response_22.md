### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_grouper` in the `pandas/core/groupby/grouper.py` file is responsible for creating and returning a `BaseGrouper`.
2. The bug occurs when attempting to group along columns using the `groupby` function with `axis=1`.
3. The issue arises due to improper handling of column grouping when the `key` parameter is a string representing the column name.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the discrepancy in behavior when grouping by columns using column names.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the code not recognizing column names correctly for grouping along columns (`axis=1`). The function fails to properly handle the case when grouping is intended along columns specified by their names.
   
### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that column names are correctly recognized and processed for grouping along columns (`axis=1`). This involves updating the logic related to identifying and handling column names during the grouping process.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    ...
    # Existing Functionality
    
    # Validate that the passed single level is compatible with the passed axis of the object
    if level is not None:
        # Handle the case when grouping along columns using column names
        if not isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if isinstance(key, str) and obj.columns.name != key:
                raise ValueError("key name {} is not the name of the columns".format(key))
            level = None
            key = key  # Use the column name as the key for grouping
            
        ...

    # Updated Logic
    
    # New logic to handle grouping using column names directly
    if not isinstance(key, (Grouper, BaseGrouper, list)):
        if key in obj.columns:
            key = obj[key]  # Get the column values as key for grouping
            
    # Existing code continues as before ...
    
    ...            
```

By updating the `_get_grouper` function as shown above, we address the issue of incorrect handling of column names when grouping along columns (`axis=1`). The corrected version should now correctly recognize and process column names for grouping operations.
