### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_grouper` in the `grouper.py` file of the `groupby` module is responsible for creating a `BaseGrouper` object based on the input parameters like `key`, `axis`, `level`, etc.
2. The issue reported on GitHub points out that when using `groupby(by="x", axis=1)`, it raises a `KeyError` even though "x" is a column name.
3. The bug seems to be related to how the function processes the input `key` parameter when grouping by column names.
4. The conditional blocks checking for different types of inputs for `key` and handling them seem to be causing the issue.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of the `key` parameter when grouping by columns. Specifically, in the section where it checks for the type of `key` input and processes it accordingly, there are issues with the logic flow.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when grouping by column names, the function correctly handles the input `key` parameter and creates the `BaseGrouper` object accordingly. The logic to process column names should be adjusted to align with the intended functionality.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        ...
        # Code for handling level when group_axis is MultiIndex

    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        ...

    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        ...

    is_tuple = isinstance(key, tuple)
    all_hashable = is_tuple and is_hashable(key)

    if is_tuple:
        if (all_hashable and key not in obj and set(key).issubset(obj)) or not all_hashable:
            msg = (
                "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than "
                "a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In "
                "the future, a tuple will always mean a single key."
            )
            warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
            key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    any_callable = any(callable(g) or isinstance(g, dict) for g in keys)
    any_groupers = any(isinstance(g, Grouper) for g in keys)
    any_arraylike = any(
        isinstance(g, (list, tuple, Series, Index, np.ndarray)) for g in keys
    )
  
    # Updated logic for handling column names as keys when grouping by columns
    if all(not _is_label_like(g) for g in keys) and not any_callable and any_arraylike and match_axis_length and level is None:
        all_in_columns_index = all(g in obj.columns for g in keys)
        if not all_in_columns_index:
            keys = [com.asarray_tuplesafe(keys)]

    levels = [level] * len(keys)
    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    ...
    # Remaining part of the function remains unchanged
```

By updating the logic to properly handle the scenario where column names are used as keys for grouping by columns, the corrected function should now work as intended and pass the failing test.
