### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_grouper` is responsible for creating a `BaseGrouper` object that represents the internal grouping logic for the `groupby` operation in pandas. The issue seems to be related to handling the case when grouping is performed along columns using the `axis=1` argument.

### Error Location:
The bug in the `_get_grouper` function seems to be in the logic related to processing `key` and `group_axis` when grouping along columns.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug causes an error when attempting to group along columns (`axis=1`) where the code incorrectly handles column names and keys. This issue results in unexpected behavior when performing a `groupby` operation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
The bug can be fixed by adjusting the logic related to handling `key` and `group_axis` specifically for grouping along columns (`axis=1`). It is crucial to correctly process the column names and keys to ensure the `groupby` operation works as intended.

### Corrected Version of `_get_grouper`:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None and isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
        if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
            level = level[0]

        if key is None and is_scalar(level):
            key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
            level = None
    else:
        level, key = None, group_axis

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By updating the logic within the `_get_grouper` function as shown above, the bug related to incorrect handling of column names should be resolved. The corrected version improves the processing of keys and group_axis for grouping along columns (`axis=1`).

This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub regarding the problem with `groupby` not offering implicit selection by column name(s) and the `KeyError` raised when grouping along columns.
