### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_grouper` is responsible for creating a `BaseGrouper` object which is used internally for grouping operations. The issue reported in the GitHub post is related to the `groupby` function not correctly handling grouping along columns when using the `axis=1` parameter.

### Error Location:
The issue seems to be arising from the implementation of the `_get_grouper` function where the logic for handling grouping based on columns is not correctly implemented.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of column-based grouping in the `_get_grouper` function. The incorrect implementation causes a KeyError when attempting to group along columns while summing the values.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `_get_grouper` function related to column-based grouping. The function should correctly handle grouping along columns when the `axis=1` parameter is provided.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj

    if isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj

    if axis == 1 and is_list_like(key):
        # Handling grouping along columns correctly
        key = list(key)

    # The remaining logic remains the same

    ...
```

By modifying the code to correctly handle grouping along columns when `axis=1` is specified, we should be able to resolve the issue reported in the GitHub problem description.
