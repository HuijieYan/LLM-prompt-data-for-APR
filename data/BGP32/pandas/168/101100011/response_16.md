The bug in the `_get_grouper` function seems to be related to how the `level` parameter is handled, potentially causing errors when processing MultiIndex objects.

The cause of the bug may lie in the conditional checks for `isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex)` and the subsequent handling of the `level` parameter within those blocks. In particular, there are inconsistencies in the treatment of `level` for MultiIndex and non-MultiIndex cases. This could lead to incorrect processing of the `level` parameter, resulting in unexpected errors.

To fix the bug, we should ensure consistent handling of the `level` parameter for both MultiIndex and non-MultiIndex cases. Specifically, we need to adjust the conditional checks and the subsequent logic to properly handle the `level` parameter based on the type of `group_axis`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps

    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
        if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
            level = level[0]

        if key is None and is_scalar(level):
            # Get the level values from group_axis
            key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
            level = None
    else:
        # allow level to be a length-one list-like object
        if is_list_like(level):
            nlevels = len(level)
            if nlevels == 1:
                level = level[0]
            elif nlevels == 0:
                raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
            else:
                raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

        if isinstance(level, str):
            if obj.index.name != level:
                raise ValueError(
                    "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                )
        elif level is not None and (level > 0 or level < -1):
            raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

    # rest of the function remains unchanged

```

By making these adjustments to the handling of the `level` parameter, the function should now correctly process MultiIndex objects and prevent potential errors related to the processing of levels. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the corrected function passes the failing test case provided.
