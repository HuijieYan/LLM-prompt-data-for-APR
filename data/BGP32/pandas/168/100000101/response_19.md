After analyzing the buggy function and its expected input/output values, we can see that the bug arises due to the handling of the `key` parameter. Specifically, the issue lies in the code block where the type of `key` is checked and processed. The function incorrectly assumes that the `key` parameter is a scalar, which causes errors in the subsequent operations.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic related to the `key` parameter to handle both single values and iterable values correctly. We will modify the code to handle the `key` parameter appropriately for different cases, ensuring that the function works as expected for all input scenarios.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    is_tuple = isinstance(key, tuple)  # Check if the key is a tuple
    all_hashable = is_tuple and all(is_hashable(k) for k in key)

    # Handle tuple key
    if is_tuple:
        if len(key) == 1 and key[0] is not None:
            key = key[0]  # Unpack tuple with single value
        
        if all_hashable:  # Tuple contains hashable elements
            if key not in obj and set(key).issubset(obj):  # Check for subset
                keys = list(key)
            else:
                keys = [key]  # Single key
        else:  # Tuple contains unhashable elements
            msg = (
                "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than "
                "a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In "
                "the future, a tuple will always mean a single key."
            )
            warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
            keys = list(key)

    else:  # Not a tuple
        keys = [key] if not isinstance(key, list) else key  # Single key or list of keys

    match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # Continue with other parts of the function

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle the `key` parameter correctly for both single values and iterable values, ensuring that the function works as expected for all input scenarios outlined in the provided test cases.
