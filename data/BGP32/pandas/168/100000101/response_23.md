The bug in the provided function is in the handling of the `key` parameter when it is a list. The function is not iterating over the elements of the list correctly, leading to unexpected behavior. To fix this bug, we need to modify how the function handles list-like keys.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... function body as before ...

    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
        
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)
        
        any_callable = any(callable(g) or isinstance(g, dict) for g in keys)
        any_groupers = any(isinstance(g, Grouper) for g in keys)
        any_arraylike = any(
            isinstance(g, (list, tuple, Series, Index, np.ndarray)) for g in keys
        )
        
        if match_axis_length and not any_callable and not any_arraylike and not any_groupers:
            if isinstance(obj, DataFrame):
                all_in_columns_index = all(g in obj.columns or g in obj.index.names for g in keys)
            elif isinstance(obj, Series):
                all_in_columns_index = all(g in obj.index.names for g in keys)
                
            if not all_in_columns_index:
                keys = [com.asarray_tuplesafe(keys)]

    if isinstance(level, (tuple, list)):
        if key is None:
            keys = [None] * len(level)
        levels = level
    else:
        levels = [level] * len(keys)

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    # ... the rest of the function ...

```

By iterating correctly over the elements of the list-like key parameter, we ensure that each element is handled appropriately based on its type. This modification fixes the bug in the function.
