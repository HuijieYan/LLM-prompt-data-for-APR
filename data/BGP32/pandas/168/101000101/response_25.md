The bug in the `_get_grouper` function is related to the conversion of the `key` parameter to a list within the function logic. When a single string key is provided, it should be converted to a list with a single element. However, the current implementation does not handle this conversion correctly, leading to issues during execution.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the handling of the `key` parameter in the function. Specifically, we need to make sure that when a single key is provided as a string, it gets converted to a list with that single key as the only element.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None

        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj

    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj

    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        key = list(key)
        msg = (
            "Interpreting tuple 'key' as a list of keys, rather than "
            "a single key. Use 'key=[...]' instead of 'key=(...)'. In "
            "the future, a tuple will always mean a single key."
        )
        warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = key

    # rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

This corrected version ensures that when a single string key is provided, it gets converted into a list with that single key as the element. Other input parameters and internal logic remain intact to handle the different cases correctly.

After applying this fix, the `_get_grouper` function should work as expected for all the provided test cases.
