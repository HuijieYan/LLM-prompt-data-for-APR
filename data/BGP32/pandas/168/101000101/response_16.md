The buggy function is failing to correctly process the key parameter when it is a single string value. The function requires splitting the key into a list even if it's a single value. This bug leads to misinterpretation of the passed key parameter and incorrect processing down the line.

To fix this bug, we need to update the code so that when the key is not a list, it is converted into a list with the single value. This change will ensure that the function processes the key parameter correctly in all cases.

Here is the corrected version of the _get_grouper function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Rest of the code remains unchanged

    # convert key to list if it's not already
    if not isinstance(key, list):
        key = [key]

    # the rest of the function stays the same
```

By making this change, the function will be able to handle single string values correctly and process the key parameter in all situations as expected.
