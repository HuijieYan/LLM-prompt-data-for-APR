### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_grouper` is used to create and return a `BaseGrouper` object based on various parameters passed to the function. It processes the input data to determine the grouping for the grouper accurately.

The bug in the function seems to arise from the conditions related to the `MultiIndex` object in the input data. The conditions have some issues with handling the `level` parameter when it is a length-one list-like object. The logic for checking and setting the `level` and `key` variables seems to be incorrect and may lead to incorrect grouper creation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to review the conditions that handle the `level` parameter. Specifically, we need to ensure that the correct logic is applied for MultiIndex objects when setting the `level` and `key` variables.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
    values

    If validate, then check for key/level overlaps

    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            level = ensure_categorical(level)
            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if isinstance(level, (list, tuple)):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("Multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "Level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("Level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

    if isinstance(obj.index, MultiIndex) and level is not None:
        key = level
        level = None


    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

This corrected version adjusts the logic related to the `level` parameter to ensure correct handling in cases involving MultiIndex objects. It validates the level and key values appropriately before creating the `BaseGrouper` object.
