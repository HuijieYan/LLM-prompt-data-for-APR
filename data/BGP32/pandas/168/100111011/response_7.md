### Analysis:
1. The bug occurs when trying to group by column names using `df.groupby(by="x", axis=1).sum()` in the test function.
2. The error is a `KeyError` raised when the function encounters a column name as a key, which should not happen.
3. The bug is likely related to the handling of keys for column grouping.
4. To fix the bug, we should ensure that the function correctly interprets column names as keys for grouping without raising a `KeyError`.
5. By modifying the section of code related to processing key values for columns, we can resolve the issue.

### Bug Fix:
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function that should resolve the bug:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Processing keys for column grouping
    if key is not None and not isinstance(key, (Grouper, BaseGrouper)):
        keys = [key] if not isinstance(key, list) else key

        if not any(callable(g) or isinstance(g, dict) for g in keys):
            if all(g in obj.columns for g in keys):
                match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(obj.columns)

                if match_axis_length and level is None:
                    return BaseGrouper(
                        group_axis,
                        [Grouping(group_axis, obj[g], obj=obj, name=g, sort=sort, observed=observed, in_axis=True) for g in keys],
                        sort=sort,
                        mutated=mutated
                    ), [], obj

    # Remaining code remains unchanged

```

After applying this fix, the function should correctly group by column names when `df.groupby(by="x", axis=1).sum()` is called in the test function. The `KeyError` should no longer occur, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
