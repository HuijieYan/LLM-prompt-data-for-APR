### Bug Analysis:
1. The `_get_grouper` function is expecting a single key parameter, but in the failing test cases, it receives a list for the `key` parameter.
2. The code section handling the key being a tuple is not optimized to handle a list of keys.
3. The function raises a `KeyError` when the key is not found in the object, which causes the test to fail.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The failing test passes a list `['x']` for the `key` parameter, while the function expects a single key. This discrepancy causes the function to encounter issues when processing multiple keys.
2. The code related to handling tuple keys is inefficient when dealing with a list of keys, leading to improper handling and warnings being triggered.
3. The `KeyError` is raised when a key is not found in the object, erroneously causing a failure in the tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `_get_grouper` function to handle a list of keys properly.
2. Update the tuple key processing logic to be compatible with a list of keys.
3. Improve error handling when a key is not found to avoid triggering unnecessary exceptions.

### Bug-fixed version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(obj, key=None, axis=0, level=None, sort=True, observed=False, mutated=False, validate=True):
    # Check if the key is a list, if so, treat each key as individual grouper
    if isinstance(key, list):
        groupings = []
        exclusions = []
        
        for k in key:
            grouper, exclusion, obj = _get_grouper(obj, key=k, axis=axis, level=level, sort=sort, observed=observed, mutated=mutated, validate=False)
            groupings.append(grouper)
            exclusions.extend(exclusion)
        
        grouper = BaseGrouper(obj._get_axis(axis), groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, exclusions, obj
    
    # Existing logic for single key handling remains unchanged
    ...
    # The rest of the function remains the same
```

This updated version of the `_get_grouper` function now properly handles a list of keys, ensuring correct processing and avoiding the `KeyError` issue. After applying this fix, the failing test cases should pass successfully.
