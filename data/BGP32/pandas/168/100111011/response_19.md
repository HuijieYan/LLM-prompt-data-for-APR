The bug in the `_get_grouper` function arises from the incorrect processing of the `key` parameter when it's a single string. The function is not handling the case where the `key` parameter is a string properly, leading to a `KeyError` when trying to access this value.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the single string `key` is processed correctly and transformed into a list of keys. We can do this by modifying the logic within the function to correctly handle the case when `key` is a string. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Function logic remains the same, with added handling for single string key
    if isinstance(key, str):
        key = [key]

    # Rest of the function code as is...
```

This modification ensures that if the `key` parameter is a single string, it is converted into a list containing that string. This change should fix the bug and allow the function to correctly handle the case where the `key` parameter is a single string.
