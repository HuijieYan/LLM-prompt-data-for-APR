## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_get_grouper` function when handling the `key` parameter in the case where `key` is of type `list`. The code has a condition to check if `key` is not a list, and if it's not a list, it wraps it in a list. However, when `key` is already a list, this condition fails to account for it. This causes issues in the subsequent processing of the keys, leading to the `KeyError`.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the part of the code that processes the `key` parameter when it is already a list. We can ensure that it's a list before any further processing on keys. Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # previous code ...

    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
    else:
        keys = [key]
    
    # continue with the key processing logic...

    # the rest of the function remains unchanged
```

This modification ensures that even if `key` is already a list, it will still be properly processed as a list of keys. This change should resolve the `KeyError` issue with the `groupby` function on columns.

By making this adjustment, the `_get_grouper` function will handle the key parameter correctly and prevent the `KeyError` when the function is called with a list of keys.
