## Bug Fix Analysis

### Issue:
The bug occurs in the `_get_grouper` function when trying to group by column names using `df.groupby(by="x", axis=1).sum()`. The function fails to handle the case where the `key` parameter is a string or a list of strings representing column names. The code flow in `_get_grouper` does not correctly process the key when it is a string, leading to a `KeyError` being raised.

### Root Cause:
The issue arises from how the function distinguishes between grouping by index labels and grouping by column names. When dealing with columns, the function fails to properly recognize and process them, leading to the KeyError.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly identify that the `key` parameter represents column names and handle them appropriately for grouping. This involves ensuring that the function correctly recognizes and processes column names when passed as the grouping key.

Let's modify the code to correctly handle grouping by column names.

### Bug Fix Implementation:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
                
            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")
            
            if is_list_like(key):
                key = obj.columns.intersection(key).tolist()
                
            if isinstance(key, str):
                if key not in obj.columns:
                    raise KeyError(f"Column label '{key}' not found in columns")

    # Rest of the function remains the same...
```

### Bug Fix Explanation:
- Modified the function to treat column names appropriately when passed as the grouping key.
- If `key` is a string, it is checked if it exists in the columns of the DataFrame.
- If `key` is a list of strings, it filters out only the column names that exist in the DataFrame columns.
- This ensures that the function correctly identifies and processes column names for grouping when `axis=1`.
- The rest of the function remains unchanged to maintain the other functionalities intact. 

This fix addresses the bug by properly handling grouping by column names and prevents the `KeyError` that was raised previously.
