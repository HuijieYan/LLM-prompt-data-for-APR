## Bug Fix Strategy
The issue arises from the incorrect processing of the input parameter `key` when it is a list that contains a single element. The function wrongly interprets a single element list as the actual key to use for grouping. To fix this bug, we need to adjust the handling of the `key` parameter when it is a single-element list. The function should treat it as a list of keys rather than a single key.

## Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function that addresses the issue:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Case when the key is a single-element list
    if isinstance(key, list) and len(key) == 1:
        key = key[0]

    # Rest of the function logic stays the same ...

    # a passed-in Grouper, directly convert
    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged ...
```

By modifying the handling of the `key` parameter, we ensure that a single-element list is correctly processed as a list of keys. This change aligns with the expected behavior when grouping by columns using a list. This fix should resolve the KeyError issue encountered when grouping along columns with a single-element list as the key parameter.
