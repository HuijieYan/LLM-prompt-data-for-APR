The bug in the `_get_grouper` function seems to originate from the logic for handling a single level key and its interaction with a MultiIndex structure. In the provided code, there are conditional checks specific to handling cases where the `level` parameter is not None. However, the distinction between MultiIndex and single level index operations seems to have some discrepancies.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the section that deals with the `level` parameter and its interaction with the `key` and `group_axis`. Specifically, we need to ensure that the code correctly handles cases where `group_axis` is a MultiIndex and adapts the behavior accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("Multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError("Level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level))
            elif not (-1 <= level < group_axis.nlevels):
                raise ValueError("Invalid level specified")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by appropriately refining the logic for handling MultiIndex and single level index scenarios, ensuring that the correct operations are applied based on the data structure being processed.
