The bug in the provided function `_get_grouper` seems to be related to the handling of the `key` input parameter, specifically when it is a tuple. The function incorrectly interprets the tuple as a single key instead of a list of keys when it is not found in the index. This leads to unexpected behavior and causes the function to fail in certain scenarios.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic related to the handling of tuple keys. We should ensure that when a tuple key is provided and it is not found in the index, it is correctly interpreted as a list of keys. This involves proper validation and conversion to a list when necessary.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Rest of the function remains the same, only the tuple handling has been fixed

    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        if all_hashable(key) and key not in obj and set(key).issubset(obj):
            # column names ('a', 'b') -> ['a', 'b']
            # arrays like (a, b) -> [a, b]
            msg = (
                "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than "
                "a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In "
                "the future, a tuple will always mean a single key."
            )
            warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
            key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # The rest of the function remains unchanged
```

This corrected version ensures that tuple keys are properly handled and converted to a list when needed, avoiding the misinterpretation of keys and potential issues caused by this.
