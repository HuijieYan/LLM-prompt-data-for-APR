The bug in the `_get_grouper` function is caused by the check for `is_tuple` and subsequent conversion of `key` to a list when `is_tuple` is `True`. This conversion is unnecessary and leads to issues later in the function.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In Case 1, the value of `key` is a string `'x'`, which is not a tuple. Therefore, `is_tuple` is `False`, and the unnecessary conversion to a list occurs.
2. Since `key` was converted to a list unnecessarily, the subsequent logic that relies on `key` being a single key fails to function correctly, leading to incorrect behavior in the function.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, remove the unnecessary conversion of `key` to a list when `is_tuple` is `True`.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_grouper` Function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Existing code...

    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        if not all_hashable(key) or (key not in obj and set(key).issubset(obj)):
            msg = "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In the future, a tuple will always mean a single key."
            warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
        
    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # Existing code...

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

By making this change, the function will no longer unnecessarily convert the `key` to a list when it is a tuple, resolving the bug effectively.
