The bug in the `_get_grouper` function seems to be related to how the input `key` parameter is handled when it is a list. The function is not properly converting the list of keys into individual keys for further processing. This issue results in incorrect behavior and can lead to errors during the execution.

To fix this bug, you can modify the section of the code that handles the `key` parameter when it is a list. Specifically, we need to ensure that each element in the list is processed separately as an individual key. Once each key is processed independently, the function should be able to create the necessary Grouping objects correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # other code remains the same

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = key

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for i, (gpr, level) in enumerate(zip(keys, levels)):
        # existing code for handling individual keys

    # remaining code unchanged
```

By ensuring that the `key` parameter is correctly processed as a list of keys, the function should now be able to handle multiple keys properly and avoid errors related to this issue. This correction will improve the functionality and accuracy of the `_get_grouper` function.
