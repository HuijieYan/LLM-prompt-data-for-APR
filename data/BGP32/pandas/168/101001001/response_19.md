The bug in the `_get_grouper` function seems to stem from the way the `levels` and `keys` are processed when `level` is provided as a list. The function is not correctly handling the case where `level` is a list and is causing issues in the subsequent processing.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In the first case, `level` is a single value `'x'`, but due to incorrect processing, it gets wrapped in a list `[None]` in the `levels` variable leading to incorrect behavior.
2. In the second case, `level` is a list `['x']`, but the processing again transforms it to `[None]` in `levels` variable causing discrepancies.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `level` is a list, it should be directly assigned to the `levels` variable.
2. Modify the logic for handling cases where `level` is provided as a list to correctly assign it to `levels`.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_grouper` function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                    )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

    # remaining code ...
```

In the corrected version, the handling of `level` as a list has been improved to prevent unnecessary wrapping with `None`. This should address the bug where the processing of `level` was causing the unexpected behavior.
