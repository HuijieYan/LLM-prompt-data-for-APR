The bug in the `_get_grouper` function seems to be related to the incorrect handling of the `level` parameter when it is a single value (not a list) in the non-MultiIndex case. This leads to issues in extracting the key and level values correctly, resulting in erroneous behavior.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In the `if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex)` block, the function checks if the `level` parameter is a single value and tries to extract the key from the `group_axis` based on that value. However, this logic is not correctly mirrored in the else block for non-MultiIndex cases.
2. The handling of `level` as a single value and extracting the key from `group_axis` is missing in the else block for non-MultiIndex cases, leading to inconsistencies in processing.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to align the key extraction logic for the `level` parameter in both the MultiIndex and non-MultiIndex cases. Specifically, make sure that when `level` is a single value, extract the key from `group_axis` correctly. This will ensure consistent behavior across different scenarios.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_grouper` Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function after addressing the bug:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]

            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if is_scalar(level):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(f"level name {level} is not the name of the index")
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            key = group_axis

    # Rest of the function remains the same as the original

    # Ensure to maintain consistency in key extraction for both MultiIndex and non-MultiIndex cases
```

By ensuring proper extraction of the key when `level` is a single value, the corrected version should now handle the scenario correctly and avoid the bug that was present in the original implementation.
