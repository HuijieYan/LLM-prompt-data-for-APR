### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_get_grouper` function when handling the `key` parameter. In Case 1 and Case 2, the key is a single string `'x'` and a list `['x']` respectively. The issue arises when checking for the type of the key and processing it accordingly. The code contains logic to handle different types of keys, but it fails to properly identify the key type in certain cases, leading to incorrect processing and ultimately causing unexpected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key type is correctly identified and processed according to its type. Specifically, we need to address the handling of string keys and list keys. By correctly categorizing the key type and adjusting the subsequent logic accordingly, we can prevent the buggy behavior.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
                
            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("Multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if is_scalar(level):
                if obj.index.name != level:
                    raise ValueError(f"Level name '{level}' is not the name of the index")
            else:
                if level > 0 or level < -1:
                    raise ValueError("Level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    if isinstance(key, Grouper):
        binner, grouper, obj = key._get_grouper(obj, validate=False)
        if key.key is None:
            return grouper, [], obj
        else:
            return grouper, {key.key}, obj

    elif isinstance(key, BaseGrouper):
        return key, [], obj

    # Process differently based on the type of key
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        msg = ("Interpreting tuple 'key' as a list of keys, rather than a single key. "
               "Use 'key=[...]' instead of 'key=(...)'. In the future, a tuple will "
               "always mean a single key.")
        
        warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
        key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged

    # Return grouper, exclusions, and obj
    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In this corrected version, we have adjusted the handling of the `key` parameter to correctly identify its type and process it accordingly. This should prevent the bug from occurring and ensure the function works as intended in various scenarios.
