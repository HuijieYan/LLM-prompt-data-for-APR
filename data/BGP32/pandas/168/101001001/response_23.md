### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_grouper` function arises from the condition where the `key` parameter is a tuple. The function incorrectly interprets the tuple `key` as a single key instead of a list of keys. This leads to issues in handling the group keys and creating the `groupings`.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the section where a tuple `key` is encountered. We should treat the tuple `key` as a list of keys instead of a single key to ensure proper processing of the keys.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Previous code remains unchanged

    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        if key not in obj and set(key).issubset(obj):
            # Treat tuple key as a list of keys
            msg = (
                "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than "
                "a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In "
                "the future, a tuple will always mean a single key."
            )
            
            warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
            key = list(key)

    # Continue with the rest of the function

    # The rest of the function remains the same
```

This fix ensures that when a tuple `key` is encountered, it is correctly interpreted as a list of keys, addressing the bug in the original implementation.
