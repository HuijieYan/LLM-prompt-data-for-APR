### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_get_grouper` function arises due to the passed `key` parameter being converted to a list, but then in subsequent logic, the code expects `key` to be a single value, causing a KeyError when accessing the value as a string.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the `key` passed to the function is always a list, even if it contains only one element.
2. Update the logic to handle the case where `keys` should be a list, as indicated by the original conversion of `key` to a list.
3. Make sure that the `gpr` variable representing the grouping key is accessed correctly according to its modified structure as a list.

### Bug-fixed Function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Previous code remains unchanged until this point
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        # Interpret tuples as a list of keys
        msg = (
            "Interpreting tuple 'by' as a list of keys, rather than "
            "a single key. Use 'by=[...]' instead of 'by=(...)'. In "
            "the future, a tuple will always mean a single key."
        )
        warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning, stacklevel=5)
        key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
    else:
        keys = key

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged

    for i, (gpr, level) in enumerate(zip(keys, levels)):
        # Existing logic for processing each gpr

    # Remaining function code remains unchanged
```

After applying the bug fix, the `_get_grouper` function should handle the case where `key` is a list correctly, avoiding the KeyError issue seen in the failing tests that expect `key` to be accessed as a list.
