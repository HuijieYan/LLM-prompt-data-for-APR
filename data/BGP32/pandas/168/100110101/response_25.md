### Analysis
#### Bug
The bug in the `_get_grouper` function arises when the function is called with a list of keys for grouping, and it expects a single key instead.

#### Code Explanation
The `_get_grouper` function takes several parameters to create a `BaseGrouper` object for grouping. The `key` parameter is used for defining the key or keys to group by. However, the current implementation does not handle the case where `key` is passed as a list of keys properly.

#### Test Cases
1. In the first test case, the function is called with a single key `'x'`, but it fails because the output expects a list of keys instead of a single key.
2. In the second test case, the function is called with a single key `'x'`, but it fails for the same reason as in the first case.
3. In the third test case, the function is called with a single key `'x'`, but it expects a list of keys.
4. In the fourth test case, the function is called with a single key `'x'`, but it fails because the output expects a list of keys instead of a single key.
5. In the fifth test case, the function is called with a single key `'x'`, but it fails for the same reason as in the first case.
6. In the sixth test case, the function is called with a single key `'x'`, but it expects a list of keys.
7. In the seventh test case, the function is called with a single key `'x'`, but it expects a list of keys.
8. In the eighth test case, the function is called with a single key `'x'`, but it fails because the output expects a list of keys instead of a single key.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the section of the code that handles the `key` parameter. We should check if `key` is a list, and if it is, handle it accordingly to create the `BaseGrouper` object.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    ...
    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle multiple keys
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)
    else:
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
    ...
```

By adding a conditional check to handle the case where `key` is a list, we can ensure that the function works correctly for both single keys and lists of keys.
