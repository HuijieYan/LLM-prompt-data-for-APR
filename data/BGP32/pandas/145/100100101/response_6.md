The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function lies in the case when the right input is a Series and the axis is not specified as "columns". This can be observed in the failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting`, which aims to perform element-wise multiplication between a DataFrame and a Series of timedelta values. The expected output is a DataFrame where each column is multiplied by the corresponding value in the Series, treating NaT values correctly.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the handling of the case when the right input is a Series but the axis is not specified as "columns". We should modify the function to correctly operate on the rows in this case.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        if axis == "columns":
            assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        else:
            assert right.index.equals(left.index)
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)
    
    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this correction, the `dispatch_to_series` function should now properly handle the case when the right input is a Series and the axis is not specified as "columns", ensuring that the failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` passes as expected.
