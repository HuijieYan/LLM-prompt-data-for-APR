The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function arises from the way it handles the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series of `timedelta64` dtype containing NaT values. The bug leads to unexpected behavior when calling `df * ser` in the failing test case.

The bug causes the function to treat the NaT values as 'Not a Time' values similar to datetime values, resulting in unexpected output where the expected output should have NaT values. This issue occurs due to a mismatch in the handling of NaT values in the context of timedelta and datetime types.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `column_op` function to handle the operation between the DataFrame and Series with `timedelta64[ns]` dtype containing NaT values correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and right.dtype == "timedelta64[ns]":
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version includes a specific check for `timedelta64[ns]` dtype in the `elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries)` block. This check ensures that the function correctly handles NaT values when performing operations between the DataFrame and the Series.

By implementing this correction, the function should now pass the failing test case and provide the expected output with NaT values in the resulting DataFrame.
