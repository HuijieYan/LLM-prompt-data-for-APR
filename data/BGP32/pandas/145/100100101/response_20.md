The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function arises from the way it handles the case where `right` is a Series of type `timedelta64` and the `func` is an arithmetic operator. The function fails to properly handle this case, leading to incorrect results when such a scenario occurs.

The issue can be fixed by updating the `column_op` function to correctly handle the operation between a DataFrame column and a Series of type `timedelta64`. This can be achieved by checking the data type of the Series and applying the appropriate operation.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(a.shape[1])}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(a.shape[1])}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and right.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]':
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(a.shape[1])}

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version includes the necessary condition to handle the case where `right` is a Series of type `timedelta64`. By checking the dtype of the Series, the function now correctly applies the operation between DataFrame columns and the Series, resolving the bug identified in the failing test.
