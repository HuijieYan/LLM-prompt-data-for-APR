The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` fails in handling the case where the right input is a Series with datatype timedelta64 and the axis is set to 'columns'. This can be observed in the failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` where the function is called with a DataFrame and a Series of timedelta64 type.

The bug arises from the fact that the `column_op` function defined within the function does not handle the case where the right input is a Series with dtype timedelta64 and axis is set to 'columns'.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `column_op` function to appropriately handle this case so that the function can correctly evaluate the operation between the DataFrame and the Series.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
    
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this correction, the `dispatch_to_series` function should now be able to handle the case where the right input is a Series with dtype timedelta64 and axis is set to 'columns', passing the failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting`.
