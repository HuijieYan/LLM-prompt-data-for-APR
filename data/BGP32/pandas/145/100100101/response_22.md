The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is related to handling the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series with timedelta dtype. The bug causes unexpected behavior when performing the multiplication, leading to incorrect results.

## Bug Explanation:
When the function receives a Series with 'timedelta64[ns]' dtype and a DataFrame for multiplication, it fails to correctly handle the operation between the two data types. This results in a discrepancy between the expected and actual output, as observed in the failing test case.

The bug stems from how the function processes the operation between the DataFrame and the Series with timedelta dtype, causing the incorrect multiplication behavior.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `column_op` function within the `dispatch_to_series` function to handle the multiplication operation correctly.

## Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b).rename_axis(a.columns)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By updating the `column_op` function to correctly handle the timedelta dtype series multiplication with a DataFrame, this corrected version should pass the failing test case and provide the expected output.
