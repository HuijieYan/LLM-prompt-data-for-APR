The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` has an issue in the logic of creating `column_op` functions for different types of `right` inputs. The problematic part is when handling the case where `right` is an `ABCDataFrame`, the function is trying to access the columns of `b` and perform operations on them, which is incorrect.

### Bug Explanation:
When the `right` input is an instance of `ABCDataFrame`, the function should operate column-wise by comparing each column of `left` with the corresponding column of `right`. However, the current implementation incorrectly tries to access columns from `b` instead of `right`. This leads to a key error as the `b.iloc[:, i]` operation tries to access columns from a scalar `right` input.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the implementation of the `column_op` function for the case where `right` is an `ABCDataFrame`. We should directly compare columns of `left` with columns of `right` within the `column_op` function.

### Corrected Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this corrected version, the function should now correctly handle operations between a DataFrame and a Series containing timedelta data, resolving the bug you identified.
