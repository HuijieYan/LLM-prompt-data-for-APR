The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is related to how the function handles the input parameters `right` and `func` in the specific case of operating with a Series of timedelta64[ns] values. The function does not handle this case properly, leading to incorrect behavior when operating on DataFrames with timedelta values.

### Bug Explanation:
When the test case `test_td64_op_nat_casting` is executed, the function `dispatch_to_series` is called with a DataFrame `df` and a Series `ser` containing timedelta64[ns] values. The function fails to correctly handle the operation between the DataFrame and the Series, resulting in incorrect output.

The bug arises from the incomplete handling of operations involving timedelta values in the `dispatch_to_series` function. The function does not appropriately account for the case where the right operand is a Series of timedelta values with a `dtype` of 'timedelta64[ns]'. This leads to the buggy behavior observed in the failing test case.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function `dispatch_to_series` needs to be updated to properly handle operations involving timedelta64[ns] values. Specifically, it needs to correctly process the case where the `right` operand is a Series with timedelta values. This can be achieved by adjusting the logic for handling different types of operands in the function.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, (ABCSeries, Timedelta)) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, (ABCDatetimeIndex, ABCDatetimeArray, ABCTimedeltaArray)) and right.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]':
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By adding a specific check for timedelta related objects in the `elif` statement and adjusting the logic accordingly, the function can now correctly handle operations involving timedelta values. This correction should make the function behave as expected, passing the failing test case and ensuring the correct behavior for DataFrame arithmetic operations involving timedelta values.
