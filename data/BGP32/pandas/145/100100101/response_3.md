### Bug in the original function and Explanation:
The bug in the original `dispatch_to_series` function is in the handling of timedelta operations between a DataFrame and a Series containing timedelta values. The function fails to correctly perform the element-wise multiplication between the DataFrame and the Series due to a mistaken reference to the wrong dimensions.

Specifically, when handling the `ABCDataFrame` case, the function should multiply each element in the DataFrame with the corresponding element in the Series. However, the buggy implementation incorrectly tries to multiply the DataFrame column with the entire Series rather than element-wise multiplication.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `column_op` function properly performs element-wise operations between the DataFrame columns and the Series elements. This involves updating how the `b` variable (which represents the Series) is accessed within the `column_op` function.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By updating the `column_op` function to correctly handle element-wise operations between a DataFrame column and a Series element, the corrected function should now pass the failing test case.
