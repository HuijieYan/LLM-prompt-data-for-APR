The bug in the provided `dispatch_to_series` function is causing the test case `test_td64_op_nat_casting` to fail. The function fails to handle the case where the right input is a Series of type `timedelta64`. The bug leads to an incorrect evaluation of the operation resulting in a mismatch between the expected and actual output.

Based on the expected values and types provided, it seems that the issue lies in how the function handles the operation between the DataFrame and Series with timedelta data. The existing conditions in the function are not correctly identifying the type of the right input and its compatibility with the left DataFrame.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to properly handle the case when the right input is a Series with `timedelta64` data type. We should ensure that the column-wise operations are performed correctly taking into account the index and data type of the inputs.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        
        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        if right.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]':
            if axis == "columns" or right.index.equals(left.columns):
                data = {i: func(left.iloc[:, i], right) for i in range(len(left.columns))}
            else:
                data = {i: func(left.iloc[i], right.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(left))}
            new_data = pd.DataFrame(data)
            return new_data

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In this corrected version, we specifically handle the case where the right input is a Series with `timedelta64[ns]` data type and perform the column-wise operation considering the compatibility of indices and columns. This modification should ensure that the function works correctly for the failing test case provided.
