### Bug Explanation:
The error message states that there is an unsupported operand type for multiplication between a numpy array and `NaTType` (Not-a-Time). This error occurs when trying to perform element-wise multiplication between a DataFrame and a Series containing NaT values.

From the runtime values, we can see that the right parameter is a Series containing NaT values, which are being operated on the left DataFrame in a column-wise manner. This operation leads to the error because NaT values are not compatible with the arithmetic operation.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the right operand is a Series containing NaT values. We should exclude NaT values from the operation and only perform the operation on elements that are not NaT.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        if axis == "columns":
            assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
            # operate row-by-row excluding NaT values
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if b.iat[i] != pd.NaT else pd.NaT for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        else:
            assert right.index.equals(left.index)
            
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isna(b.iloc[i]) else pd.NaT for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version of the function checks for NaT values in the Series `right` and excludes them from the operation to avoid the unsupported operand type error.
