### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs due to the function trying to perform a multiplication operation between a DataFrame (`left`) and a Series (`right`) containing `NaT` values. The error message indicates that the operation is not supported between a `numpy.ndarray` and a `NaTType`.

The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` attempts to dispatch the operation to the `column_op` function based on the type of the `right` input. In this case, the `right` input is a Series containing `NaT` values and the function tries to apply the multiplication operation on each column of the DataFrame `left` with the `NaT` value.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the `right` input is a Series containing `NaT` values. We should modify the `column_op` function to skip performing the operation when the value in `right` is `NaT`. This will prevent the TypeError from occurring when trying to perform arithmetic operations involving `NaT`.

### Corrected Function
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns)) if not pd.isna(b.iloc[i])}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns)) if not pd.isna(b.values[0])}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
``` 

This corrected version of the function ensures that the `column_op` function does not attempt to perform arithmetic operations involving `NaT` values, preventing the TypeError from occurring.
