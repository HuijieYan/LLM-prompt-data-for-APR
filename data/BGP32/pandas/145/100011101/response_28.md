### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `dispatch_to_series` function is attempting to perform a multiplication operation between a DataFrame `left` and a Series `right`, where the `right` Series contains 'NaT' values. The error message indicates that the operation `op(a, b)` in the `_evaluate_standard` function fails due to unsupported operand types 'numpy.ndarray' (resulting from DataFrame) and 'NaTType' (resulting from Series).

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where one of the operands is 'NaT' appropriately. One approach is to check for 'NaT' values in the Series `right` before performing the operation. If a 'NaT' value is encountered, we need to handle the operation differently to avoid the TypeError.

### Corrected Function
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            values_b = b.values
            values_b[values_b == pd.NaT] = np.nan
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], values_b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By modifying the `column_op` function for the case where `right` is an ABCSeries, we can handle 'NaT' values appropriately before performing the operation. This should prevent the TypeError caused by attempting to multiply a 'NaT' value with a numpy array.
