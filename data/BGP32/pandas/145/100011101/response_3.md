### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs when trying to perform an arithmetic operation (multiplication) between a DataFrame and a Series containing timedelta values. The error is raised at the point where the operation is being evaluated due to an unsupported operand type for the operation between a numpy array and NaT (Not a Time) type.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The `dispatch_to_series` function receives a DataFrame (`left`), a scalar or DataFrame (`right`), a function (`func`) representing the arithmetic or comparison operation, a string representation (`str_rep`), and an `axis`.
2. The function attempts to perform the operation by iterating over the columns of the DataFrame and applying the function to each column with the `right` value.
3. In this case, the `right` value is a Series containing timedelta values, and when trying to perform the operation, the error is raised as numpy arrays do not support operations directly with NaT values.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle the operation between a DataFrame column and the NaT values in the Series appropriately. We can update the `column_op` function to handle this specific case by converting the `right` value elements to their corresponding numpy array representation before performing the operation.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            b_arr = np.asarray(b)  # Convert Series to numpy array
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b_arr) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

After applying this fix, the corrected function should handle the operation correctly between a DataFrame and a Series containing timedelta values, preventing the unsupported operand error.
