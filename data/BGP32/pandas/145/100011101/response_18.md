The error message indicates that there is an issue with performing the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing `NaT` values.

### Bug Explanation:
- The error occurs in the `na_arithmetic_op` function within the `expressions.py` file, specifically in the `_evaluate_standard` function where the multiplication operation is being applied to a `numpy.ndarray` and a `NaT` value.
- The issue arises because `numpy.ndarray` does not support the multiplication operation with a `NaT` value which leads to a `TypeError`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the operation involves a `numpy.ndarray` and a `NaT` value appropriately. One way to address this is to check for `NaT` values and handle them separately before performing the multiplication operation.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    # with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    def modified_func(x, y):
        if isinstance(x, np.ndarray) and np.any(pd.isna(y)):
            y[pd.isna(y)] = 0  # Replace NaT with 0 for the multiplication
            return func(x, y)
        return func(x, y)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right, op=modified_func)
    return new_data
```

By modifying the `dispatch_to_series` function to handle the case where `numpy.ndarray` and `NaT` values are involved in the operation, we can ensure that the multiplication operation works correctly without raising a `TypeError`.
