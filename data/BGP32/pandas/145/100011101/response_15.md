### Bug Analysis
The error message shows a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'`. This error occurs when the function tries to perform the multiplication operation between a NumPy array and NaT (Not-a-Time) value.

Looking at the runtime values and types of variables, we see that the `right` variable is a Series containing NaT values. When the function tries to perform the operation with the DataFrame `left`, the issue arises.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the right input is a Series containing NaT values appropriately to avoid the TypeError during the operation.

### Updated Corrected Function
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and right.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]':
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.values[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        raise TypeError(f"Unsupported operand: {right}")

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

Now, the corrected function handles the case where the `right` input is a Series containing NaT values by extracting the ndarray values from the Series before performing the operation with the DataFrame. This fix should resolve the issue and the function should now pass the failing test.
