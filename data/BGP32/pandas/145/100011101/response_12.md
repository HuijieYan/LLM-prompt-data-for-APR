### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs because the function `dispatch_to_series` is unable to handle the case where the right operand is `NaT` (not a time) and an arithmetic operation such as multiplication is performed between a DataFrame and a Series containing `NaT`.

### Bug Explanation
1. The function `dispatch_to_series` is called with a DataFrame `left`, a Series `right` containing `NaT`, and a multiplication operator.
2. The function determines that `right` is a Series and correctly identifies that the index of the Series does not equal the index of the DataFrame, entering the corresponding conditional block.
3. Inside the conditional block, the function attempts to perform the operation element-wise by iterating over the columns of the DataFrame and applying the operation between each column and the corresponding value in the Series.
4. However, when the operation encounters a value of `NaT` in the Series, a `TypeError` is raised as `NaT` is not a valid operand for arithmetic operations involving numpy arrays.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `column_op` function within the conditional block to handle the case where the right operand is `NaT`. We can achieve this by checking for `NaT` values in the Series and skipping the operation in such cases.

### Corrected Function
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
    
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {
                i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isna(b) else np.nan for i in range(len(a.columns))
            }
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {
                i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) if not pd.isna(b.iloc[i]) else np.nan for i in range(len(a.columns))
            }
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {
                i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if not pd.isna(b.iloc[i]) else np.nan for i in range(len(a.columns))
            }
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {
                i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isna(b) else np.nan for i in range(len(a.columns))
            }
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By adding checks for `NaT` values in the Series `right` inside the `column_op` function, we ensure that the operation is only performed on valid operands, preventing the `TypeError` when multiplying a DataFrame with a Series containing `NaT`.
