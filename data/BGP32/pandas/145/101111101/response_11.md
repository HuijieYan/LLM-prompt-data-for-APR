The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is related to handling operations between a DataFrame and a Series of timedelta values, specifically when the Series contains NaT (Not a Time) values. The current implementation does not correctly handle this situation, leading to a TypeError during evaluation.

To fix this issue, we need to adjust the logic within the `dispatch_to_series` function to properly handle the case where the right operand is a Series with NaT values.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        # Check if the right Series has timedelta64 dtype with NaT values
        if right.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]' and right.isnull().any():
            right = right.where(~right.isnull(), pd.Timedelta(0))  # Replace NaT with 0
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns)}
        
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by checking if the right Series has a `timedelta64[ns]` dtype and contains any NaT values. If NaT values are present, it replaces them with 0 to allow the operation to proceed without errors.

By implementing this fix, the `dispatch_to_series` function should now handle operations between a DataFrame and a Series of timedelta values, including cases where the Series contains NaT values.
