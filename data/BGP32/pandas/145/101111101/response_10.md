### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs when the function `dispatch_to_series` tries to perform arithmetic operations on a DataFrame and a Series containing NaT values. The bug arises because the function does not handle NaT values correctly when performing element-wise operations.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In the failing test, the DataFrame `df` is multiplied by the Series `ser` which contains NaT values. During the execution, the function tries to perform element-wise multiplication (`*`) between the DataFrame and the Series.
2. The `dispatch_to_series` function dispatches to the `column_op` function to perform the operation column-by-column.
3. The `column_op` function then attempts to perform the operation on each element of the columns, leading to a TypeError due to unsupported operand types ('numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType').

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the operation involves NaT values. We can modify the `column_op` function to check for NaT values and handle them appropriately. One approach is to use `np.where` to apply the operation element-wise while handling NaT values correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    # with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: np.where(b.isna(), np.nan, func(a.iloc[:, i], b)) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: np.where(b.iloc[:, i].isna(), np.nan, func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i])) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: np.where(b.iloc[i].isna(), np.nan, func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i])) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: np.where(b.isna(), np.nan, func(a.iloc[:, i], b)) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
``` 

After applying this fix, the function should be able to correctly handle operations involving NaT values while operating on DataFrames and Series.
