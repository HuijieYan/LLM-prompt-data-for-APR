### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function occurs because when `right` is a timedelta Series (`right.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]'`), the `column_op` function defined inside the `dispatch_to_series` function is not handling the timedelta Series correctly, leading to the error when trying to evaluate the expression.

The current implementation of the `column_op` function for timedelta Series is not creating the correct operation between the DataFrame column and the Series element. This results in a TypeError when the operation is being evaluated.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `column_op` function to properly handle the case where `right` is a timedelta Series. We need to modify the operation performed on each column of the DataFrame with the corresponding element from the Series.

### Corrected Version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By updating the `column_op` function for the case where `right` is a timedelta Series, the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function should now correctly handle the arithmetic operation for the failing test case.
