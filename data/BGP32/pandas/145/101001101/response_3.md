The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is designed to evaluate a binary operation between a DataFrame `left` and either a scalar or another DataFrame `right`, column-by-column. The function contains multiple conditional branches based on the type of `right`, utilizing different implementations of the `column_op` function to handle each case.

In the provided buggy function, there is a case where `right` is a Series and `axis` is set to `'columns'`. This case aims to perform the operation row-by-row where each row of the DataFrame `left` is operated with the corresponding row of the Series `right`.

The bug is caused by the implementation of the `column_op` function inside the conditional block for this particular case. The `column_op` function was incorrectly designed to loop over the columns of the DataFrame `a` and apply the operation with the entire Series `b` instead of row-wise operations.

To fix this bug, the `column_op` function in the case of a Series comparison with `'columns'` axis needs to be modified to conduct row-wise operations. Each row of the DataFrame `a` should be paired with the corresponding row of the Series `b` for the specified operation.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    
    # Define column_op based on the type of 'right' and 'axis'
    if isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a))}

    else:
        if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
            assert right._indexed_same(left)
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        
        elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
            assert right.index.equals(left.index)
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

        else:
            # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
            raise NotImplementedError(right)
    
    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this correction, the `column_op` function now correctly handles the row-wise comparison between DataFrame `left` and the Series `right` when the `axis` is set to `'columns'. This should resolve the bug and ensure that the function operates as intended for the specified case.
