The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function arises from treating the `right` parameter as a scalar or a DataFrame without correctly unpacking its values. In the provided buggy function, when `right` is passed in as a Series, it is not correctly converted to an array for further computation.

To fix this bug, we should convert the `right` Series to an array using the `np.array` function before using it in the operations. This will ensure that the values are accessible and can be operated upon as expected.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        right_arr = np.array(right)  # Convert right to an array for computation

        if isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
            assert right._indexed_same(left)

            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

        elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
            # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
            # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
            assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

        elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
            assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

        else:
            # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
            raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right_arr)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that the `right` parameter is correctly converted to an array before proceeding with the operations. This fix should resolve the issue and ensure that the function behaves as expected for all cases.
