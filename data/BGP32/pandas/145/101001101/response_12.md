The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function arises from the incorrect handling of the `right` variable, which could be a Series, DataFrame, scalar, or an unexpected type. The function attempts to perform operations on DataFrame columns based on the type of `right`, but it encounters an issue when handling a Series input.

The problem occurs when the input `right` is a Series and the `axis` parameter is not specified as "columns". In this case, the function should iterate over the DataFrame columns and apply the function `func` with the corresponding values from the Series without considering the rows of the Series. However, the implementation mistakenly tries to apply the function to rows of the Series as if they match the DataFrame's index.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the part of the code where a Series is the `right` input but the `axis` is not specified as "columns". We should adjust the iteration logic to loop over the columns of the DataFrame and apply the function to each column with the full Series as another argument.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and (axis == "columns" or axis is None): # Update condition to include axis=None
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the case where `right` is a Series, and the `axis` parameter is not specified as "columns". The corrected code ensures that the function applies the operation column-wise when necessary.
