The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function stems from the inconsistency between the expected behavior of the input parameters and the actual handling of the variables within the function. Specifically, the issue lies in the way the `right` variable is being processed based on its type.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly handle the different data types of the `right` variable. The provided implementation is assuming `right` is always a scalar or a DataFrame, which leads to incorrect processing when `right` is a Series.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)

    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, (ABCSeries, ABCDataFrame)):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version ensures that `right` can be either a scalar, a Series, or a DataFrame and handles each case appropriately in the `column_op` function.

By updating the function to check for instances of both `ABCSeries` and `ABCDataFrame` for the `right` variable, we ensure that the function can handle different types of input correctly.
