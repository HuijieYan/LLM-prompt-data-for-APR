The bug is likely in how the `right` input parameter is processed inside the function. It is being converted to a scalar value using `lib.item_from_zerodim(right)`, which might be causing issues when trying to perform operations on it later. To fix this bug, we need to handle the `right` parameter appropriately based on its type.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        # If right is a scalar, create a dictionary comprehension for each column in the left DataFrame
        new_data = {i: func(left.iloc[:, i], right) for i in range(len(left.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        new_data = {i: func(left.iloc[:, i], right.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(left.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        new_data = {i: func(left.iloc[:, i], right.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(left.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        new_data = {i: func(left.iloc[:, i], right) for i in range(len(left.columns))}

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    return expressions.evaluate(new_data, str_rep, left, right)
```

This corrected version ensures that the `right` parameter is appropriately handled based on its type and that operations are performed correctly. It addresses the potential bug present in the original code.
