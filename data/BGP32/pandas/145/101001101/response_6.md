The issue in the buggy function `dispatch_to_series` seems to be related to the assignment of the `right` variable before entering the conditional statements. The code converts `right` to a scalar using `lib.item_from_zerodim(right)`, which does not properly handle the case where `right` is a Series with timedelta values.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that `right` remains as a Series when it contains timedelta values. We can modify the code to directly check for timedelta values, and handle them appropriately without converting to a scalar.

Here is the corrected version of the function `dispatch_to_series`:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    if isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and right.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]':
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Default behavior for scalar or remaining cases
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In this corrected version, we directly check if `right` is a Series with a dtype of `timedelta64[ns]` and handle it appropriately without converting it to a scalar.

This fix should address the bug and ensure that the function behaves as expected for the provided test case. Let me know if you need further assistance.
