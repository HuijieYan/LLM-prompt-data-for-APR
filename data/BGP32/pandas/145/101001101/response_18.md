There is a bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function where the `right` argument is not being converted to an array correctly, leading to issues with subsequent operations.

The bug occurs in the conversion of `right` to an array in the `column_op` functions. The function `lib.item_from_zerodim(right)` is not correctly handling the conversion for Series inputs. As a result, when trying to operate on the data in the `column_op` functions, there is a mismatch in the data types, causing the function to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `right` argument is converted to an array appropriately for Series inputs. We can achieve this by modifying the way we handle the `right` argument in the `dispatch_to_series` function. Specifically, we should convert the Series to an array before passing it to the `column_op` functions.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        right_array = right.values  # Convert Series to array
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later
        right_array = right.values  # Convert Series to array
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right_array)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version ensures that the `right` argument is properly converted to an array before passing it to the `column_op` functions, fixing the bug in the function.
