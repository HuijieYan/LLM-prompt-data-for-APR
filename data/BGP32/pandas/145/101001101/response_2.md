The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function lies in how the `right` input is handled. The function is trying to iterate over the columns of the `left` DataFrame and perform the operation specified by the `func` parameter with the corresponding column of the `right` DataFrame or scalar.

The issue arises when `right` is a Series and `axis` is set to `'columns'`. In this case, the function should be operating row-by-row, but it incorrectly attempts to access the columns of the `right` Series, leading to a key error since a Series does not have columns.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic when `right` is a Series and `axis` is set to `'columns'`. We should iterate over the rows instead of columns.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # Operate row-by-row when right is a Series and axis is 'columns'
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This correction should handle the cases where `right` is a Series and the `axis` is set to `'columns'` correctly, iterating over rows instead of columns.
