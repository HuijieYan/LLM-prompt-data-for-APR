The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is related to how the operation between a DataFrame and a Series with dtype="timedelta64[ns]" is handled. The provided test case `test_td64_op_nat_casting` fails because the function does not correctly handle this scenario.

### Bug Cause:
When the input `right` is a Series with dtype="timedelta64[ns]" and the operation is to be applied column-wise (axis="columns"), the function should perform element-wise operation between each column of the DataFrame `left` and the corresponding element in the Series `right`. However, the current implementation does not handle this correctly, leading to the test failure.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the column_op function inside the dispatch_to_series function to correctly handle the case where `right` is a Series and the operation should be applied column-wise. We should iterate over the columns of the DataFrame `left` and perform element-wise operation with the corresponding element in the Series `right`. 

### Corrected Version of the `dispatch_to_series` Function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        if axis == "columns":
            assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        else:
            assert right.index.equals(left.index)
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

After applying this fix, the `test_td64_op_nat_casting` test should pass successfully.
