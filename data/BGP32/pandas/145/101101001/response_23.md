The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be related to how the columns are being operated on based on the type of the `right` parameter. 

In the failing test case provided, the function is being called with `right` as a Series containing NaT values and the `func` as the multiplication operator. The goal is to perform element-wise multiplication between the DataFrame `df` and the Series `ser`.

Here's the bug:
- The function defines different `column_op` functions based on the type of the `right` parameter, but in the case where `right` is a Series and `axis` is not specified, the `column_op` function does not handle the operation correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `column_op` function for the case when `right` is a Series and `axis` is not specified to correctly apply the operation element-wise.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        column_op = lambda a, b: {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        column_op = lambda a, b: {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        column_op = lambda a, b: {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        column_op = lambda a, b: {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this correction, the `column_op` function will correctly handle the element-wise operation between the DataFrame columns and the Series values, fixing the bug and allowing the failing test to pass.
