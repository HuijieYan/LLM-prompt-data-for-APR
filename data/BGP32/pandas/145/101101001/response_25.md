The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is related to how it handles the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series with `NaT` values. The issue arises when trying to apply the operation `func(a.iloc[:, i], b)` where `b` is a Series containing `NaT` values. This causes unexpected behavior in the computation.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic in the function to handle the case of `NaT` values appropriately. One way to do this is to check for `NaT` values in the Series `b` and replace them with `0` before performing the operation.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and (axis == "columns" or right.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]'):
        # Handle case where Series contains NaT values
        b_cleaned = b.where(b.notnull(), 0)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b_cleaned) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This adjusted version handles the case where the Series `b` contains `NaT` values by replacing them with `0` before performing the operation. This modification should address the bug and make the function work correctly with the failing test case you provided.
