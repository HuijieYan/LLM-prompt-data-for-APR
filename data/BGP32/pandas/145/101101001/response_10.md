The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function lies in the way it handles the case where `right` is a Series with `axis='columns'`. 

The calculation inside the function should iterate over the rows of the DataFrame and apply the function to each row of the DataFrame and the corresponding row of the Series. However, the current implementation incorrectly iterates over the columns of the DataFrame, which leads to the incorrect output.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the iteration inside the function to iterate over the rows of the DataFrame and Series. We should also make sure that the indices of the DataFrame and Series align properly before performing the operation.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[i, :], b) for i in range(len(a.index))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[i, :], b.iloc[i, :]) for i in range(len(a.index))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # Correct the iteration to go row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[i, :], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.index))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[i, :], b) for i in range(len(a.index))}

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By making these changes, the corrected function should now correctly handle the case where `right` is a Series with `axis='columns'` and pass the failing test provided.
