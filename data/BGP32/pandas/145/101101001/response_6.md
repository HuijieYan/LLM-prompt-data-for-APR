The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be related to how the `column_op` function is defined and used based on different conditions. The function is attempting to perform element-wise operations between a DataFrame and a Series of timedelta64 values, but it fails to handle the timedelta64 "NaT" values correctly.

To fix this issue, we need to adjust how the `column_op` function handles the special case of NaT values when performing element-wise multiplication between the DataFrame and the Series. NaT values represent missing or undefined values in datetime operations, and they should be treated differently than regular timedelta values to avoid unexpected behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas._libs import Timedelta, Timestamp, lib, ops as libops
from pandas.core.dtypes.generic import ABCDataFrame, ABCDatetimeArray, ABCDatetimeIndex, ABCExtensionArray, ABCIndexClass, ABCSeries, ABCTimedeltaArray, ABCTimedeltaIndex
import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns) if not pd.isna(b) else b)}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns) if not pd.isna(b.iloc[i]) else b.iloc[i])}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns) if not pd.isna(b.iloc[i]) else b.iloc[i])}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns) if not pd.isna(b) else b)}

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

The changes made in the corrected version include checking if the value from the Series is `NaT` with `pd.isna()` and appropriately handling this case in the `column_op` functions for different conditions.

By making these adjustments, the corrected function should now handle the element-wise operations between DataFrames and Series of timedelta64 values with "NaT" values correctly, passing the failing test provided.
