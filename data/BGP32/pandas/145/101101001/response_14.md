After analyzing the provided buggy function and the failing test case, it seems that the issue lies in the implementation of the `dispatch_to_series` function related to handling timedelta64 data type and performing element-wise multiplication between a DataFrame and a Series containing NaT values.

The problem arises from the way the function constructs the `new_data` by applying the function `func(a.iloc[:, i], b)` for each column of the DataFrame `a` and the Series `b`. In the case of timedelta64, when the Series `b` contains NaT values, the multiplication operation with NaT values causes unexpected behavior resulting in incorrect output.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the handling of the NaT values when processing the operation between the DataFrame and the Series. We can modify the `column_op` function to explicitly handle NaT values when performing the arithmetic operation.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            if pd.isna(b):
                return {i: b for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            else:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isna(b.iloc[i]) else b.iloc[i] for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By explicitly handling the NaT values in the `column_op` function, the corrected version ensures that the arithmetic operation between the DataFrame and the Series containing NaT values behaves as expected. This fix should make the failing test case `test_td64_op_nat_casting` pass successfully.
