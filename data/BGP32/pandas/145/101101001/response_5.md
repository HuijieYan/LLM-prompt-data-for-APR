### Bug Explanation
In the `dispatch_to_series` function, the implementation for handling operations where `right` is a `Series` and the `axis` is not "columns" is missing. As a result, when the test case `test_td64_op_nat_casting` is executed, the function fails to handle the case where `right` is a `Series` and `axis` is not "columns", leading to NotImplementedError being raised due to the missing implementation for such cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this issue, we need to implement a case for handling `right` as a `Series` and `axis` not equal to "columns" in the `dispatch_to_series` function. This implementation should process the arithmetic operation between the DataFrame columns and the Series row-wise.

### Corrected Version of the `dispatch_to_series` function
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif axis != "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
``` 

By adding the condition `elif axis != "columns"`, we can handle the case where `right` is a `Series` and `axis` is not "columns" by performing the operation row-wise as intended.
