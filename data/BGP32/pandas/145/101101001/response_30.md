The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function arises because the implementation for handling `timedelta64` dtype in the case of multiplication is not correctly mapping the operation to the columns of the DataFrame as expected.

### Cause of the bug:
- The function is trying to perform element-wise multiplication between a DataFrame and a Series with elements of `timedelta64[ns]` type.
- The custom `column_op` function defined inside the `dispatch_to_series` function is not correctly handling the case when the right input is a Series with `timedelta64[ns]` dtype.
- The `column_op` function should operate on each column of the DataFrame `a` and the Series `b`, but the current implementation is not handling this appropriately.

### Fix strategy:
- Modify the implementation of the `column_op` function to handle the multiplication operation between a DataFrame column and a corresponding Series element containing `timedelta64[ns]` values.
- Ensure that the element-wise operation is applied correctly to each column of the DataFrame and the matching column of the Series.

### Corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By updating the implementation of the `column_op` function to handle the element-wise operations correctly based on the input types, the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function should now correctly handle the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series with `timedelta64[ns]` dtype.
