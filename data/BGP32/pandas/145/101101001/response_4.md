## Bug Explanation
The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is failing when the input `right` is a Series with `dtype: timedelta64[ns]` and the `axis` is set to `'columns'`. The issue arises when trying to perform element-wise multiplication between a DataFrame `left` and the Series `right`.

The problem lies in the implementation within the `dispatch_to_series` function where different conditions are checked to determine the operation between `left` and `right`. In the provided test case, the combination of a DataFrame and a Series with `dtype: timedelta64[ns]` triggered the specific condition where the operation should be carried out column-wise. 

However, the current logic inside the `dispatch_to_series` function is not correctly handling this scenario, which results in incorrect processing and return values.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the column-wise operation handling for the case when `right` is a Series with `dtype: timedelta64[ns]`. The operation should iterate over columns of the DataFrame `left` and apply the function `func` element-wise between each column and the corresponding element in the Series.

Specifically, we need to modify the `column_op` function defined within the `dispatch_to_series` function to correctly handle this scenario.

## Bug-fixed version of the code

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this fix, the `column_op` function will correctly handle the column-wise operation with the provided Series `right` when the `axis` is set to `'columns'`.
