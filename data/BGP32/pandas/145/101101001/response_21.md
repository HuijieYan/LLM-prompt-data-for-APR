### Explanation:
The failing test is checking if the `dispatch_to_series` function correctly handles the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing timedelta values. The test expects the result to be a DataFrame with the same shape as the input DataFrame, where each column is multiplied by the corresponding timedelta value in the Series.

The bug in the current implementation lies in the `column_op` function definition within the `dispatch_to_series` function. The issue is with how the indexing is handled for the columns of the input DataFrame and the Series. The current implementation is looping through the columns using `iloc[:, i]`, but it should be indexing based on the column names, as the Series has explicit index values.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `column_op` function to use the DataFrame column names for indexing when operating with the Series.
2. Ensure that the calculation is done based on the corresponding column values from the DataFrame and the Series.

### Corrected Version of the buggy function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {col: func(a[col], b) for col in a.columns}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {col: func(a[col], b[col]) for col in a.columns}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {col: func(a[col], b) for col in a.columns}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {col: func(a[col], b) for col in a.columns}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

After applying this fix, the `dispatch_to_series` function should correctly handle the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series of timedelta values, as demonstrated in the failing test case provided.
