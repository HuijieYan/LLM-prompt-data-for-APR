### Analysis:
The provided buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is supposed to evaluate frame operations by dispatching to the Series implementation column-by-column. The function defines different column operations based on the type of the `right` input provided. However, there are multiple column_op functions defined within the same file which can cause confusion and potential errors. 

Looking at the failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting`, we see that the test involves multiplication of a DataFrame `df` with a Series `ser` of dtype `timedelta64[ns]`, where the Series contains "NaT" values. The expected output is a DataFrame where each column should contain the same "NaT" values as the Series.

### Bug:
The bug in the current implementation arises from how the multiplication operation is handled when the `right` input is a Series containing "NaT" values. The current implementation fails to correctly broadcast the "NaT" values across the columns of the DataFrame, resulting in an incorrect output.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the operation is correctly performed column-wise, taking into account the "NaT" values present in the Series input. We should modify the `column_op` function to handle the broadcast of "NaT" values to each column of the DataFrame.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    
    def column_op(a, b):
        # Broadcast "NaT" values from the Series to each column of the DataFrame
        return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isnat(b) else pd.NaT for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By updating the `column_op` function to correctly handle the broadcasting of "NaT" values and apply the operation column-wise, we can fix the bug and ensure the correct behavior when performing arithmetic operations involving a DataFrame and a Series containing "NaT" values.
