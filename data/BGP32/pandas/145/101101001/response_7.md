The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function arises from how the `column-op` function is defined and used within the different conditional branches. In the provided code snippet, the `column_op` function is redefined multiple times based on different conditions, leading to confusion and potential errors in the calculation.

One key issue is that the `column_op` function is redefined for various cases without a clear strategy for handling each case consistently. This leads to incorrect calculations in the subsequent steps.

To fix the bug, we need to refactor the `dispatch_to_series` function and the `column_op` function definitions to ensure consistent behavior across different cases and improve code readability.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this correction, the behavior of the `column_op` function is standardized across different cases to ensure consistent handling of calculations. This updated version should now pass the failing test mentioned.
