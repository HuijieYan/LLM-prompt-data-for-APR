The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function lies in how the function `column_op` is defined and used based on the type of the `right` input parameter. In the failing test case provided, the function fails due to the incorrect handling of the `right` parameter being a Series with `timedelta64[ns]` dtype.

The issue arises from the fact that the Series `right` is expected to be treated as a scalar, but the actual data type `timedelta64[ns]` causes the function `column_op` to handle it incorrectly when trying to perform element-wise operations.

To fix this bug, we need to update the implementation of the `dispatch_to_series` function to correctly handle the case where `right` is a Series with a `timedelta64[ns]` dtype.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and right.dtype == "timedelta64[ns]":
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        
        # Convert the Series to a DataFrame for element-wise operations 
        right_df = pd.DataFrame({k: right for k in left.columns})

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        
    else:
        # Handle remaining cases as before
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    if isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and right.dtype == "timedelta64[ns]":
        right = right_df
    
    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By adding a specific handling for the case where `right` is a Series with `timedelta64[ns]` dtype, we convert the Series to a DataFrame with the same structure as `left` for proper element-wise operations. This should fix the bug and make the failing test case pass.
