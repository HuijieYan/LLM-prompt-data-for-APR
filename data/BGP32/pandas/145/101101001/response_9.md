The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function lies in the way it handles the case when `right` is a Series with `axis="columns"`. 

Upon analyzing the failing test and the runtime values, we see that the test is trying to perform element-wise multiplication between a DataFrame `df` and a Series `ser` with `dtype="timedelta64[ns]"`. The expected output is a DataFrame with the same shape as `df`, where each element in the resulting DataFrame is the product of the corresponding element in `df` and `ser`.

The bug occurs because when `right` is a Series and `axis="columns"`, the function is trying to perform the operation column-wise on the DataFrame `left`, which is incorrect. Instead, it should operate element-wise between the Series and the DataFrame.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the implementation of the function when `right` is a Series and `axis="columns"`. We should modify the `column_op` function inside the conditional block to perform element-wise operations between the Series and DataFrame.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns)}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
``` 

By updating the `column_op` function to correctly handle element-wise operations, the corrected function should now pass the failing test.
