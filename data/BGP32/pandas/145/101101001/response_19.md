The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function arises from the incorrect handling of the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing timedelta values. The function is currently trying to perform the operation column-wise but should actually perform it row-wise in this specific case.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The function `dispatch_to_series` checks the type of the `right` input:
   - If it is a scalar or a zero-dimensional object, it creates a `column_op` function to handle the operation column-wise.
   - If it is a DataFrame, it creates a `column_op` function to handle the operation column-wise.
   - If it is a Series and `axis` is set to "columns", it creates a `column_op` function to handle the operation row-wise but does not correctly implement it.
   - If it is a Series, it creates a `column_op` function to handle the operation column-wise.
   
2. In the failing test case, when `right` is a Series of timedelta values and `axis` is set to "columns", the function incorrectly attempts to execute the operation column-wise instead of row-wise.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `dispatch_to_series` function to correctly handle the operation when `right` is a Series with `axis` set to "columns". We should modify the `column_op` function created in this case to perform the operation row-wise as intended.

### Corrected Version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.index))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By modifying the `column_op` function for the case where `right` is a Series and `axis` is set to "columns" to perform row-wise operations, we ensure that the function now correctly handles the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series of timedelta values in the failing test.
