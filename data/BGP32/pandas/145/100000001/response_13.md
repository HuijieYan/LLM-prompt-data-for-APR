After analyzing the buggy function `dispatch_to_series`, the potential error location is in the `column_op` function definitions, especially when handling different types of inputs like scalars, DataFrames, and Series. The bug causes incorrect behavior when processing different types of inputs, which may result in unexpected outputs or errors.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `column_op` function correctly handles different input types (scalars, DataFrames, and Series) and implements the operation for each column appropriately.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version:
1. We have updated the `column_op` functions to handle different types of inputs correctly.
2. For the case where `right` is a Series and `axis` is "columns", we modified the function to access elements directly from the Series, taking into account the column-wise operation.
3. We addressed the bug that caused incorrect behavior in the original implementation when processing different inputs.

This corrected version should now handle various input types properly and execute the required operations column-by-column effectively.
