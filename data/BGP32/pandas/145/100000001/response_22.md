### Analysis:
The `dispatch_to_series` function is designed to evaluate frame operation by column using the Series implementation. The function determines the type of input `right` and based on that, defines a `column_op` function to perform the operation on each column of the DataFrame. The result is then evaluated using `expressions.evaluate` and returned as a new DataFrame.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of different types of `right` inputs.
2. The construction of the `column_op` function based on the type of `right`.
3. Assert statements to ensure compatibility and validity of inputs.

### Bug Cause:
The bug appears to be because of the way the `column_op` function is constructed for different types of `right` inputs. In the original implementation, the function wrongly handles the case when `right` is an `ABCSeries` and `axis` is set as "columns". The construct should operate row-by-row in this specific case, but the current implementation attempts to operate column-wise.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the `column_op` function should be correctly defined based on the type of `right` as per the specific conditions. Specifically, when `right` is an `ABCSeries` and `axis` is "columns", the operation should be performed row-by-row. This requires adjusting the logic for defining `column_op` under this condition.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, the `column_op` function is adjusted for the case where `right` is an `ABCSeries` and `axis` is "columns" to correctly operate row-by-row instead of column-wise. This should fix the bug and ensure proper evaluation based on the input conditions.
