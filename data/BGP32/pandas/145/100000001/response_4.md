## Analysis:
The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is intended to evaluate frame operations by dispatching column-by-column to the Series implementation. The function takes in parameters `left` (a DataFrame), `right` (a scalar or DataFrame), `func` (arithmetic or comparison operator), `str_rep` (a string representation, default None), and `axis` (axis along which to perform the operation).

## Potential error locations:
1. The `column_op` function is defined within conditional blocks, which might lead to scope issues.
2. The `elif` condition checks for `ABCDataFrame` and may not handle all DataFrame types appropriately.
3. There are assertions for index equality that might raise errors if not satisfied.
4. The `NotImplementedError` is raised for unhandled cases.

## Bug Cause:
The buggy function has issues with defining the `column_op` function within conditional blocks, potentially causing scope problems. Additionally, the handling of different `right` types and the assertions for index equality may not cover all cases properly.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Define the `column_op` function outside the conditional blocks to ensure it is accessible.
2. Review the logic for handling different types of `right` and index equality assertions.
3. Use a more robust approach to dispatching operations to ensure all cases are properly handled.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    def column_op(a, b):
        return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        column_op = lambda a, b: {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        column_op = lambda a, b: {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, the `column_op` function is defined outside the conditional blocks to ensure its accessibility. The handling of different `right` types and index equality checks are retained, but the lambda function approach is used for `column_op` in specific cases. The bug-related issues are addressed to improve the function's robustness and correctness.
