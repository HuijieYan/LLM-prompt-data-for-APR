### Analysis:
The `dispatch_to_series` function is designed to evaluate frame operations by iterating column-by-column and dispatching to the Series implementation. The function takes in parameters `left` (DataFrame), `right` (scalar or DataFrame), `func` (arithmetic or comparison operator), `str_rep` (string representation), and `axis` (axis specification).

### Identified potential error locations:
1. The initial assignment of `right`: `right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)` might cause issues with scalar input.
2. The conditional checks for different types of `right` inputs could lead to incorrect branches being executed.
3. The column operation functions for different types of `right` inputs might have discrepancies.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug in the current function arises from potential issues with handling different types of `right` input such as scalars, DataFrames, and Series. Additionally, the column operations might not behave as intended, leading to incorrect results or errors.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the scalar input is handled correctly.
2. Refactor the conditional checks to properly identify the type of `right` input.
3. Adjust the column operation functions to align with the type of `right` input specified.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, the handling of different types of `right` inputs is improved, and the column operation functions are adjusted accordingly. This should help in resolving potential bugs and ensuring the function operates as intended.
