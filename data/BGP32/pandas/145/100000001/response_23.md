## Analysis:
The `dispatch_to_series` function is intended to evaluate frame operations by iterating column by column and dispatching to the Series implementation. It takes as input a DataFrame `left`, a scalar or DataFrame `right`, an arithmetic or comparison operator `func`, a string representation `str_rep`, and an axis.

## Bugs:
1. The `func` function is not applied correctly to the columns of the DataFrame.
2. There are inconsistencies in the handling of different types of `right` inputs.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect implementation of the `column_op` function, which is supposed to apply the `func` operation to the columns of the DataFrame. Additionally, the handling of different types of `right` inputs is not consistent, leading to potential errors.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `func` function is correctly applied to the DataFrame columns. We also need to streamline the handling of different types of `right` inputs to avoid inconsistencies.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Use iloc to access columns for compatibility with non-unique columns
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    else:
        # Handle remaining cases
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, the `column_op` function now directly applies the `func` function to the columns of the DataFrame according to the input type of `right`. Additionally, the handling of different types of `right` inputs is made more consistent to avoid potential errors.
