### Analysis:
The `dispatch_to_series` function is designed to evaluate frame operations by dispatching to the Series implementation. It takes parameters `left` (DataFrame), `right` (scalar or DataFrame), `func` (arithmetic or comparison operator), `str_rep` (string representation), and `axis`. The function aims to apply the operator `func` to each column of the DataFrame `left` with the corresponding column of `right` or to a scalar `right`.

### Identified Potential Error Locations:
1. The function `dispatch_to_series` is trying to check if `right` is a scalar or a DataFrame using `lib.is_scalar(right)` and `isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame)`. However, it fails to handle the case if `right` is a Series instead of a scalar or DataFrame, causing an assertion error during execution.

2. The implementation of handling a Series when `axis` is not "columns" or when the Series index does not match the DataFrame index is not correctly implemented, which can lead to incorrect output.

### Explanation of Bug:
The bug in the current implementation arises from improper handling of the `right` input when it is a Series. The function does not have the necessary logic to handle Series input in a comprehensive way based on the conditions specified in the code. This results in assertion errors and potentially incorrect results when applying the operation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling Series input based on the conditions provided in the function. Specifically, we need to ensure that the function properly handles Series input, checks for index compatibility, and applies the operator `func` correctly to the DataFrame columns with the corresponding Series data.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        if axis == "columns":
            assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        else:
            assert right.index.equals(left.index)
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version of the function, I added specific conditions to handle the scenarios when `right` is a Series. The function now checks for index compatibility between the DataFrame and the Series based on the value of `axis` and applies the operator `func` accordingly. This updated version should address the bug and provide the correct behavior for handling Series input in the function.
