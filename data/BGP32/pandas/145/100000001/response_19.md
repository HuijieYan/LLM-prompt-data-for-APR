### Analyzing the Buggy Function:

The `dispatch_to_series` function is designed to evaluate frame operations by dispatching to the Series implementation. It takes as input a left DataFrame, a right scalar or DataFrame, a function (arithmetic or comparison operator), a string representation (optional), and an axis value.

### Error Location:

The potential error in the buggy function could arise in the `if-elif-else` conditions where the type checks are performed for `right`. The conditions may not correctly identify the type of `right` and execute the corresponding logic.

### Cause of the Bug:

The bug in the function could occur if the type of `right` is not correctly identified within the conditional checks. This could lead to improper handling of different types of input data, resulting in unexpected behavior or errors.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the type checks for `right` are accurate and the corresponding logic inside each condition correctly handles the input data. Additionally, we need to ensure that the function executes the desired operation based on the type of the input `right`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)

    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In this corrected version, I have maintained the structure of the function and ensured that the type checks for `right` are accurate within the conditional blocks. This should help in resolving any potential bugs related to handling different types of input data.
