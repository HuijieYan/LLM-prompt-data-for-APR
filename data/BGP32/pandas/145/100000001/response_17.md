## Analysis:
The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is designed to evaluate frame operations by column, dispatching to the Series implementation. The function takes in parameters `left` (a DataFrame), `right` (a scalar or DataFrame), `func` (an arithmetic or comparison operator), `str_rep` (a string representing the operation), and `axis` (specifying the axis to operate on). It then performs the operation on each column and returns the result as a DataFrame.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of scalar values when checking with `lib.is_scalar(right)` or `np.ndim(right) == 0`.
2. Inconsistent handling of different input types (scalar, DataFrame, Series) in the `if-elif-else` blocks.
3. Potential issues with indexing and matching dimensions between left and right data structures.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the original function is in the conditions and handling of different types of `right` inputs. The function doesn't properly distinguish between scalar, DataFrame, and Series values, leading to incorrect results when performing the specified operations column-wise.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the conditions and handling of different types of `right` inputs to ensure proper dispatching to the Series implementation based on the input type. We also need to make sure that the dimensions and indexing of `left` and `right` are compatible for the operation.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
    
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        column_op = lambda a, b: {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        column_op = lambda a, b: {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        column_op = lambda a, b: {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        column_op = lambda a, b: {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, I have updated the conditions and lambda functions in the `if-elif-else` blocks to handle different types of `right` inputs appropriately. I have also ensured that the dimensions and indexing compatibility checks are maintained for proper operation evaluation column-by-column.
