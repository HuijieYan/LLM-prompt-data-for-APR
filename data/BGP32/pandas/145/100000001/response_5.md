## Analyzing the buggy function:
The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is designed to evaluate frame operations by operating column-by-column and dispatching to the Series implementation. The function takes in three main parameters: `left` (a DataFrame), `right` (either a scalar or a DataFrame), `func` (an arithmetic or comparison operator), along with optional parameters like `str_rep` and `axis`.

## Potential error locations:
1. The `column_op` function definitions within conditional blocks might not be properly handling the column-wise operations for different types of `right` input.
2. The assignment of `right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)` could introduce potential errors if `right` is not properly handled for scalar values.
3. The use of `expressions.evaluate()` could also potentially lead to errors if the `column_op` functions are not correctly implemented.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug in the function could arise from incorrect handling of different types of `right` inputs, especially when performing column-wise operations. If the `column_op` functions are not correctly defined for the different cases, it could lead to incorrect results or unexpected behavior during evaluation.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure proper handling of different types of `right` inputs in the `column_op` functions by checking their types and adjusting the operations accordingly.
2. Verify the implementation of the scalar case for `right` after `right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)` to handle scalar values correctly.
3. Double-check the usage of `expressions.evaluate()` to ensure the correct operations are performed within the `column_op` functions.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By ensuring the proper handling of different types of `right` inputs in the `column_op` functions and addressing potential error locations, the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function should now be more robust and accurate in evaluating frame operations in pandas.
