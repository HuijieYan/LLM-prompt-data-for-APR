### Analysis:
The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is intended to evaluate a frame operation by applying an arithmetic or comparison operator column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation. The function takes a DataFrame `left`, a scalar or DataFrame `right`, an operator function `func`, a string representation `str_rep`, and an axis indicator.

### Bug Identification:
1. The use of `lib.ops.item_from_zerodim(right)` and `libops.is_scalar(right)` is incorrect as they should be called from `libops` module, but they are imported as `lib` and `libops` respectively.
2. The condition to check if `right` is a scalar or a 0-dimensional array may cause issues as it compares using `np.ndim(right) == 0`.
3. The way column operations are defined within the function seems to be inconsistent depending on the types of `right` and `left`.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug stems from incorrect imports and potential inconsistencies in column operation definitions based on the type of `right` provided to the function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Use the correct imports from the `libops` module.
2. Refactor the conditions and column operation definitions to ensure proper handling of different data types within the function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Use the correct imports for lib and libops
    right = libops.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if libops.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def row_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[i], b) for i in range(len(a))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def row_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[i], b) for i in range(len(a))}

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    if axis == 0:
        new_data = expressions.evaluate(row_op, str_rep, left, right)
    else:
        new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)

    return new_data
``` 

In the corrected version, the imports have been fixed and the functions for row operations and column operations have been differentiated based on the provided `axis`. Additionally, the condition for handling scalars has been improved for better clarity and correctness.
