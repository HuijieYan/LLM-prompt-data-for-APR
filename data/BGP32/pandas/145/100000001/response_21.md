### Analyzing the buggy function:
The `dispatch_to_series` function is designed to evaluate frame operations by dispatching to the Series implementation. It receives inputs `left` (a DataFrame), `right` (a scalar or DataFrame), `func` (arithmetic or comparison operator), `str_rep` (string representation, default None), and `axis` (axis for evaluation). The function creates column operations based on the type of `right` and executes them using `expressions.evaluate`.

### Potential error locations:
1. The function has multiple nested `if...elif...else` conditions based on the type of `right`. 
2. The implementation of column operations inside each condition may not be handling the input types correctly.
3. There could be issues with the `expressions.evaluate` call.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug might arise from incorrect handling of the `right` input type in the various conditions within the function. It's also possible that the column operations are not structured correctly for different input types, leading to errors during evaluation.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check each condition to ensure correct handling of the `right` input type.
2. Update the column operation logic to account for different input types.
3. Verify that the `expressions.evaluate` call is receiving the correct arguments.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        column_op = lambda a, b: {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        column_op = lambda a, b: {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        column_op = lambda a, b: {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        column_op = lambda a, b: {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, lambdas are used to define the `column_op` functions based on the type of `right`, allowing for easier handling of the column operations. Additionally, the function has been simplified and streamlined to ensure better readability and maintainability.
