1. Analyze the buggy function:
The function `dispatch_to_series` is designed to handle operations between a DataFrame and a scalar or another DataFrame. It dispatches the operation column-by-column, leveraging the Series implementation. The function aims to evaluate the operation using the provided `func` function. However, there seems to be a bug in how the function is handling different types of `right` inputs.

2. Identify potential error locations within the buggy function:
The potential error lies in how the function is trying to handle different types of `right` inputs, especially when it is a scalar or another DataFrame.

3. Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function:
The bug occurs when the input `right` is a scalar (`lib.is_scalar(right) == True`) or has zero dimensions (`np.ndim(right) == 0`). In these cases, the function tries to call `func(a.iloc[:, i], b)` which would not work since `b` is a scalar but should be broadcasted across the columns of `a`. This results in a `ValueError` when trying to perform operations between a DataFrame and a scalar.

4. Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `right` is a scalar separately and correctly broadcast it across the columns of the DataFrame `left`.

5. Corrected version of the function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        right = [right] * len(left.columns)  # Broadcast scalar to match columns of left

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, when `right` is a scalar or has zero dimensions, we now correctly broadcast the scalar to match the number of columns in the DataFrame `left`. This ensures that the operation can be performed across all columns of the DataFrame without raising any errors.
