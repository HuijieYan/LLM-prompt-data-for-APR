## Analysis:
The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` takes in two arguments (`left` and `right`), along with other optional parameters. It then performs an operation (`func`) column-by-column on the `left` DataFrame and the `right` input. The function dispatches to different implementations based on the type of the `right` input.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The implementation of `column_op` functions for different types of `right` inputs may have issues.
2. Error handling and assertions for certain cases might not be correct, leading to unexpected behavior.
3. The call to `expressions.evaluate()` could be problematic if `column_op` functions are not properly implemented.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the function could be related to incorrect behavior when the function encounters cases with non-unique columns or unexpected input types. The implementation of `column_op` functions for different scenarios might not be handling the cases appropriately, leading to errors or unexpected output.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Review the implementation of `column_op` functions for each case and ensure they correctly handle the input and perform the required operation.
2. Check the assertions and error handling to make sure they are appropriate for each scenario.
3. Verify that the call to `expressions.evaluate()` is passing the correct arguments and that the `column_op` functions are compatible with this evaluation.

## Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError("Unsupported input type for 'right'")

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In this corrected version, the `column_op` functions are adjusted to handle the different scenarios correctly, and the error handling is improved to raise a `NotImplementedError` for unsupported input types. The function should now behave as intended and handle various input cases appropriately.
