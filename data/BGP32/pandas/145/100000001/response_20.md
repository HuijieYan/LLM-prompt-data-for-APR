#### Analysis:
The `dispatch_to_series` function is designed to evaluate operations between a DataFrame and a scalar or another DataFrame by column-wise dispatching to the Series implementation. The function checks the type of `right` input and then performs the operation accordingly.

#### Bug Location:
The bug seems to be located in the `column_op` function definitions where the mapping is intended to be created for column-wise operations.

#### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by a mismatch in array indices when performing the column-wise operation. In the original implementation, the mapping is created for each column, but the operation should be done on the corresponding columns of the left and right data structures.

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the column-wise operation correctly performs the operation based on column index from both left and right data structures. This can be achieved by iterating over the indices of the columns of both left and right data structures simultaneously or ensuring that the columns match when performing the operation.

#### Corrected Version:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # Ensure that the columns from both left and right data structures match
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.loc[a.columns[i]]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version of the function, the `column_op` functions have been adjusted to ensure that the operations are performed correctly based on the columns of both left and right data structures. Specifically, in the case of a Series with `"columns"` axis, the corresponding columns are matched to perform the operation.
