The potential error in the buggy function lies in the column_op function where the logic for handling different types of input (DataFrame, Series, scalar) might not be correctly implemented. This can result in incorrect output or raise errors during execution.

The bug in the function is that when handling the case where the right input is an ABCSeries and axis is not specified as "columns", it should operate column-wise rather than row-wise. However, the current implementation operates row-wise in this case, which is incorrect.

To fix this bug, we should modify the column_op function to correctly handle the case where the right input is an ABCSeries and axis is not "columns". In this case, we should iterate over rows and apply the function element-wise to each element in the row.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In this corrected version, I have updated the column_op function for handling the case when the right input is an ABCSeries and axis is not "columns". The function now iterates over rows and applies the function element-wise to each element in the row, thus ensuring correct behavior for the operation.
