After analyzing the buggy function `dispatch_to_series`, the potential error locations are:
1. The way `right` is reassigned with `lib.item_from_zerodim(right)` might cause issues with scalar values.
2. The different conditions for `right` being a scalar, DataFrame, or Series might not cover all possible cases.
3. The implementation of `column_op` functions might not handle all scenarios correctly.

The cause of the bug in the function is that it does not handle all possible types for the `right` parameter and may lead to errors or incorrect results when performing operations.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to:
1. Ensure that the reassignment of `right` is done correctly for different types of inputs.
2. Cover all cases for the type of `right` parameter and implement appropriate logic in `column_op` functions.
3. Handle all possible scenarios and ensure that the operation is applied correctly column-by-column or row-by-row based on the input types.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function considering the potential error locations mentioned above:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    # with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        right_scalar = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], right_scalar) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version addresses the potential error locations and ensures that different types of inputs for the `right` parameter are handled correctly when performing operations column-by-column.
