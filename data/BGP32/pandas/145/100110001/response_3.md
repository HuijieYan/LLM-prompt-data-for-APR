### Analysis:
The error occurs when the `dispatch_to_series` function is called with a DataFrame and a Series containing `NaT` values, and the `__mul__` operation is performed. The error message indicates that there is an unsupported operand type for multiplication involving a numpy array and `NaTType`.

### Error Cause:
The bug arises from the way the operation is handled by the `column_op` function within the `dispatch_to_series` function. When attempting to perform element-wise multiplication between an array and `NaT`, the operations are not correctly handled, leading to a TypeError.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic within the `column_op` function to handle operations involving `NaT` values more robustly.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if b[i] != pd.NaT else pd.NaT for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By adding a conditional check in the `column_op` function to handle the case where the Series `b` contains `NaT` values, we ensure that the operation between the DataFrame and Series proceeds correctly, and the bug is fixed.
