### Analysis:
The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is responsible for evaluating frame operations between a DataFrame and either a scalar or another DataFrame. The failing test involves performing arithmetic operations between a DataFrame and a Series containing timedelta values. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to unsupported operand types (`numpy.ndarray` and `NaTType`) during multiplication (`*`).

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the `dispatch_to_series` function is not handling the case where the right operand (`b`) is of type `NaT` (Not a Time) correctly. The `column_op` function is trying to perform element-wise arithmetic operations between the DataFrame columns and `NaT`, which is not supported, leading to the `TypeError`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `column_op` function to handle the case when the right operand is `NaT` appropriately. Since arithmetic operations with `NaT` should result in `NaT`, we need to introduce a check for `NaT` and replace it with the appropriate value based on the operation being performed.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    # with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    
    def column_op(a, b):
        if pd.isna(b):
            return {i: b for i in range(len(a.columns))}  # Return NaT for operations with NaT
        return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this corrected version, the `column_op` function now properly handles the case of operating with `NaT` values, returning `NaT` in the resulting DataFrame if the right operand is `NaT`. This modification ensures compatibility when performing arithmetic operations between a DataFrame and a Series containing `NaT` values, resolving the `TypeError` reported in the failing test.
