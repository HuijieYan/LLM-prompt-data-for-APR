### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` in the pandas library is failing to handle the `Timedelta` type with NaT value correctly in the test case provided.
2. The error message indicates a `TypeError` when attempting the multiplication operation involving an ndarray and `NaTType`.
3. The issue is seen in the `column_op` function within the `dispatch_to_series` function which is supposed to handle the operation for each column in the DataFrame.
4. The bug arises due to the inability to handle the multiplication operation when one of the operands is `NaT`.

### Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `column_op` function within the `dispatch_to_series` function to handle the operation correctly when one of the operands is `NaT`. We can modify the logic to check for `NaT` values and skip the operation in such cases. 

### Corrected Version:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            result = {}
            for i in range(len(a.columns)):
                # Handle the case when one of the operands is NaT
                if pd.isnull(b):  # Check for NaT
                    result[i] = b
                else:
                    result[i] = func(a.iloc[:, i], b)
            return result

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

After applying this fix, the `dispatch_to_series` function should now be able to handle the case where one of the operands in the DataFrame operation is `NaT`. This fix should resolve the `TypeError` encountered in the failing test case provided.
