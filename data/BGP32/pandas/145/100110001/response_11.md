## Analysis:
1. The `dispatch_to_series` function is intended to evaluate frame operations by dispatching to the Series implementation column-by-column.
2. The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` is trying to perform a multiplication operation between a DataFrame `df` and a Series `ser`, where the Series contains timedeltas.
3. The error message shows a `TypeError` indicating that unsupported operand types are being used for the * (multiplication) operation.
4. The issue lies within the `column_op` function definition, specifically in cases where the right operand is a scalar or a DataFrame. The current implementation does not handle scalars or DataFrames properly when they contain timedelta data.
5. To fix the bug, we need to update the `column_op` function to correctly handle scalar or DataFrame operands with timedelta data.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `column_op` function to handle scalar or DataFrame operands more effectively.
2. Perform the multiplication operation between DataFrames and timedeltas only on compatible elements.
3. Ensure that the `column_op` function can correctly apply the arithmetic operation based on the type of the operands.

## Corrected Version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    # with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By updating the `column_op` function to handle scalar or DataFrame operands correctly, the corrected version should now handle the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing timedeltas without raising a `TypeError`.
