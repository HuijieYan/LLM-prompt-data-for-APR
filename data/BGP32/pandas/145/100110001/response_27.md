### Analysis:
1. The `dispatch_to_series` function is responsible for evaluating frame operations by dispatching to the Series implementation column-by-column.
2. The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` is trying to multiply a DataFrame by a Series containing NaT values, which results in an error due to unsupported operand types.
3. The error message indicates that the issue lies in the `evaluate` function, specifically in the `_evaluate_standard` method where the multiplication operation is failing due to mismatched operand types.
4. The bug occurs because the `left` operand is an np.ndarray containing integer values, and the `right` operand contains NaT values which are incompatible for multiplication.
5. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when the right operand contains NaT values and perform the operation only on non-null elements.

### Solution:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            # Handle the case when right contains NaT values by operating only on non-null elements
            mask = ~b.isna()
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i][mask], b[mask]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
``` 

By adding the handling for NaT values in the `ABCDataFrame` case when the right operand is a `Series`, the bug causing the multiplication issue with NaT values is resolved.
