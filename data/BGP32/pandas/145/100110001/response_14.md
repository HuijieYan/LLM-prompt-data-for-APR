### Analysis:
1. The `dispatch_to_series` function is responsible for evaluating operations on DataFrame columns or Series objects.
2. The failing test is trying to perform an operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing `NaT` values (Not a Time).
3. The error message indicates that the issue arises from attempting the multiplication operation between `numpy.ndarray` and `NaTType`, which is not supported.
4. The error likely originates from the `column_op` function used within `dispatch_to_series`, which fails to handle the case where `NaT` values are involved in the operation.
5. We need to modify the implementation of `column_op` to handle the `NaT` values appropriately.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `column_op` function in `dispatch_to_series` not handling the case where it needs to operate on columns with `NaT` values present. This leads to an unsupported operation between `numpy.ndarray` and `NaTType` when performing element-wise multiplication.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Check for `NaT` values in the column operations.
2. Handle operations involving `NaT` values appropriately by skipping them or replacing them with a valid value before performing the operation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            if isinstance(b, Timedelta) and b.isna():
                # Skip operation when encountering NaT values
                return {i: b for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            else:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            if b.isna().all():
                # Skip operation when all elements are NaT
                return {i: b for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            if b.isna():
                # Skip operation when encountering NaT values
                return {i: b for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By modifying the `column_op` functions to handle `NaT` values appropriately by skipping the operation or setting the values to `NaT` when encountered, we can fix the bug and enable the `dispatch_to_series` function to handle operations involving `NaT` values without throwing errors.
