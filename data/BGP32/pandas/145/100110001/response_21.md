### Analysis:
The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` is attempting to multiply a DataFrame by a Series containing timedeltas, specifically with values of "NaT" (Not a Time). When this operation is performed, it triggers the `dispatch_to_series` function, which then calls `expressions.evaluate` to perform the arithmetic operation. 

The error message hints at a `TypeError` related to `unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'`, indicating that the multiplication operation (`*`) is not supported between a NumPy array and a `NaTType` object.

### Bug:
The issue lies in the handling of timedeltas with "NaT" values in the `dispatch_to_series` function. When the left operand is a DataFrame and the right operand is a Series with "NaT" values, the function does not properly handle this scenario, resulting in the TypeError during the evaluation of the expression.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to update the `column_op` function in the `dispatch_to_series` function to handle the multiplication operation correctly when the right operand is a Series containing "NaT" values.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    # with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            if isinstance(b, (Timestamp, Timedelta)):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], pd.to_timedelta(b)) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            else:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

### Reasoning Behind the Fix:
In the corrected version, when the right operand is a Series in the `column_op` function, we explicitly check if the elements in that Series are of type `Timestamp` or `Timedelta` before performing the operation involving "NaT" values. If the operand is a `Timestamp` or `Timedelta`, we convert it to a timedelta value using `pd.to_timedelta` before performing the operation. This ensures that the multiplication operation is handled correctly even when "NaT" values are present.

By making this adjustment, the corrected function should now handle the scenario where a DataFrame is multiplied by a Series containing "NaT" values. This modification should resolve the TypeError reported in the failing test.
