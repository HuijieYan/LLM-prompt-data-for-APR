### Analysis:
- The failing test is trying to perform element-wise multiplication between a DataFrame and a Series containing timedelta values, specifically "NaT" values.
- The error message indicates that the operation fails due to an unsupported operand type for multiplication when encountering a combination of an ndarray and NaTType.
- The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is responsible for dispatching operations between a DataFrame and another data structure, in this case, a Series, for element-wise evaluation.

### Bug:
- The bug occurs when the operation encounters "NaT" values in the Series during the element-wise multiplication with the DataFrame.
- The error arises from the handling of this particular case insufficiency in the `dispatch_to_series` function, leading to the unsupported operand type error.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- We need to enhance the handling of the case where the operation involves "NaT" values in the Series while combining with the DataFrame.
- Specifically, we should check for "NaT" values and handle them appropriately to avoid generating the unsupported operand type error.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if pd.notna(b.iloc[i]) else b.iloc[i] for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

### Changes Made:
- Modified the `column_op` function for handling the case where NaN values ("NaT") are encountered in the Series `right`.
- The function now explicitly checks for NaN values and replaces the result with NaN instead of trying to operate directly.

By making this adjustment, the corrected function should now be able to handle the operation involving "NaT" values successfully, resolving the unsupported operand type error encountered in the failing test.
