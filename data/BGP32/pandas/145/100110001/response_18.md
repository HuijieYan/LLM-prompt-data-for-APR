### Analysis:
1. The `dispatch_to_series` function is intended to evaluate frame operations by dispatching to the Series implementation.
2. The error message indicates a `TypeError` occurring due to an unsupported operation involving a numpy array and a `NaTType`.
3. The failing test involves multiplication of a DataFrame by a Series containing `NaT` values, leading to the error.
4. The bug seems to be in the `column_op` function within the `dispatch_to_series` function, where it tries to perform an operation involving a numpy array and a `NaT` value, causing the `TypeError`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing `NaT` values. In the `column_op` function, the multiplication operation is carried out directly, resulting in an unsupported operation between a numpy array and a `NaT` value.

### Solution:
To fix this bug, we need to handle the operation involving a numpy array and a `NaT` value in a way that is supported. One approach is to check for the presence of `NaT` values before performing the operation.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns)) if not pd.isna(b.iloc[i])}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns)) if not pd.isna(b)}

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By checking for `NaT` values (`pd.isna`) before performing the operation involving numpy arrays and `NaT`, we ensure that the operation is only carried out when it is supported.
