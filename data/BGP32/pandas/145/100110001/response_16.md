### Analysis:
1. The `dispatch_to_series` function in `pandas/core/ops/__init__.py` is responsible for evaluating arithmetic operations between a DataFrame and another data structure (like a scalar, DataFrame, or Series) by performing the operation column-by-column.
2. The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` in `pandas/tests/frame/test_arithmetic.py` is trying to perform element-wise multiplication between a DataFrame and a Series containing 'NaT' values.
3. The error message indicates that the `dispatch_to_series` function runs into a TypeError due to unsupported operand types for the multiplication operation ('numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'). This occurs in the `na_arithmetic_op` function while evaluating the expression.
4. The bug arises because when attempting the multiplication operation, it's encountering 'NaT' values in the Series which are not handled correctly during the calculation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the 'NaT' values properly during the arithmetic operation within the `dispatch_to_series` function. Specifically, when performing element-wise multiplication, the operation should skip the 'NaT' values to avoid the TypeError.

### Corrected Version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if not pd.isna(b.iloc[i]) else b.iloc[i] for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isna(b) else b for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By modifying the `column_op` functions to handle 'NaT' values appropriately during the arithmetic operation, we can ensure that the TypeError is avoided when trying to multiply a DataFrame with a Series containing 'NaT'. This fix should allow the corrected version of the function to pass the failing test successfully.
