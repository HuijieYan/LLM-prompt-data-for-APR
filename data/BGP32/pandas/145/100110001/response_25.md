### Analysis:
1. The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` in the `test_arithmetic.py` file encounters an error when trying to perform an operation (`*`) between a DataFrame and a Series containing timedeltas.
2. The error message indicates that the operands involved in the operation are not compatible (`'numpy.ndarray'` and `'NaTType'`), leading to a `TypeError`.
3. The error occurs in the `na_arithmetic_op` function within the `array_ops.py` module, specifically when trying to perform the operation between the numpy array and `NaTType`.
4. The issue is likely related to how missing values (`NaT`) are handled alongside numpy arrays within the operation.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises because the implementation does not handle the case of performing operations between numpy arrays and `NaT` values. The code fails to correctly check for the compatibility of operands in this scenario, leading to a `TypeError`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the handling of missing values (`NaT`) while performing operations. We should handle the case where one of the operands is `NaT` in a way that prevents the `TypeError` from occurring.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if not pd.isnat(b.iloc[i]) else b.iloc[i] for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isnat(b) else b for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By incorporating the check for `NaT` values in the operation involving Series and DataFrames containing timedeltas, we can prevent the `TypeError` and ensure that the corrected function handles the operation correctly.
