The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function stems from the incorrect handling of the `right` operand when it is a scalar or a DataFrame in the case when `lib.is_scalar(right)` returns True.

The bug causes incorrect processing of the input, leading to unexpected behavior and failing test cases.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `column_op` function for the case when `lib.is_scalar(right)` is True. In this case, we need to handle the scalar value correctly for each column by broadcasting the scalar value to match the shape of the DataFrame.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

        # Broadcasting the scalar value to match the shape of the DataFrame
        right_broadcasted = pd.Series([right] * len(left), index=left.index)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

        right_broadcasted = right

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

        right_broadcasted = right

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

        right_broadcasted = right

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right_broadcasted)
    return new_data
```

After applying this fix, the `dispatch_to_series` function should now correctly handle operations with scalar values, and the failing test should pass successfully.
