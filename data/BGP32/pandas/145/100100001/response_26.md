## Analysis:
The `dispatch_to_series` function is designed to dispatch DataFrame operations column-by-column to the Series implementation. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles timedelta64(NaT) values when performing arithmetic operations.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The code segment that handles the case when `right` is a scalar or DataFrame.
2. The code segment that handles the case when `right` is an instance of ABCSeries and the axis is "columns".

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs when the `dispatch_to_series` function encounters a timedelta64(NaT) value in the Series `ser` while performing arithmetic operations with the DataFrame `df`. The function doesn't handle this case correctly, resulting in unexpected behavior.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `dispatch_to_series` function correctly handles timedelta64(NaT) values without treating them as datetime64 values. This can be achieved by adjusting the code segments responsible for handling scalar/DataFrame and Series instances with the "columns" axis.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            if isinstance(b, Timedelta) and pd.isna(b):
                return {i: b for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            else:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By checking if the right-hand operand `b` is a `Timedelta` and represents NaT, we ensure that timedelta64(NaT) values are treated appropriately in the arithmetic operations. This correction should address the bug and allow the failing test case to pass successfully.
