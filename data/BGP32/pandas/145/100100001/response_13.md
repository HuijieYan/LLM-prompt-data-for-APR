### Analysis:
The `dispatch_to_series` function handles different cases based on the type of `right` input. The buggy function fails to properly handle the case where `right` is a scalar or 0-dimensional array. This leads to incorrect behavior and causes the failing test case to produce unexpected results.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the incorrect implementation of `column_op` for the case when `right` is a scalar or 0-dimensional array. The function does not handle this case correctly, leading to unexpected outputs in the failing test.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `column_op` function for the case when `right` is a scalar or 0-dimensional array. We should modify this part of the code to correctly apply the arithmetic operation between the DataFrame columns and the scalar value.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

After applying this corrected version of the function, the failing test case should now pass without any issues.
