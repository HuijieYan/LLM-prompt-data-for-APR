## Analysis:
The `dispatch_to_series` function is designed to evaluate frame operations by processing column-by-column and dispatching to the Series implementation. The function checks the type of the `right` argument and then defines a `column_op` function accordingly to apply the operation.

## Error Location:
The bug seems to be located in the section where the function defines `column_op` when the `right` argument is an instance of `ABCSeries` and the `axis` parameter is not equal to "columns". In this case, the function should operate row-by-row, but the current implementation is still processing the data column-by-column.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because when the `right` argument is an instance of `ABCSeries` and the `axis` is not "columns", the function incorrectly treats the data column-wise instead of row-wise. This leads to incorrect results and fails the test case provided.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `column_op` function when the `right` argument is an instance of `ABCSeries` and the `axis` is not "columns" to operate row-by-row instead of column-by-column.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------

    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        if axis == 0 or axis == "index":
            # Operate row-by-row when axis is 0 or "index"
            assert right.index.equals(left.index)
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[i], b) for i in range(len(a))}
        else:
            assert right.index.equals(left.index)
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
``` 

By implementing the correct row-wise operation for `ABCSeries` when `axis` is 0 or "index", the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
