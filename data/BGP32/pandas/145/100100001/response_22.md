## Analysis:
1. The `dispatch_to_series` function is designed to handle different types of inputs `right` and perform column-wise operations on a DataFrame `left`.
2. The function has conditional branches based on the type of `right` input, checking for scalars, DataFrames, and Series.
3. The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` involves performing multiplication (`*`) operation between a DataFrame and a Series with "timedelta64[ns]" dtype.
4. The bug may be related to how timedelta data type is handled in the function, leading to incorrect casting or operation behavior.

## Bug:
The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is that it does not handle the timedelta data type properly, especially when performing operations between a DataFrame and a Series with timedelta dtype. This leads to incorrect casting or behavior, causing the failing test.

## Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to enhance the handling of timedelta data type in the function by checking for timedelta objects in the conditional branches and performing the operations accordingly.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            if isinstance(b.dtype, ABCTimedelta) or isinstance(b.dtype, ABCTimedeltaIndex):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], pd.to_timedelta(b)) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            else:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version includes a specific check for timedelta data type in the Series branch of the function, ensuring proper handling and avoiding the error encountered in the failing test.
