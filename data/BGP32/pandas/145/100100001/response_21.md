## Analysis:
The `dispatch_to_series` function is responsible for evaluating frame operations by dispatching to the Series implementation. The function handles different cases based on the type of `right` input and the `axis` parameter. However, the bug seems to be related to how the function handles `timedelta` data type.

## Bug Explanation:
The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` is designed to check if timedelta64 NaN values (`NaT`) are correctly handled in DataFrame arithmetic. The test creates a DataFrame (`df`) with numerical values and a Series (`ser`) with two `NaT` values of `timedelta64[ns]` data type. It performs element-wise multiplication between the DataFrame and the Series using the `*` operator and expects the result to have `NaT` values in both columns.

The bug occurs within the `dispatch_to_series` function, specifically in the `elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries)` block where it processes the Series data. The bug causes the function to treat `NaT` values as regular values, resulting in incorrect arithmetic operations.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the behavior of the `dispatch_to_series` function when handling `timedelta` data type (`ABCExtensionArray`). We should add a separate condition to properly handle `ABCExtensionArray` instances, particularly cases where `right` is a `timedelta` Series.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and isinstance(right.array, ABCTimedeltaArray):  # Handle timedelta series
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By adding the condition `elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and isinstance(right.array, ABCTimedeltaArray):`, we specifically handle the `timedelta` Series case and correctly process the arithmetic operations involving `NaT` values. This corrected version should address the bug and make the `dispatch_to_series` function compatible with the failing test.
