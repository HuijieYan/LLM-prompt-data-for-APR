### Analysis:
The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is used to evaluate frame operation using column-by-column processing. The bug seems to be related to the handling of different data types (specifically `timedelta64`) within the function.

### Potential Error Location:
The error might be occurring in the section where the function handles `timedelta64` data type, as indicated by the failing test related to `timedelta64` operation.

### Bug Cause:
The current implementation of the function does not properly handle the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series of `timedelta64` data type, causing the error in the failing test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the function to handle the multiplication operation between DataFrame and Series of `timedelta64` type appropriately. This involves ensuring that the operation is processed correctly and the result is as expected.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        if isinstance(right.dtype, ABCTimedeltaArray):
            right = pd.to_timedelta(right)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

The corrected version includes a conversion to timedelta for Series of `timedelta64` type before performing the operation with the DataFrame, ensuring correct processing for timedelta data.
