The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function lies in the implementation of the `column_op` function inside the main function. The issue is that the function `column_op` is redefined multiple times with different behavior based on the type of the `right` input, which causes a conflict in the function definition.

To fix this bug, we need to refactor the `column_op` function to handle different types of inputs outside of the `dispatch_to_series` function. By doing this, we can maintain a single definition of the `column_op` function and pass it to the `dispatch_to_series` function for evaluation.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function with the `column_op` function moved outside and defined only once:

```python
# Define the column_op function to handle different types of inputs
def column_op(a, b):
    return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        pass
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In this corrected version, the `column_op` function is defined only once outside of `dispatch_to_series` and is used consistently within the function. This change ensures that there is no conflict in function definitions based on different types of inputs, thereby fixing the bug in the original implementation of the function.
