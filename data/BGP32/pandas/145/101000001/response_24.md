The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function lies in the way the `column_op` function is defined and called based on the type of the `right` input. The current implementation tries to define the `column_op` function multiple times based on different conditions, leading to conflicts and potential errors.

To fix the bug:
1. We can define the `column_op` function once with a conditional structure inside it to handle different cases based on the type of `right`.
2. Use the defined `column_op` function inside the `dispatch_to_series` function to ensure uniform behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            if isinstance(b, ABCDataFrame):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            elif isinstance(b, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            elif isinstance(b, ABCSeries):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version:
- The `column_op` function is defined once with a conditional structure inside it to handle different cases based on the type of `right`.
- The `column_op` function is used as the argument for `expressions.evaluate` to evaluate the operation column-by-column.

By restructuring the logic within the `column_op` function and using it properly in the `dispatch_to_series` function, we have fixed the bug and ensured consistent behavior based on the type of `right`.
