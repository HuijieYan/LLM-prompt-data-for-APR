The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function lies in the way the `column_op` function is defined based on the conditions. The issue arises from the fact that the `column_op` function is redefined multiple times within the scope of the `dispatch_to_series` function, which causes conflicts and ambiguity.

To fix this bug, we need to refactor the `column_op` function to be defined only once outside the `dispatch_to_series` function. Then, we can use conditional statements within `dispatch_to_series` to determine which version of `column_op` to use based on the input parameters.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
# Define the column_op function only once outside the dispatch_to_series function
def column_op(a, b, func):
    return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        new_column_op = lambda a, b: column_op(a, b, func)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        new_column_op = lambda a, b: column_op(a, b, func)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        new_column_op = lambda a, b: column_op(a, b, func)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later
        new_column_op = lambda a, b: column_op(a, b, func)

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(new_column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In this corrected version, the `column_op` function is defined only once outside the `dispatch_to_series` function, and the appropriate version of `column_op` is assigned based on the conditions within the `dispatch_to_series` function before being used for evaluation.
