The bug in the provided function is within the series-wise operation dispatching logic. The issue arises because the function does not correctly handle the case when `right` is a scalar or a 0-dimensional array.

The bug causes the function to incorrectly operate column-wise rather than row-wise when `right` is a scalar. This results in unexpected behavior and incorrect output in certain scenarios.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic of the function to handle the scalar case appropriately by performing row-wise operations. The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def row_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[i, :], b) for i in range(len(a))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def row_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[i, :], b) for i in range(len(a))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    if "row_op" in locals():
	    new_data = expressions.evaluate(row_op, str_rep, left, right)
    else:
        new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
        
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version of the function:
- For the scalar case, we define a `row_op` function to perform row-wise operations, iterating over the rows of the DataFrame `left`.
- We then evaluate the appropriate function (`row_op` for scalar case, `column_op` for DataFrame cases) using the `expressions.evaluate` function to get the desired output.

These modifications ensure that row-wise operations are correctly handled when `right` is a scalar or a 0-dimensional array.
