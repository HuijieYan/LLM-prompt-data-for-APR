The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function lies in the way the `column_op` function is defined within different conditional blocks. The bug occurs because the `column_op` function is redefined multiple times with different implementations based on the conditions. This leads to a situation where the `column_op` function might not be properly defined when it is actually used in the final `new_data` assignment.

To fix the bug:
- Define the `column_op` function outside of the conditional blocks.
- Modify the implementation of `column_op` to handle different types of inputs.
- Pass the required parameters to the `column_op` function when it is used.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function with these changes:

```python
def column_op(a, b, func):
    return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        pass

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(lambda a, b: column_op(a, b, func), str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In this corrected version, the `column_op` function is defined outside of the conditional blocks. It takes `a`, `b`, and `func` as arguments and performs the desired operations. The lambda function passed to `expressions.evaluate` ensures that `column_op` is called with the correct arguments based on the conditions.
