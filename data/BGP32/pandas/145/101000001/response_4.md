## Analyzing the buggy function and related functions:

1. The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is responsible for performing frame operation by evaluating column-by-column and dispatching to the Series implementation.
2. The function relies on the helper function `expressions.evaluate` from the `pandas.core.computation.expressions` module to evaluate the column operation.
3. The `column_op` helper functions within `dispatch_to_series` are designed to handle different data types (DataFrame, Series, scalar) and perform the specific operation accordingly.
4. The bug might exist in the implementation of the `column_op` functions where the wrong operation is being performed or where the logic is incorrect.
  
## Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. Incorrect handling of different data types (ABCDataFrame, ABCSeries) within the `column_op` functions.
2. Incorrect assignment to the `new_data` variable after evaluating the column operation.
3. Inconsistent handling of different axis values within the function.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug might occur due to inconsistent handling of different data types (DataFrame, Series) in the `column_op` functions, which can lead to incorrect results when applying the operation.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that each `column_op` function correctly handles the specific data type (DataFrame, Series, scalar) and performs the operation accordingly.
2. Check the logic for handling different axis values to ensure correct column-wise or row-wise operations are performed.
3. Verify the assignment to the `new_data` variable after evaluating the column operation to capture the correct result.

## Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    result = left.copy()  # Copy the left DataFrame to not modify the original
    for col, values in new_data.items():
        result[col] = values
    return result
```

In this corrected version:
- Each `column_op` function correctly handles the specific data type and performs the operation accordingly.
- The logic for handling different axis values has been corrected to ensure proper column-wise or row-wise operations.
- The assignment to the `new_data` variable has been adjusted to capture the correct result and update the DataFrame with the new values.
