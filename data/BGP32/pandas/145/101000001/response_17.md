The bug in the provided function `dispatch_to_series` lies in the way the `column_op` function is defined based on the type of the `right` input. The function `column_op` used for dispatching to Series implementation is not defined correctly, leading to incorrect behavior in handling different types of input.

The bug causes incorrect dispatching of operations to Series based on the type of `right`. The original code defines the `column_op` function conditionally based on the type of `right`, but the implementation within these conditional branches is not correctly handling the different cases.

To fix the bug, you need to redefine the `column_op` function for each type of input `right` to appropriately dispatch operations to Series. The corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function is given below:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, the `column_op` function is redefined for each condition based on the type of `right` input, ensuring that the operations are dispatched correctly to Series. This modification should resolve the bug and improve the functionality of the `dispatch_to_series` function.
