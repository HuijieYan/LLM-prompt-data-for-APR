## Analysis:
The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is designed to evaluate frame operations by processing column-by-column and dispatching to the Series implementation. The function defines different behavior based on the type of the `right` parameter, including handling scalars, DataFrames, and Series.

## Identified Error:
The bug in the current implementation lies in the way the `column_op` function is redefined inside the `dispatch_to_series` function. The issue arises from redefining the same function multiple times without proper scoping, leading to unexpected behavior and ultimately causing the function to behave incorrectly.

## Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is that each time a new condition is met, the function `column_op` is redefined within the `dispatch_to_series` function, which results in shadowing the previous definition instead of having distinct behavior based on different conditions. This redefinition causes confusion in the control flow and leads to incorrect processing of the DataFrame columns.

## Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to define the `column_op` function outside of the `dispatch_to_series` function or have distinct functions for different conditions based on the type of the `right` parameter. By doing so, we can ensure that each condition has its own proper implementation of `column_op` without redefining it multiple times.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def column_op_scalar(a, b):
    return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

def column_op_dataframe(a, b):
    return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

def column_op_series_columns(a, b):
    return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

def column_op_series(a, b):
    return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        column_op = column_op_scalar

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        column_op = column_op_dataframe

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        column_op = column_op_series_columns

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        column_op = column_op_series

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    
    return new_data
```

By defining separate functions for different conditions and assigning the appropriate function to the `column_op` variable based on the type of `right`, we ensure that each case has its own distinct behavior. This approach fixes the bug caused by redefining the `column_op` function multiple times within the `dispatch_to_series` function.
