### Analysis
The error occurs when trying to perform the operation `df * ser` where `df` is a DataFrame and `ser` is a Series containing NaT values. The error message indicates that the operation fails due to unsupported operand types for multiplication: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'.

Looking at the buggy function `dispatch_to_series`, it is responsible for evaluating frame operations column-by-column by dispatching to the Series implementation. In the case where the right operand is a Series with NaT values, the function tries to perform the operation column-wise, leading to the error.

The issue seems to be in the way the function is handling the NaT values when attempting the operation between the DataFrame and Series. We need to modify the implementation to correctly handle these cases and avoid the TypeError.

### Bug Fixing Strategy
1. Check the logic for handling different types of right operands in the `dispatch_to_series` function.
2. Ensure that the code correctly handles the case where the right operand is a Series with NaT values.
3. Modify the implementation to perform the operation between the DataFrame and Series correctly, considering the NaT values.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        if right.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]':
            # Handle NaT values when right is a Series with timedelta dtype
            if axis == "columns":
                assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
                def column_op(a, b):
                    return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            else:
                assert right.index.equals(left.index)
                def column_op(a, b):
                    return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        else:
            raise NotImplementedError(right)

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By updating the `dispatch_to_series` function to handle the case where the right operand is a Series with timedelta dtype and NaT values, we can ensure that the operation between the DataFrame and Series is performed correctly without resulting in a TypeError.
