### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `dispatch_to_series` function when it tries to perform an operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing `NaT` values of the `timedelta64` dtype. The specific error happens at the `column_op` function inside `dispatch_to_series`, where it attempts to execute the operation on each column of the DataFrame and the Series. Since `NaT` (Not a Time) is a special missing value for datetime-like data, it cannot be used directly in arithmetic operations with numeric values like those in the DataFrame.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the Series contains `NaT` values correctly. We can modify the code in the `column_op` function to handle this special case and avoid performing arithmetic operations involving `NaT` values directly.
We can create a condition in the `column_op` function to check for `NaT` values and handle the operation accordingly.

### Corrected Code
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if pd.notna(b.iloc[i]) else np.nan for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns)) if pd.notna(b).all()}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By incorporating the condition `if pd.notna(b)` in the `column_op` function, we can handle the case where the Series contains `NaT` values and avoid the TypeError due to unsupported operand types. This correction ensures that the operation is only performed when the `NaT` values are removed from consideration.
