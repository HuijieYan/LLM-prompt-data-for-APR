### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs when trying to perform a multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing `NaT` values (null values for timedelta). The issue arises due to the unsupported operand type error between a NumPy array and a `NaTType` object.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the operation between NumPy arrays and `NaT` values gracefully. One way to address this is to handle the `NaT` values during the arithmetic operation by replacing them with a valid default value, such as `np.nan`, before performing the operation.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            b = np.where(b == pd.NaT, np.nan, b)  # Replace NaT with NaN
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By replacing `NaT` values in the Series `right` with `np.nan` before performing the arithmetic operation, we can ensure that the operation is conducted smoothly without encountering the unsupported operand type error.
