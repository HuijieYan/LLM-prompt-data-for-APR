### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the code tries to perform an operation (multiplication) between a numpy array (`a.iloc[:, i]`) and a `NaT` value, which is not supported.

In the `na_arithmetic_op` function, the error message shows that the unsupported operation is between a `numpy.ndarray` and a `NaTType`. This mismatch causes a `TypeError`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the operation is between a numpy array and `NaT` correctly. One way to address this is to skip the operation for elements with `NaT` values. We can achieve this by adding a check for `NaT` values before performing the operation.

Here is the corrected version of the `column_op` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
    import numpy as np
    from pandas._libs import NaTType

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not isinstance(b, NaTType) else b for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not isinstance(b, NaTType) else b for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By adding the check for `NaTType` in the `column_op` function, we ensure that the operation is only performed for valid elements, avoiding the `TypeError` caused by operating on a numpy array and `NaT`.
