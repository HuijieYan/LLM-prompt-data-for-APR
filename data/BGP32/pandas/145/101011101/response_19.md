The issue in the provided function is that when the `right` parameter is a scalar or a DataFrame, the `column_op` function is defined with a different behavior than when `right` is an ABCSeries. This inconsistency leads to an error when trying to perform the operation due to the mismatch in function definitions.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `column_op` function is defined consistently for all cases. Specifically, it should handle both ABCDataFrame and ABCSeries in a similar way.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """

    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
``` 

With this corrected version, the `column_op` function is defined uniformly for both cases of `right` being a scalar or a DataFrame. This should resolve the mismatch in function definitions and prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring previously.
