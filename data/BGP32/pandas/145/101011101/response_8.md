### Bug Explanation
The bug arises from the fact that the function `dispatch_to_series` is not correctly handling `NaT` values (Not-a-Time) when performing arithmetic operations. The error message indicates that the operation `*` (multiplication) is being applied between a NumPy array and `NaT`, resulting in a `TypeError` because the operation is not supported between a NumPy array and `NaT`.

The function `column_op` within `dispatch_to_series` is responsible for handling the arithmetic operation between the DataFrame columns and the right operand. In the case of dealing with `NaT` values, the function should handle them appropriately to avoid raising a `TypeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `column_op` function to correctly handle the case where the right operand is a `NaT` value. We can update the function to handle this special case and perform the arithmetic operation accordingly. By properly addressing the `NaT` values, we can ensure that the operation between the DataFrame columns and the right operand proceeds smoothly without raising any errors.

### Corrected Function
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isnull(b) else b for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) if not b.iloc[:, i].hasnans else b.iloc[:, i] for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if not pd.isnull(b.iloc[i]) else b.iloc[i] for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isnull(b) else b for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

The corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function now properly handles the case where the right operand is a `NaT` value, preventing the `TypeError` that was previously raised. This fix ensures that the arithmetic operation between the DataFrame columns and the right operand proceeds correctly, allowing the function to fulfill its intended functionality.
