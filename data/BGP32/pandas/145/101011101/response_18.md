### Bug in the Buggy Function
The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function arises from the handling of a `NaT` (Not a Time) type value in a Series during an arithmetic operation with a DataFrame. The `dispatch_to_series` function incorrectly dispatches the operation for each column of the DataFrame, resulting in a TypeError when trying to perform the operation with `NaT`.

### Bug Cause
1. The `dispatch_to_series` function tries to dispatch operations between a DataFrame and a Series containing `NaT` values by column. 
2. When handling the Series with `NaT` values, the function tries to apply the operation to each column of the DataFrame with the `NaT` value.
3. The error occurs because `NaT` (Not a Time) is a special null value in pandas and is not supported in arithmetic operations with numpy arrays, causing a TypeError.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the special case of `NaT` values when performing operations between a DataFrame and a Series more gracefully. Specifically, when encountering a `NaN` value in a Series, we need to skip the corresponding arithmetic operation instead of trying to perform it.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Below is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns)) if not pd.isnull(b.iloc[i])}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns)) if not pd.isnull(b.iloc[i])}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, we added a check for `pd.isnull(b.iloc[i])` inside the `column_op` function to skip the operation if the value of `b` (the Series being compared) is `NaT`. This modification avoids the unsupported operand type error when trying to perform arithmetic operations with `NaT` values.
