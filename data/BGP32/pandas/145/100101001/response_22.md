The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be related to how it handles operations involving a DataFrame and a Series of type `timedelta64[ns]`. In the failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting`, the intention is to perform element-wise multiplication between the DataFrame `df` and the Series `ser`, where the Series `ser` has values of `NaT` (Not a Time) and the datatype `timedelta64[ns]`.

The bug likely arises from how the function handles the operation with a Series of `timedelta64[ns]` datatype and the DataFrame. When the right operand is a Series of `timedelta64[ns]` type, there are specific rules to be applied for column-wise operation depending on the axis.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `dispatch_to_series` function to handle the case where the right operand is a Series with `timedelta64[ns]` datatype correctly. This involves ensuring that the operation is performed correctly in a column-wise manner while considering the axis parameter.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        if axis == 'columns':
            assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        else:
            assert right.index.equals(left.index)
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            
    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    
    return new_data
```

With this modification, the `dispatch_to_series` function should now correctly handle the case where the right operand is a Series with `timedelta64[ns]` datatype and perform the element-wise operation between the DataFrame columns and the Series values.
