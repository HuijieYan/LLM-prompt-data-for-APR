The issue in the `dispatch_to_series` function lies in the way the `column_op` function is defined and used for different types of inputs. The bug causes the function to not handle the operation correctly when a Series with a 'timedelta64[ns]' dtype is passed as 'right' and the 'axis' parameter is set to 'columns'.

### Bug Explanation:
In the failing test case provided, the DataFrame `df` is multiplied by the Series `ser` which contains a 'timedelta64[ns]' dtype. The `dispatch_to_series` function fails to correctly handle this operation, resulting in an incorrect output DataFrame.

The root cause of the bug is the implementation of the `column_op` function. When a Series with a 'timedelta64[ns]' dtype is passed as 'right' and the 'axis' parameter is set to 'columns', the `column_op` function should operate row-by-row. However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario and incorrectly operates column-by-column instead.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the `column_op` function to handle the row-wise operation when a Series with a 'timedelta64[ns]' dtype is passed and the 'axis' is set to 'columns'. We can achieve this by modifying the logic within the `column_op` function based on the type of input.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this correction, the `column_op` function appropriately handles the row-wise operation when needed, fixing the bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function.
