The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function arises from not handling the case where the `right` input is a `timedelta64` series correctly. The function incorrectly tries to iterate over the columns of the DataFrame and perform the operation element-wise, leading to the incorrect behavior seen in the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle the `timedelta64` series input separately and perform the operation correctly. We also need to ensure that the shape and alignment of the `left` and `right` inputs are properly checked before proceeding with the operation.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
    
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        data = {i: func(left.iloc[:, i], right) for i in range(len(left.columns))}
        
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        data = {i: func(left.iloc[:, i], right.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(left.columns))}
        
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and right.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]':
        data = {i: func(left.iloc[:, i], right) for i in range(len(left.columns))}
        
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        data = {i: func(left.iloc[:, i], right) for i in range(len(left.columns))}
        
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)
    
    new_data = expressions.evaluate(data, str_rep, left, right)
    
    return new_data
```

With this correction, the function now properly handles the case where the `right` input is a `timedelta64` series, ensuring that the operation is applied correctly. This should fix the failing test scenario provided.
