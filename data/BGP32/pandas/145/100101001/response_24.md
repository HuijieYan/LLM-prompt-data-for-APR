The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is related to how it handles the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series with timedelta64 values. The bug causes incorrect behavior where NaT values in the Series are not treated correctly, leading to a failed test case.

The issue stems from the logic inside the function that processes the operation between a DataFrame and a Series. Specifically, when handling a Series with timedelta64 values, the function fails to properly account for NaT values and perform the multiplication operation correctly.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `column_op` function within the `dispatch_to_series` function to handle NaT values appropriately when performing the multiplication operation.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            # Handle NaT values in b
            for i in range(len(b)):
                if pd.isna(b.iloc[i]):
                    b.iloc[i] = np.nan
            
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By including the logic to handle NaT values within the `column_op` function when dealing with a Series, the corrected function should now be able to correctly handle the multiplication operation involving NaT values in the Series, ensuring that the failing test case passes successfully.
