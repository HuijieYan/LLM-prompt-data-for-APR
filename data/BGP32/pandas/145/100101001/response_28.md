### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function arises from how the `column_op` function is defined and how it handles the operation between a DataFrame and a Series. When the function encounters a case where the `right` input is a Series and `axis` is not specified or is not equal to "columns", it incorrectly assumes that the operation should be applied column-wise instead of row-wise.

In the failing test scenario provided, the test expects the operation to be applied row-wise when multiplying a DataFrame by a Series with NaT values. However, the current implementation applies the operation column-wise, leading to a mismatch in the expected and actual results.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the `column_op` function to correctly handle operations between a DataFrame and a Series. Specifically, we need to ensure that the operation is applied row-wise when the `right` input is a Series and `axis` is not set to "columns".

### Corrected Function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        if axis != "columns":  # Apply row-wise if axis is not "columns"
            assert right.index.equals(left.index)
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[i, :], b) for i in range(len(a.index))}
        else:
            assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By updating the `column_op` function to handle row-wise operations correctly when the `right` input is a Series and `axis` is not set to "columns", the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
