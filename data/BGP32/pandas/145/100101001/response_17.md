### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function lies in the handling of the `left` and `right` arguments when performing the arithmetic operation. In the failing test case provided, the function fails to correctly handle the multiplication operation between a DataFrame `df` and a Series `ser` containing `NaT` values. The expected result should be a DataFrame where each column is multiplied by the corresponding value in the `ser` Series. 

However, the current implementation of the function does not correctly handle this case, resulting in an incorrect output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the case where the `right` argument is a Series containing `NaT` values. Specifically, we need to modify the `column_op` function to handle this scenario and perform the multiplication operation correctly.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this corrected version of the function, it should now correctly handle the multiplication operation between the DataFrame `df` and the Series `ser` containing `NaT` values, as demonstrated in the failing test case provided.
