The issue in the buggy function `dispatch_to_series` stems from the incorrect handling of timedelta objects in the case where the right input is a Series dtype with `timedelta64[ns]`. The function fails to properly broadcast the Series timdelta object across the columns of the DataFrame.

### Bug Explanation:
- The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` creates a DataFrame `df` and a Series `ser` both containing `NaT` values with a `timedelta64[ns]` dtype. It then performs a multiplication operation between the DataFrame and the Series using the `*` operator via the `dispatch_to_series` function.
- The function should broadcast the Series `ser` across the columns of the DataFrame `df` to create a new DataFrame where each column is multiplied by the corresponding element in the Series. However, due to the incorrect implementation in the function, it fails to handle this case properly, resulting in a mismatch between the expected and actual output DataFrames.

### Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to adjust the implementation of the `column_op` function in the `dispatch_to_series` function to correctly handle the case when `right` is a Series with `timedelta64[ns]` dtype.
- We need to broadcast the Series `b` across the columns of DataFrame `a` and perform the element-wise operation between each column of `a` and the corresponding element in `b`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

After applying this fix, the `dispatch_to_series` function should correctly handle the case when a Series with `timedelta64[ns]` dtype is passed as the right input, ensuring that the operation is broadcasted across the columns of the DataFrame as expected.
