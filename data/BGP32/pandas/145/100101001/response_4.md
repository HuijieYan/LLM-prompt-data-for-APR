### Bug Analysis:
- The bug lies in the implementation of the `column_op` function within the `dispatch_to_series` function.
- For the given test case, the function fails to correctly handle the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series with `timedelta64[ns]` dtype. The bug occurs because the implementation does not correctly handle the case when the Series has the same index as the DataFrame but different columns.

### Bug Explanation:
- In the failing test case, the DataFrame `df` has columns [0, 1] and the Series `ser` has an index of [0, 1]. The expected behavior is to perform element-wise multiplication, with each column of the DataFrame multiplied by the corresponding value in the Series based on the index relationship.
- However, the current implementation does not properly handle this scenario, leading to incorrect output when applying the multiplication operation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the `column_op` function to correctly handle the element-wise operation between a DataFrame and a Series with the same index but different columns.
- We should iterate over the columns of the DataFrame and perform the operation with the corresponding value in the Series based on the index alignment.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis in [None, "columns"]:
        if axis == "columns":
            assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
            iter_series = right.iteritems()
        else:
            assert right.index.equals(left.index)
            iter_series = right.iteritems()
        
        def column_op(a, b):
            series_values = {idx: value for idx, value in iter_series}
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], series_values[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this corrected version, the `column_op` function now correctly handles the element-wise operation between a DataFrame and a Series with the same index but different columns, ensuring alignment based on the index relationship.
