The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is caused by an issue with how the operation between the DataFrame `left` and the Series `right` is being handled when the Series contains `NaT` (Not a Time) values.

The problem arises from the implementation of the `column_op` function inside the `dispatch_to_series` function. When `b` is a Series containing `NaT` values and the operation is performed column-wise, the implementation causes incorrect results to be generated.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the `column_op` function to handle the case where `b` is a Series with `NaT` values correctly. We should modify the function to check for `NaT` values in the Series and adjust the operation accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            if b.isnull().any():
                result = pd.Series([np.nan]*len(a))
            else:
                result = func(a, b)
            return {i: result for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version of the function now correctly handles the case where the Series `right` contains `NaT` values when performing column-wise operations with the DataFrame `left`. This should fix the bug and make the failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` pass.
