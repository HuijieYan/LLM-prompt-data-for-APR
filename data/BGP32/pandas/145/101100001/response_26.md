The issue in the `dispatch_to_series` function is that it does not handle the case of a scalar value correctly when performing operations with a DataFrame. The function should be able to handle scalar values properly to ensure correct computations.

The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is that when `right` is a scalar value or a zero-dimensional array, the function generates a `column_op` function that operates on each column separately. However, the implementation inside these `column_op` functions is incorrect as it should apply the operation with the scalar value `b` across the entire column instead of row-wise.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `column_op` functions to handle scalar operations correctly. We need to modify the logic inside the `column_op` functions to apply the function `func` directly to the entire column with the scalar value `b`.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    # with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this correction, the `dispatch_to_series` function will correctly handle scalar values when performing operations with DataFrames. This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
