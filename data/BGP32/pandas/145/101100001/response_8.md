The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is related to how it handles operations involving a DataFrame and a Series of dtype `timedelta64[ns]`. In the test function provided, it tries to perform arithmetic operation (`*`) between a DataFrame `df` and a Series `ser` containing `NaT` values. The expected behavior is to have a resulting DataFrame where each column contains the corresponding `NaT` value from the Series.

The issue lies in how the `column_op` function is defined within `dispatch_to_series` for handling the case when `isinstance(right, ABCSeries)` and the dtype is `timedelta64[ns]`. The current implementation does not correctly handle this scenario, causing the bug.

To fix this bug, we need to update the implementation of the `column_op` function inside `dispatch_to_series` for the case when `right` is an `ABCSeries` with `timedelta64[ns]` dtype. We need to modify the function to handle `NaT` values correctly and return the correct result for each column.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            if b.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]':
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            else:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this correction, the `dispatch_to_series` function should now correctly handle the arithmetic operation involving a DataFrame and a Series with `timedelta64[ns]` dtype, ensuring that `NaT` values are processed appropriately. The failing test should now pass with this fix.
