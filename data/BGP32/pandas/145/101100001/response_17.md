## Analysis:
The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is responsible for evaluating frame operation by column-by-column dispatching to the Series implementation. The function defines different behaviors based on the type of the `right` input parameter. The bug seems to be related to the handling of the `right` parameter and the column operations performed within the function.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of the `right` parameter and its type.
2. Inconsistent behavior in defining `column_op` based on the type of `right`.
3. Potential issue with the expression evaluation using `expressions.evaluate`.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect implementation of the column operation function `column_op` based on the type of the `right` parameter. This leads to unexpected behavior when evaluating the frame operation in `dispatch_to_series`, causing the failing test case to generate incorrect results.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Correctly define the behavior of the column operation function `column_op` for each type of `right` parameter.
2. Ensure that the column operations are performed correctly based on the type of `right`.
3. Verify the expression evaluation process to generate the correct output DataFrame.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating column-by-column,
    dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left: DataFrame
    right: scalar or DataFrame
    func: arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep: str or None, default None
    axis: {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)

    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By updating the behavior of `column_op` based on the type of `right` parameter, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test case.
