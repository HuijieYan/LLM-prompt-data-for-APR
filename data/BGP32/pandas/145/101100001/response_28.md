The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is related to the handling of `timedelta64` data type. The issue arises when performing arithmetic operations between a DataFrame and a Series of `timedelta64` data type. The bug causes `timedelta64` data to be mistakenly treated as `datetime64`, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the function to correctly handle `timedelta64` data types during the operation. Specifically, we need to ensure that the `func` applied to the columns maintains the correct data type. We can achieve this by checking the data type of the right operand in the `dispatch_to_series` function and appropriately handling `timedelta64` data type cases.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later
        if right.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]':
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]).astype('timedelta64[ns]') for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        else:
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this correction, the function now explicitly handles `timedelta64` data type operations and ensures that the correct data type is maintained during the operation, fixing the bug in the original implementation. The provided failing test should now pass with the corrected function.
