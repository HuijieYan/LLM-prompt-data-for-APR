## Analysis:
1. The `dispatch_to_series` function is designed to evaluate the frame operation `func(left, right)` by dispatching to the Series implementation. It handles different cases based on the type of `right` input.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the `column_op` function is defined within the `dispatch_to_series` function.
3. The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` in the `test_arithmetic.py` file is trying to test the behavior of the operation between a DataFrame and a Series with `timedelta64` type. It fails due to the bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function.
4. The bug seems to be related to the handling of the case when `right` is a Series with dtype `timedelta64[ns]`. The incorrect implementation of `column_op` for this case seems to cause the incorrect result.
5. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the `column_op` function implementation for the case when `right` is a Series with dtype `timedelta64[ns]`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and right.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]':
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By adding an additional check for `right.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]'` and adjusting the `column_op` function for this case, the bug should be fixed.
