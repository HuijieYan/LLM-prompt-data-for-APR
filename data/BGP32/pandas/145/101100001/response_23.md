Based on the analysis of the buggy function `dispatch_to_series`, the issue seems to be related to the handling of timedelta operations in combination with DataFrame arithmetic. The problem might arise from the way the `column_op` functions are defined based on the type of input `right`, leading to incorrect output.

One potential strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the `column_op` functions correctly handle timedelta operations when `right` is a scalar or a DataFrame containing timedelta values.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    # with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        # Handle scalar case
        if isinstance(right, Timedelta):
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        else:
            raise NotImplementedError(right)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version includes a specific handling for timedelta values in the case where `right` is a scalar. This modification helps in correctly performing the column-wise operation based on the type of input `right`, ensuring that timedelta operations are handled appropriately.

This corrected version should pass the failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` in the `pandas/tests/frame/test_arithmetic.py` file by correctly processing the DataFrame arithmetic involving timedelta values.
