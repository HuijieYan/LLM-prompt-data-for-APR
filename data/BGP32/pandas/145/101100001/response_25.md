The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is related to the handling of timedelta objects (`timedelta64`) in DataFrame arithmetic. The function is not correctly dispatching operations involving timedelta values, leading to incorrect results.

The issue arises when the function encounters a timedelta object as the `right` argument. The function should handle timedelta objects appropriately based on their type and properties.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to handle timedelta objects correctly when performing operations with DataFrames. We should check the type of the `right` argument and implement the necessary logic to handle timedelta values appropriately.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and isinstance(right.dtype, ABCTimedelta):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version includes a check for timedelta objects (`ABCTimedelta`) in the `elif` statement for handling operations with a series of timedelta values. This change ensures that timedelta objects are processed correctly in DataFrame arithmetic operations.

After applying this fix, the `dispatch_to_series` function should now handle timedelta objects appropriately and pass the failing test mentioned above.
