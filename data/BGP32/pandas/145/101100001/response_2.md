## Analysis:
- The `dispatch_to_series` function is responsible for evaluating DataFrame arithmetic operations column-by-column by dispatching to the Series implementation.
- The bug is likely in how the `column_op` function is defined based on the input arguments and conditions. The bug may be related to handling different types of inputs (scalar, DataFrame, Series) in the `column_op` function.
- The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` tries to perform a multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing timedelta values. The expected output is creating a DataFrame where each column in the DataFrame is multiplied by the corresponding value of the Series.

## Bug Explanation:
- The bug occurs due to how the `column_op` function is defined within different conditions for handling different input types. There are discrepancies in handling various cases, especially when dealing with scalar, DataFrame, and Series inputs.
- The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` specifically tests DataFrame arithmetic with timedelta values, which triggers the bug in the `column_op` function.

## Fix Strategy:
- Update the `column_op` function within each condition to correctly handle the input arguments based on the type of input (scalar, DataFrame, Series).
- Ensure that the logic inside the `column_op` function correctly processes the DataFrame columns according to the input type.
- Make sure to correctly handle the multiplication operation between DataFrame and Series when timedelta values are involved.

## Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By updating the `column_op` function within each condition to handle the specific input types correctly, the corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing test.
