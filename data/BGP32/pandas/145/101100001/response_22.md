The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is causing an error when trying to perform arithmetic operations between a DataFrame and a Series with `timedelta64[ns]` dtype. The bug is related to how the function handles the different cases of the right operand.

The issue arises because when the right operand is a Series with `timedelta64[ns]` dtype, the function fails to properly handle the column-wise operation. As a result, the calculation is incorrect, leading to the failing test case.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the implementation of the function to correctly handle the case when the right operand is a Series with `timedelta64[ns]` dtype. Specifically, we need to ensure that the column-wise operation is performed correctly for this case.

Here is the corrected version of the function `dispatch_to_series`:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this corrected version, the function should now properly handle the arithmetic operation between a DataFrame and a Series with `timedelta64[ns]` dtype, and pass the failing test case.
