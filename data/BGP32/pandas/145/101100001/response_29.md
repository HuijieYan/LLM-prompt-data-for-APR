## Analysis:
The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is responsible for evaluating frame operation by dispatching to the Series implementation column-by-column. It handles different cases based on the type of the `right` input.

## Identified issue:
The issue lies in the implementation of the `column_op` functions within the `dispatch_to_series` function. The implementation of `column_op` does not properly handle the operation when `right` is a scalar or `ABCDataFrame`, resulting in incorrect behavior.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of the different cases in the `column_op` functions. When `right` is a scalar or `ABCDataFrame`, the code does not correctly iterate over the columns and perform the operation leading to incorrect results.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `column_op` functions for scalar and `ABCDataFrame` cases to correctly iterate over the columns and apply the operation. 

## Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

After applying the corrected version of the function, the failing test for the `test_td64_op_nat_casting` should now pass without any issues.
