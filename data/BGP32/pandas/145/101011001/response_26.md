The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function arises from the handling of the `NaT` (Not a Time) values when performing arithmetic operations between a DataFrame and a Series containing `NaT` values. The error message indicates that the operation `*` (multiplication) is being applied between a DataFrame and a Series containing `NaT` values, leading to a `TypeError` due to unsupported operand types.

The bug occurs in the following section of the code:
```python
result = expressions.evaluate(op, str_rep, left, right, **eval_kwargs)
```

The `op` in this case is the built-in multiplication function `<built-in function mul>`, and the operands `left` and `right` are a DataFrame and a Series containing `NaT` values, respectively. This combination results in the `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the operation involves `NaT` values in a way that prevents the unsupported operand types error. One way to address this is to check for `NaT` values explicitly and handle them appropriately during the operation.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns) if not pd.isna(b))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns)) if not pd.isna(b.iloc[i])}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns)) if not pd.isna(b.iloc[i])}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns)) if not pd.isna(b)}

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, I added checks to handle `NaT` values in the Series `right` during the column-wise operations in the `column_op` functions. By excluding columns with `NaT` values from the operation, we prevent the `TypeError` related to unsupported operand types.

This correction should address the issue with arithmetic operations involving `NaT` values and allow the function to handle such cases correctly.
