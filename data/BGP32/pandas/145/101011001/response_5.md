Based on the provided information and error message, the bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be related to the handling of the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing NaT values. The error message indicates an issue with unsupported operand types for multiplication involving a NumPy array and NaTType.

### Bug Cause:
When trying to perform the multiplication operation, the function attempts to evaluate the operation on the NaT values in the Series and the DataFrame, leading to the TypeError because the operation is not supported between a NumPy array and NaTType.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the scenario where the operation involves NaT values correctly. One approach is to apply the operation only to valid non-null elements in the arrays, skipping the invalid NaT values.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    
    def masked_op(a, b, op):
        mask = a.notna() & b.notna()
        result = a.copy()
        result[mask] = op(a[mask], b[mask])
        return result

    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return masked_op(a, b, func)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return masked_op(a, b, func)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return masked_op(a, b, func)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return masked_op(a, b, func)

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, a new `masked_op` function is introduced to handle masked arithmetic operations by excluding NaN values when applying the operation element-wise. This modification should resolve the issue with unsupported operand types involving NumPy arrays and NaT values.
