The bug in the provided function `dispatch_to_series` is causing a TypeError when trying to perform a multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing NaT values. The error occurs because the function is not handling this specific case properly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely due to how the function `column_op` is implemented inside the `dispatch_to_series` function. The buggy version of `column_op` is not properly handling the case when one of the operands is NaT, which leads to the TypeError in the evaluation stage.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the implementation of the `column_op` function inside the `dispatch_to_series`. Specifically, we should handle the case when one of the operands is NaT to avoid the TypeError during evaluation.

### Bug Fix and Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns) if not pd.isna(b) else b)}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns)) if not pd.isna(b)}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version includes a check for `pd.isna(b)` when performing element-wise operations between the DataFrame columns and the Series. This check will prevent the TypeError when encountering NaT values in the Series.

By making this modification, the function should now properly handle the case when one of the operands is NaT and pass the failing test case.
