### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs due to the handling of NA values (NaT) in the operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing NaT values. The TypeError arises because the operation between a numpy array and NaT is not supported.

### Bug Explanation:
When the `dispatch_to_series` function is called with a DataFrame (`left`) and a Series containing NaT values (`right`), it tries to perform an operation between the DataFrame column values and the NaT values. The problem arises when trying to compute `func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i])` within the `column_op` function for each column. The operation involving NaT and numpy arrays raises a TypeError, leading to the failure.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the DataFrame column contains NaT values and perform the operation considering these NA values correctly. One common methodology is to check for the presence of NaT values during the operation and skip those specific computations.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isnull(b) else np.nan for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if not pd.isnull(b.iloc[i]) else np.nan for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isnull(b) else np.nan for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By checking for NaT values in the `column_op` function and handling them appropriately, we should be able to fix the bug and ensure the function works correctly with NaT values during operations.
