### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs when trying to perform an arithmetic operation (multiplication) between a DataFrame and a Series where the Series contains NaT values. This triggers a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'` error. The issue lies in the `dispatch_to_series` function and specifically in the `column_op` function defined within it.

In the failing scenario, the input `right` is a Series containing NaT values, causing the error when trying to perform the operation column-wise.

The `column_op` function in the `dispatch_to_series` method incorrectly handles the multiplication operation when a Series with NaT values is provided. It should account for this scenario and handle it appropriately.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the `column_op` function within the `dispatch_to_series` method to handle the case of performing an operation with a Series containing NaT values. Instead of trying to perform the operation as is, we should skip performing the operation for columns that have NaT values.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns)) if not pd.isna(b.iloc[i])}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns)) if not pd.isna(b.iloc[i])}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
``` 

By excluding the columns with NaT values from the operation, the corrected function should now handle the case of performing arithmetic operations between a DataFrame and a Series containing NaT values without triggering the `TypeError`.
