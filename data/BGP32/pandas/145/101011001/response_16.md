The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be related to the handling of operations between a DataFrame and a Series containing `NaT` values, specifically when trying to perform a multiplication operation.

Based on the provided information and the error message, the issue seems to arise when the function tries to evaluate the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing `NaT` values, resulting in a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'`.

To fix this issue, we need to modify how the operation is handled when encountering `NaT` values in the Series. One approach is to check for `NaT` values in the Series and handle them accordingly.

Here is a corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    # with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        matched_indices = left.columns.intersection(right.index)
        if not matched_indices.empty:
            right = right.reindex(matched_indices)
            right = right.where(~right.isnull(), np.nan)

            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        else:
            raise ValueError("Cannot broadcast operands together.")

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In this corrected version, we check for matching indices between the DataFrame columns and the Series index. If there are matching indices, we handle the operation by iterating over the columns and performing the operation while considering `NaT` values as `np.nan`. If there are no matching indices, we raise a ValueError indicating that the operands cannot be broadcast together.

This fix should address the issue described in the failing test case by properly handling operations involving `NaT` values in the Series.
