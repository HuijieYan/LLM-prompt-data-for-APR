### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs when trying to perform a multiplication operation (`<built-in function mul>`) on a DataFrame and a Series containing `NaT` (Not-a-Time) values. The error message indicates that there is an unsupported operand type for the operation between a 'numpy.ndarray' (representing the DataFrame) and 'NaTType' (representing the `NaT` values in the Series).

The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is responsible for evaluating the operation based on the input types. The issue arises from the implementation of the `column_op` function within `dispatch_to_series`, specifically when dealing with the case of a Series with `NaT` values and the 'columns' axis.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case of operating on a Series with `NaT` values properly, ensuring that the operation can be executed successfully. The `column_op` function inside the `dispatch_to_series` function needs to be adjusted to handle this specific scenario correctly.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:].reset_index(drop=True)) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

The key change in the corrected version is in the `column_op` function for the case of a Series on the 'columns' axis with `NaT` values. It now uses `b.iloc[:].reset_index(drop=True)` to handle the Series with `NaT` values properly during the operation. This change ensures that the operation between the DataFrame columns and the Series rows is executed correctly.
