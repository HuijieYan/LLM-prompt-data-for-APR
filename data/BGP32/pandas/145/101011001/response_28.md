The bug in the provided function `dispatch_to_series` is causing a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'` error when trying to perform an operation involving a DataFrame and a Series containing NaT values.

### Bug Analysis:
- The function `dispatch_to_series` is designed to evaluate frame operations by dispatching column-by-column to the Series implementation through the `column_op` function.
- The issue arises when the function encounters a Series containing NaT values (`NaT` represents missing values in datetime data), leading to a TypeError during the evaluation process.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs due to the implementation of the `column_op` function within the `dispatch_to_series` function. The `column_op` function is defined to handle operations between a DataFrame and another DataFrame or a scalar, but it doesn't appropriately handle operations involving a DataFrame and a Series.
- When the `column_op` function is called with a DataFrame (a) and a Series (b) containing NaT values, it attempts to perform the operation directly on the numpy arrays of the DataFrame columns and the Series values, leading to the TypeError.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `column_op` function handles the case when a Series with NaT values is provided correctly. This involves iterating over the columns of the DataFrame and applying the operation to each column and the corresponding Series element rather than directly performing the operation on numpy arrays.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    
    def column_op(a, b):
        return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i % len(b)]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        right = pd.Series([right] * len(left))

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version:
- The `column_op` function now correctly iterates over the columns of the DataFrame and the Series elements, handling cases where the Series contains NaT values or scalar values.
- If the right input is a scalar or a scalar-like object, it is converted into a Series with the same value repeated for each row.
- The corrected version should now handle operations involving a DataFrame and a Series containing NaT values without raising a TypeError.
