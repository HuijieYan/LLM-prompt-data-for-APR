The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is causing a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'` error when trying to perform the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing NaT values.

### Bug Analysis:
- The function `dispatch_to_series` is responsible for evaluating frame operations by dispatching to the Series implementation.
- It defines different behavior based on the type of the `right` parameter (scalar, DataFrame, or Series), and the `axis` parameter.
- The error occurs when trying to apply the arithmetic function on elements of the DataFrame and Series, resulting in a numpy-array object that is not compatible with the NaT type.

### Bug Location:
The issue is occurring in the nested function `column_op`, specifically in cases where the `right` parameter is a Series containing NaT values.

### Bug Cause:
- The `column_op` function is iterating over columns of the DataFrame and Series to apply the arithmetic function. 
- When the `right` parameter is a Series containing NaT values, the operation with numpy arrays in the `op` function leads to incompatible operand types error.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `column_op` function or related logic to handle the case when the `right` parameter contains NaT values.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `column_op` function to handle the incompatible operand types error between numpy arrays and NaT values:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    # ... previous implementation ...

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # Handle the case where right is a Series with NaT values
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            if b.isna().any():  # Check if any NaT values in Series b
                return {i: b[i] if pd.isna(b[i]) else func(a.iloc[:, i], b[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            else:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    # ... handle other cases as needed ...

    # Remaining implementation stays the same
    
    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version includes a check for NaT values in the Series `b` before performing the operation, ensuring that operations with incompatible operand types are avoided.
