### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs due to the mismatch in types during the multiplication operation between a NumPy array and NaT (Not-a-Time) type. The error arises in the `na_arithmetic_op` function, specifically in the `_evaluate_standard` function, where the multiplication operation (`op`) is performed directly on a NumPy array and NaT type, leading to a `TypeError`.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In the failing test case, the input DataFrame `left` contains numerical values, and the input Series `right` contains NaT values of timedelta type.
2. The `dispatch_to_series` function is invoked with the provided inputs.
3. Based on the logic in the function, the operation is dispatched to the `column_op` function, which iterates over the columns of the DataFrame and applies the operation between each column and the corresponding element of the Series.
4. The final operation is evaluated using `expressions.evaluate` which eventually leads to the error due to the unsupported multiplication operation between a NumPy array and NaT type.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this issue, we need to handle the case where the right operand is NaT (Not-a-Time) differently when performing arithmetic operations. One approach is to ignore NaT values during the operation. 

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        mapped_values = {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], right) for i in range(len(left.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        mapped_values = {i: func(left.iloc[:, i], right.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(left.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        mapped_values = {i: func(left.iloc[:, i], right.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(left.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        mapped_values = {i: func(left.iloc[:, i], right) for i in range(len(left.columns))}
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = pd.DataFrame(mapped_values)
    return new_data
```

By directly creating a DataFrame `new_data` from the calculated values in `mapped_values` and returning it, we can avoid the unsupported operand type error encountered with NumPy arrays and NaT type. This modification ensures that the arithmetic operations are correctly handled for the given input types.
