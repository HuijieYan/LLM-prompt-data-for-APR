### Bug Analysis:
The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` when performing the operation `op(a, b)` because the operands are `numpy.ndarray` and `NaTType` (Not a Time). This error occurs during the evaluation of the expression in the `dispatch_to_series` function.

Looking at the runtime values provided, we can see that the issue arises when multiplying a DataFrame `left` by a Series `right` where the Series contains NaT values.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The `column_op` function inside the `dispatch_to_series` function is designed to operate column-wise on the input DataFrame based on the type of the right operand (`right`).
2. When the right operand is a Series, the `column_op` function attempts to perform the operation for each column in the DataFrame and the corresponding row in the Series.
3. However, the issue arises with NaT values in the Series, which causes a `TypeError` when trying to perform arithmetic operations with the NaT value and the numeric values in the DataFrame.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the right operand is a Series containing NaT values. We should modify the `column_op` function to handle this situation gracefully by skipping operations involving NaT values.

### Corrected Version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if not pd.isna(b.iloc[i]) else b.iloc[i] for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isna(b.iloc[i]) else b.iloc[i] for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By adding a check to skip operations involving NaT values in the Series, we prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring during the arithmetic operation. This corrected version should now handle the multiplication operation correctly even when the right operand contains NaT values.
