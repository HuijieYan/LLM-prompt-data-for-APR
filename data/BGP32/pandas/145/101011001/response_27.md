### Analysis
The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is designed to evaluate frame operations column-by-column by dispatching to the Series implementation. The problem occurs due to handling of scalar `right` values where the function is trying to perform operations that are not defined, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to multiply a NumPy array with `NaT` (Not a Time) type.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the logic within the `column_op` function where the `func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i])` operation is being performed. When `b` is a scalar `NaT`, it causes a `TypeError` since NumPy arrays (which `a.iloc[:, i]` represents) and `NaTType` are not directly compatible for arithmetic operations.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the right operand `b` is a scalar `NaT` and avoid performing arithmetic operations directly on NumPy arrays with `NaTType`. A workaround is to check for the presence of `NaT` values before performing the operation.

### Corrected Version
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            if pd.api.types.is_scalar(b) and pd.isna(b):
                return {i: b for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            else:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```  

This corrected version includes a check to handle the case where the right operand `b` is a scalar `NaT` to avoid the `TypeError` that was encountered previously. Now, the function will only assign `NaT` values to the resulting dictionary if `b` is a scalar and is `NaT`.
