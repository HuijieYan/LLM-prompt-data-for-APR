### Explanation:
The failing test is trying to perform element-wise multiplication between a DataFrame `df` and a Series `ser` containing NaT (Not a Time) values. This operation should result in a DataFrame where each column is multiplied by the corresponding element in the Series. However, the current implementation of the `dispatch_to_series` function is not handling the case where the right operand contains NaT values properly, leading to a TypeError during evaluation.

Looking at the runtime values and types, we see that the function is dispatching to the appropriate `column_op` implementation for a Series, but the issue lies in how the calculation is being performed inside the `column_op` function. The function is trying to apply the function `func` between a column in the DataFrame and the corresponding element in the Series. However, when the Series contains NaT values, this operation leads to a TypeError because NumPy does not support multiplication between a numpy.ndarray and NaTType.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this issue, we need to handle the case where the right operand contains NaT values appropriately in the `column_op` function. One way to do this is to check for NaT values in the Series before performing the operation and apply a different logic for handling these values.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            if pd.isna(b):  # Check for NaT values
                return {i: np.nan for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            if pd.isna(b):  # Check for NaT values
                return {i: np.nan for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By checking for NaT values in the Series input before performing the operation, we ensure that the function can handle such cases gracefully and avoid the TypeError observed in the failing test.
