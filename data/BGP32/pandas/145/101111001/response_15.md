### Analysis
In the failing test, the `dispatch_to_series` function is called with a DataFrame `left`, a Series `right`, and the operation `mul`. The purpose of the function is to evaluate the operation column by column, considering different cases based on the type of `right` and the value of `axis`. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the multiplication operation between an array (or ndarray) and `NaT`.

Looking at the code execution and the runtime values, it seems that the function `column_op` implementation for when `right` is an ABCSeries doesn't handle the case where `right` is `NaT` correctly. This can be observed in the line `return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}`, where the multiplication operation is performed between an ndarray `a.iloc[:, i]` and `NaT`.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of the operation when `right` is `NaT` within the `column_op` function. Performing an arithmetic operation between an ndarray and `NaT` results in the unsupported operand error observed in the failing test.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the implementation in the `column_op` function for the case when `right` is `NaT`. We should handle this situation by skipping the operation for columns where `right` is `NaT`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns)) if not pd.isnull(b.iloc[i])}  # Skip operation if b is NaT

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version includes a check to skip the operation for columns where `right` is `NaT`, ensuring that the multiplication operation does not take place in those cases.
