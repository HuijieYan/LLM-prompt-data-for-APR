The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function arises from the handling of the operation between a DataFrame and a Series with NaT values. The error occurs because the function does not properly handle the arithmetic operation between the DataFrame and Series when the Series contains NaT values.

The issue is specifically in the `column_op` function defined within the `dispatch_to_series` function. When trying to operate between a DataFrame column and a Series containing NaT, the operation fails due to unsupported operand types.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the Series contains NaT values appropriately in the `column_op` function. By checking for NaT values in the Series and skipping the operation in those cases, we can avoid the unsupported operand type error.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if not pd.isnull(b.iat[i]) else b.iat[i] for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index) 

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isnull(b.iat[i]) else b.iat[i] for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version should handle the case of operating between a DataFrame and a Series with NaT values correctly and pass the failing test provided.
