The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to stem from the handling of the `NaN` values from the `right` parameter when performing arithmetic operations with a DataFrame. The error message indicates that the operation `op` with the NaN values is causing a `TypeError`.

The issue arises when trying to perform multiplication (`*`) between the DataFrame `left` and the Series `right` containing `NaN` values.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the implementation so that the arithmetic operation is performed only on non-null elements of the input arrays. This modification will prevent the `TypeError` caused by trying to perform an operation involving 'NaTType'.

Below is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    # Convert NaN values in right to None
    right = right.where(~pd.isnull(right), None)

    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This correction ensures that any `NaN` values from the `right` Series parameter are converted to `None` before performing the arithmetic operation on the DataFrame. This should prevent the `TypeError` caused by operations involving NaTType.

Please test this corrected version to ensure that it resolves the issue with the failing test case.
