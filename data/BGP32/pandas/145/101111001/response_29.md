### Analysis
The error originates from the `dispatch_to_series` function when trying to perform arithmetic operation `*` between a DataFrame and a Series containing NaT values. The function uses `column_op` to perform the operation column-wise, but it doesn't handle the case where one of the operands is NaT correctly, leading to a TypeError during evaluation.

### Bug Cause
The issue arises because the `column_op` function in the `dispatch_to_series` buggy function does not have proper handling for the case where one operand is a NaT value. This causes a TypeError when trying to perform the arithmetic operation.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the `column_op` function inside the `dispatch_to_series` function to handle the case where one of the operands is NaT properly. We should check for NaT values and skip the operation for those specific values.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b[i]) if b[i] is not pd.NaT else pd.NaT for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this correction, the `column_op` function now properly handles the case when one of the operands is a NaT value, bypassing the operation in such scenarios.
