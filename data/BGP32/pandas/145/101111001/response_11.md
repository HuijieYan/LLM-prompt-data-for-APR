### Bug Analysis
The error message indicates a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'` when trying to perform the multiplication operation between a NumPy array and NaT (Not-a-Time) type. This error occurs during the evaluation process in the `dispatch_to_series` function, specifically in the `column_op` function when attempting to apply the arithmetic operation.

Looking at the runtime values and types provided, we can see that the issue arises because the function is trying to perform element-wise arithmetic operations between a DataFrame and a Series containing NaT values. NaT values are not directly compatible with NumPy array calculations, leading to the TypeError.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when the operation involves NaT values properly. Since NaT values represent missing or undefined times, arithmetic operations with them should result in NaN values. We can modify the `column_op` function inside the `dispatch_to_series` function to check for NaT values and return NaN for those cases.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if not pd.isnull(b.iloc[i]) else np.nan for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isnull(b) else np.nan for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By explicitly checking for NaN values when operating with NaT values in the `column_op` function, we ensure that the arithmetic operation results in NaN where appropriate, avoiding the TypeError.
