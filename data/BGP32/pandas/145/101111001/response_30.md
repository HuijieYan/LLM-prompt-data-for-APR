### Explanation:
The failing test is attempting to perform an operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing 'NaT' values (Missing values in time), leading to a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'`. The issue arises from how the `dispatch_to_series` function handles the operation between a DataFrame and a Series with 'NaT' values.

In the buggy function `dispatch_to_series`, when the right input is a Series and the axis is "columns", the function is attempting to perform element-wise operations between the DataFrame columns and the Series values. However, when encountering 'NaT' values, the operation fails due to unsupported types.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the implementation inside the `dispatch_to_series` function to handle the case where the right input is a Series with 'NaT' values more effectively. We should consider the type of operation and how it should be applied to handle the 'NaT' values correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version of the function should now properly handle the operation between a DataFrame and a Series with 'NaT' values, preventing the `TypeError` that was occurring before.
