### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is designed to evaluate frame operations by dispatching them to the Series implementation. The bug seems to be related to handling timedelta operations (timedelta64) when multiplying a DataFrame with a Series containing NaT (Not a Time) values.

1. The failing test involves multiplying a DataFrame `df` with a Series `ser` containing NaT values. The expected result is another DataFrame where each column contains the corresponding NaT value from the Series.

2. The error occurs in the `column_op` function called within `dispatch_to_series`. The implementation of `column_op` for handling the case where `right` is a Series and the axis is not "columns" or for other cases is incorrect.

3. The key issue is that the current implementation of `column_op` doesn't handle the case where `right` contains NaT values properly, leading to a TypeError when trying to perform the operation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the implementation of `column_op` within the `dispatch_to_series` function. Specifically, for cases where the right operand is a Series containing NaT values, we need to handle these values correctly during the operation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            # Handle the case of NaT values in the Series
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if not pd.isnull(b.iloc[i]) else b.iloc[i] for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

After making this correction, the `dispatch_to_series` function should be able to handle operations involving NaT values in the Series correctly, resolving the TypeError in the failing test.
