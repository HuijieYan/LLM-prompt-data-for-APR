The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function arises from the column-wise operation being performed incorrectly when one input is a scalar or a Series (`right` parameter) of different types. The issue occurs in the construction of the `new_data` dictionary inside the `dispatch_to_series` function. When the input `right` is a Series, the function needs to handle the operation column by column or row by row based on the alignment with the DataFrame `left`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the column-wise operation in the `dispatch_to_series` function to correctly handle the different cases when `right` is a scalar, a DataFrame, or a Series. We need to ensure that for each column in the DataFrame `left`, the operation is applied correctly based on the alignment with the corresponding column or value in `right`.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By applying this fix, the `dispatch_to_series` function should now handle the column-wise operations correctly for different types of `right` inputs, ensuring proper alignment and execution of the operations. This correction should address the failing test scenario provided.
