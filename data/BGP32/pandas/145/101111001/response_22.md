### Explanation:
The bug occurs when the `dispatch_to_series` function is called with a DataFrame and a Series containing `NaT` values for the multiplication operation. The bug originates from the implementation of the `column_op` function inside the `dispatch_to_series` function.

1. The `column_op` function is supposed to perform element-wise operations on columns of a DataFrame based on the type of the right operand (scalar, DataFrame, or Series).
2. However, in the case where the right operand is a Series and the axis is not specified as `"columns"`, the implementation of `column_op` incorrectly tries to operate on the rows instead of columns.
3. This incorrect operation leads to a type error when trying to perform the operation between an array and `NaTType`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `column_op` function correctly handles the scenario where a Series is provided as the `right` operand and applies the operation column-wise when required.

### Corrected Version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # Operate column-wise
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By updating the `column_op` implementation to handle column-wise operations correctly based on the axis parameter in the `dispatch_to_series` function, the bug causing the type error when operating with `NaTType` should be resolved.
