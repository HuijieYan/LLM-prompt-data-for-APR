The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` fails to handle the case where the input `right` is a Series of timedelta values and the operation is to multiply it with a DataFrame. The bug occurs because the function doesn't correctly handle the element-wise operation between the DataFrame columns and the Series values.

The bug can be fixed by modifying the `column_op` function for this specific case. Instead of looping through the columns of the DataFrame, it should loop through the rows and perform the operation element-wise.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # Handle row-wise operation when Series is aligned with columns
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[i], b) for i in range(len(a))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this correction, the `dispatch_to_series` function should now handle the case of multiplying a DataFrame with a Series of timedelta values correctly, passing the failing test case provided.
