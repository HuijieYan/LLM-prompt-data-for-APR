The issue in the `dispatch_to_series` function arises due to how the `column_op` function creates a dictionary with column index and the result of applying the arithmetic operation. The function incorrectly handles the case when the right parameter is a Series with "columns" axis, which leads to incorrect processing.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the `column_op` function to correctly handle the case when `right` is a Series with "columns" axis by indexing the Series by rows (`b.iloc[i]`) instead of columns (`b`). This way, we ensure that the arithmetic operation is applied row-by-row as intended.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We now correctly index the Series row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this correction, the `dispatch_to_series` function should now handle the case when the right parameter is a Series with "columns" axis correctly, allowing the failing test case to pass as expected.
