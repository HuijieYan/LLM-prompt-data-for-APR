### Analysis:
- The error occurs during the evaluation of the arithmetic operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing `NaT` values.
- The specific error message indicates an unsupported operand type for multiplication between `numpy.ndarray` and `NaTType`.
- The buggy function in question is `dispatch_to_series`, which is responsible for evaluating column-wise operations between a DataFrame and another object.
- The error arises in the `column_op` function defined within `dispatch_to_series`, which is used to perform the actual operation on the columns of the DataFrame.
- The current implementation of `column_op` does not handle the case where one of the operands is `NaT`, leading to the TypeError.
  
### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the `column_op` function within `dispatch_to_series` not handling the case of one of the operands being `NaT`. This causes a TypeError when trying to perform the arithmetic operation involving `NaT`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `column_op` function to handle the case where one of the operands is `NaT`. One possible solution is to use NumPy's `np.where` function to replace the `NaT` values with a compatible value for the operation.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns)}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns)}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns)}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], np.where(pd.isna(b), np.nan, b)) for i in range(len(a.columns)}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this correction, in the case where `right` is an `ABCSeries` and contains `NaT`, the `column_op` function replaces the `NaT` values with `np.nan` before performing the operation. This modification should prevent the TypeError that was occurring before.
