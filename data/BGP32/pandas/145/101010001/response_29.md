### Analysis:
1. The `dispatch_to_series` function is responsible for evaluating frame operations column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.
2. The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` when performing an arithmetic operation involving a NumPy array (`x`) and a NaT (Not a Time) value.
3. The error occurs in the `na_arithmetic_op` function in the `pandas.core.ops.array_ops` module, specifically in the `masked_arith_op` function within it. The error is triggered by the operation involving the NumPy array and NaT value.
4. The bug is likely due to the operation attempting to perform arithmetic with incompatible types (numpy.ndarray and NaTType).
5. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the operation involves a NumPy array and a NaT value appropriately.

### Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and right.isnull().any():
        new_data = left.copy()
        for col in new_data.columns:
            new_data[col] = func(new_data[col], right)
        return new_data

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, a specific check is added to handle the case when the `right` input is a Series containing NaN values. Instead of trying to perform the operation directly, the function now creates a new DataFrame (a copy of `left`) and applies the operation to each column while handling NaN values appropriately.

This fix addresses the issue where the operation involves a NumPy array and a NaT value, ensuring that the operation is handled correctly without raising a TypeError.
