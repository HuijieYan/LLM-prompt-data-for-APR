### Analysis:
The error message indicates that there is an issue with the operation being performed between a numpy array and NaT (Not-a-Time) type. The error occurs when trying to multiply the DataFrame `df` with the Series `ser`. The core of the issue is within the `dispatch_to_series` function when calling the `expressions.evaluate` function.

### Bug:
The bug arises due to the creation of a function `column_op` inside the `dispatch_to_series` function, which performs the operation between columns of data. In the case where the right operand is NaT, the operation with the numpy array fails, leading to a type error.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to address the specific case where the right operand is NaT. The operation involving NaT should be handled differently to avoid the unsupported operand type error.

### Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index) 

        def column_op(a, b):
            if not np.issubdtype(b.dtype, np.datetime64):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            else:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns)) if not pd.isna(b[i])}

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the updated code, we added a condition to check if the dtype of the right operand is a datetime type before performing the operation `func`. This change ensures that the operation will only be performed if the right operand is not NaT, avoiding the TypeError encountered previously.
