### Analysis:
The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` occurring due to an unsupported operand type for multiplication (`*`) between a numpy array and NaT (Not a Time) type. The error seems to be located in the `dispatch_to_series` function, specifically in the `column_op` function within the multiple conditions.

### Bug:
The bug stems from not handling the case correctly when the `right` input is a NaT type while trying to perform element-wise operations.

### Suggested Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when the `right` input is a NaT type properly by checking the type and adjusting the behavior accordingly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if not pd.isna(b.iloc[i]) else np.nan for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isna(b) else np.nan for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, I added checks to handle the case where the `right` input is a NaT type. These checks ensure that the operation between the DataFrame and NaT type results in NaN values in the output DataFrame. This modification should prevent the `TypeError` that was encountered and make the function handle NaT values correctly.
