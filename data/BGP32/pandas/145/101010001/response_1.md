### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is used to evaluate frame operations by dispatching to the Series implementation column by column.
2. The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` happening in the `evaluate` function when trying to multiply an array `[1, 3]` with `NaTType`.
3. The error occurs when trying to evaluate the expression `op(a, b)` in the `expressions.py` module, specifically in the `_evaluate_standard` function. The error arises due to unsupported operand types for multiplication.
4. The bug is caused by the `column_op` function inside `dispatch_to_series`, where the logic is not correctly handling the operation when one of the operands is `NaTType`. The `column_op` function is constructing a dictionary by iterating over columns, leading to the unsupported multiplication operation between an array and `NaTType`.
  
### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `column_op` function, which handles the element-wise operation column by column, needs to be modified to accommodate the case when one of the operands is `NaTType`. We need to handle the compatibility check for such cases to avoid unsupported operations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iat[i]) if pd.notnull(b.iat[i]) else b.iat[i] for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version:
- For the case where `right` is a `Series` and the `axis` is "columns", the logic inside the `column_op` function has been modified to handle `NaTType` values by checking if the value is not null before applying the operation. 
- This modification ensures that the operation is only applied when the value is not null, avoiding the `TypeError` encountered when trying to multiply an array with `NaTType`.
