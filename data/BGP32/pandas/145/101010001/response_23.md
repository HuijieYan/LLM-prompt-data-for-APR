### Analysis:
The buggy function, `dispatch_to_series`, is responsible for evaluating operations between a DataFrame and either a scalar, another DataFrame, or a Series. The main issue leading to the error is the handling of operations involving a DataFrame and a scalar value like `NaT`.

The error occurs when attempting to perform the operation between a NumPy array (`x`) and a scalar `NaT` in the `masked_arith_op` function. This leads to a `TypeError` due to the unsupported operation between a NumPy array and `NaTType`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the implementation in the `dispatch_to_series` function where it creates a custom `column_op` function based on the type of the `right` input. When the `right` input is a scalar like `NaT`, the implementation of the `column_op` function is not capable of handling the operation correctly, leading to the unsupported operand type error.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `column_op` function to correctly handle the case when the `right` input is a scalar like `NaT`. One way to do this is to check if the `right` input is not a NumPy array and perform the operation accordingly.

### Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected version of the `column_op` function within the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            if not isinstance(b, np.ndarray):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            else:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.item()) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, the `column_op` function now handles the case when the `right` input is not a NumPy array separately and extracts the scalar value from it to perform the operation correctly. This modification helps in resolving the unsupported operand type error when operating on `NaT` with a NumPy array.
