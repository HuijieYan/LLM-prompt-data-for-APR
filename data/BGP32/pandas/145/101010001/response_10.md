### Analysis:
- The error message indicates that there is an issue with the multiplication operation (`*`). Specifically, it mentions that there is an unsupported operand type for multiplication involving a NumPy array and NaT type (Not-a-Time).
- The error occurs at the point where the `dispatch_to_series` function calls `expressions.evaluate`, leading to a chain of function calls resulting in the multiplication operation failing due to the unsupported operand types.
- The `dispatch_to_series` function is supposed to evaluate frame operations by handling different cases for operands and executing the operation column by column.
- The issue seems to arise when dealing with a scalar `right` value of NaT and attempting multiplication with a DataFrame.

### Bug Cause:
1. When the `right` operand is a scalar or NaT, the `column_op` function is defined to perform the operation by iterating over columns. In this case, the `right` value being NaT causes a mismatch in operand types when attempting the multiplication operation.
2. The chain of function calls eventually leads to the `evaluate` function, which then fails to perform the operation due to the unsupported operand types.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `column_op` function to handle the case when the `right` operand is a scalar NaT. We should accommodate this special case to prevent the operation from being processed with incompatible operand types.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        if np.isnat(right):  # Check if right is NaT
            new_data = left.mul(right)  # Handle NaT case directly
        else:
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    if not np.isnat(right):  # Skip evaluation if right is NaT, already handled
        new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this correction, when the `right` operand is NaT (Not-a-Time), the function directly handles the operation rather than trying to iterate over columns with incompatible operand types. This modification should resolve the bug and allow the function to handle the special case of NaT values more gracefully.
