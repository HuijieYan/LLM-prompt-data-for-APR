### Analysis:
The error message indicates a `TypeError` stemming from an unsupported operation involving a `numpy.ndarray` and 'NaTType'. The issue arises in the `dispatch_to_series` function, specifically in the `column_op` part where the function attempts a multiplication operation involving a `numpy.ndarray` and a 'NaTType', which is not supported.

### Potential Error Locations:
The error seems to occur in the nested functions inside the `dispatch_to_series` function, specifically in the `column_op` where the operations are performed column-wise between inputs that might lead to unsupported operations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by trying to perform a multiplication operation between a `numpy.ndarray` and a 'NaTType' (Not a Time) value, resulting in a `TypeError` due to incompatible operand types. This issue arises when handling the arithmetic operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing 'NaT' values.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where 'NaT' values are present in the series during the arithmetic operation. One approach is to identify the 'NaT' values and handle them separately during the calculation to prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if b.iat[i] != 'NaT' else 'NaT' for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns)) if not np.isnat(b[i]) else 'NaT'}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version of the function, when handling the case where the right input is a Series and the axis is "columns", a check is added to see if the value in the Series is `'NaT'`. If it is, the corresponding result in the dictionary is set to `'NaT'`. This modification prevents the unsupported operation issue while dealing with 'NaT' values during the arithmetic operation.
