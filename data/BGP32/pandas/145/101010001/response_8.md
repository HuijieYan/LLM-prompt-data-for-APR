### Analysis:
- The `dispatch_to_series` function is intended to evaluate a frame operation by dispatching column-by-column to the Series implementation.
- The error message indicates a `TypeError` stemming from an unsupported operand type in the `_evaluate_standard` function within `expressions.py` when attempting to perform an arithmetic operation involving a numpy array and `NaTType` (Not a Time).
- The issue seems to arise from the operation between an array and `NaT` which is causing the `TypeError`.

### Bug Location:
- The error is occurring within the `column_op` function where the operation is defined for different cases involving a DataFrame, Series, or scalar value.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by trying to perform an unsupported operation between a numpy array and `NaT` (Not a Time) type which is not allowed.

### Strategy for Fixing:
- To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where an operation involves a numpy array and `NaT` type. We can modify the logic in the `column_op` function to handle this scenario appropriately.

### Correction:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns) if pd.notna(b) else a.shape[0])}

            # Check if each item in b is not NaT before performing the operation

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":

        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns) if pd.notna(b.iloc[i]) else a.shape[0])}
            # Check if each item in b is not NaT before performing the operation

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns) if pd.notna(b.iloc[i]) else a.shape[0])}
            # Check if each item in b is not NaT before performing the operation

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, we have added checks to ensure that the operation is performed only if the item in the numpy array is not `NaT` before proceeding with the computation. This modification prevents the unsupported operand type error that was previously encountered.
