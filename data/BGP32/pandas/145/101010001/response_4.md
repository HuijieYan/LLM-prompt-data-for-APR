### Analysis:
The error arises from the attempt to perform a multiplication operation `*` between a DataFrame and a Series containing 'NaT' (Not a Time) values. The traceback indicates that the issue originates from the `masked_arith_op` function in `array_ops.py`, where the unsupported operation between a NumPy array and `NaTType` (from `pandas._libs.tslibs.nattype`) is attempted. The chain of function calls from the initial error points to the `column_op` function within `__init__.py` in the `ops` module. Specifically, the nested dictionary comprehension within `column_op` does not handle the case of `NaT` values correctly, leading to the TypeError.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the handling of 'NaT' values in the `column_op` function. The operation is not handled properly when one of the operands is 'NaT', resulting in a TypeError when trying to perform arithmetic operations involving 'NaT'.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `column_op` function to handle the case where one of the operands is 'NaT'. The `masked_arith_op` function should be modified to handle the 'NaT' values gracefully, ensuring that the operations are only performed on non-'NaT' elements.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isna(b) else b for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) if not any(pd.isna(b.iloc[:, i])) else b.iloc[:, i] for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if not pd.isna(b.iloc[i]) else b.iloc[i] for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isna(b) else b for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, the `column_op` function now includes conditional checks to handle 'NaT' values appropriately when performing operations on DataFrames and Series. The modifications ensure that operations are only performed on non-'NaT' elements, preventing any unsupported operand type errors.
