### Analysis:
The error message indicates that there is an issue with performing the arithmetic operation of multiplication (`*`) between a NumPy array (`left`) and a `NaT` value (`right`). The error occurs in the `evaluate_standard` function within `expressions.py` due to the unsupported operand types for multiplication.

### Potential Error Location:
The issue is likely originating from the `dispatch_to_series` function, specifically within the `column_op` function where the multiplication operation is being applied between the DataFrame columns and the `NaT` value. The error is likely due to the fact that `NaT` is not a valid operand for arithmetic operations.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `column_op` function is trying to perform arithmetic operations involving the `NaT` value, which is not compatible with NumPy array calculations. This leads to a `TypeError` as NumPy cannot perform arithmetic operations involving `NaT`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the right operand (`b`) is a `NaT` value and ensure that it does not participate in the arithmetic operation. One approach would be to check for `NaT` in the right operand and exclude it from the operation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

        def column_op(a, b):

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns)) if not b.isna().any()}

            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns)) if not pd.isnull(b.iloc[i])}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):

            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns)) if not pd.isnull(b.iloc[0])}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)
    
    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, we added checks to exclude `NaT` values from participating in the arithmetic operations within the `column_op` function. This modification ensures that the arithmetic operation is only performed on valid operands, addressing the `TypeError` that occurred when trying to multiply a NumPy array with `NaT`.
