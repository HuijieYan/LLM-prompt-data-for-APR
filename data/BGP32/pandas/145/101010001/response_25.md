### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates a `TypeError` caused by unsupported operand types for multiplication (`*`) between a numpy array and `NaT` (Not a Time) type.
2. The error occurs inside the `na_arithmetic_op` function, specifically at the line where the multiplication operation is being evaluated using the `op` function.
3. The bug originates in the `dispatch_to_series` function due to the inappropriate handling of different operand types when performing arithmetic operations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the `column_op` function within `dispatch_to_series`. The `column_op` function defines how the arithmetic operation should be applied column-wise within the DataFrame. In the case where the right operand is `NaT`, it fails to handle this scenario properly, leading to the `TypeError` during evaluation.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `column_op` functions to correctly handle the case of `NaT` as the right operand. Specifically, when the right operand is `NaT`, we can directly perform the arithmetic operation with the left operand without any changes.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            if pd.isna(b):  # Check for NaT
                return {i: a.iloc[:, i] for i in range(len(a.columns))}  # Return the left operand
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

After applying the fix above, the function should now handle the case of `NaT` as the right operand appropriately and prevent the `TypeError` that was previously occurring.
