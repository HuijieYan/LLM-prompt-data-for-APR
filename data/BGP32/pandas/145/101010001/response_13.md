### Analysis:
The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is used to evaluate the frame operation `func(left, right)` by dispatching the operation column-by-column to the Series implementation. The error occurs when trying to perform an arithmetic operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing a `NaT` value. The error message indicates that the native types are not compatible for the operation.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by trying to perform an arithmetic operation between a NumPy array (DataFrame) and a `NaT` type (Not a Time). The error occurs in the `masked_arith_op` function when trying to perform the operation between a NumPy array and a `NaTType`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to account for the case when a `NaT` value is encountered during the arithmetic operation. When encountering a `NaT` value, we should handle it appropriately to avoid the unsupported operand type error.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns) if not pd.isnull(b))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns) if not b.isna().any())}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns) if not pd.isnull(b.iloc[i]))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns) if not pd.isnull(b))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, we use `pd.isnull()` or `not b.isna().any()` to check for the presence of `NaT` values before performing the arithmetic operation between a DataFrame and a Series. This way, we avoid the unsupported operand type error.
