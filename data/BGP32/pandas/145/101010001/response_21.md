### 1. Analysis:
The error message indicates that there is an issue with unsupported operand types for the multiplication operation between a numpy array and NaTType. The error occurs when trying to evaluate the operation 'op(a, b)' in the `_evaluate_standard` function of `expressions.py`.

### 2. Potential Error Locations:
The potential error locations are in the `dispatch_to_series` function when calling `expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)`. Specifically, the problem might be related to the generated function `column_op`, where the operation is performed column by column.

### 3. Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `column_op` function generated within the `dispatch_to_series` function does not handle the case where the right operand is NaT correctly. As a result, when the multiplication operation is attempted between a numpy array and the NaT value, it leads to the unsupported operand type error.

### 4. Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `column_op` function within the `dispatch_to_series` function to handle the case where the right operand is NaTType. We can implement a conditional check to perform the operation only if the right operand is not NaT.

### 5. Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function with a modified `column_op` function to handle the case where the right operand is NaT with the multiplication operation:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    # with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            if not pd.isna(b):  # Check if b is NaT
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            return {i: b for i in range(len(a.columns))}  # Return b as is

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, a check is added in the `column_op` function to ensure that the operation is only performed if the right operand is not NaT. If the right operand is NaT, the function simply returns the right operand as is for each column. This modification should fix the unsupported operand type error when operating with NaTType.
