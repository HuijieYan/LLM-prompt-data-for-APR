## Correction Strategy
1. The error message indicates an issue where the operation between a NumPy array and NaTType is not supported.
2. The error occurs in the `na_arithmetic_op` function during the evaluation of the operation. This function handles the evaluation with NumPy arrays.
3. The correction strategy involves handling the operation between NumPy arrays and NaTType gracefully by considering only the non-null elements in the arrays.
4. Update the operation in the `masked_arith_op` function to account for the unsupported operation between a NumPy array and NaTType by considering only the elements that are not NaT.
5. Ensure that the corrected operation in `masked_arith_op` correctly deals with NumPy arrays and NaT values.
6. Verify that the corrected `masked_arith_op` function returns the expected results without raising errors.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            # Handle the operation with NumPy array and NaT values
            mask = ~a.isna() & ~b.isna()
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i][mask], b[mask]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
``` 

By handling the operation with NumPy array and NaT values correctly in the `column_op` function for the case of an ABCSeries, the corrected function should now be able to handle the operation between a DataFrame and a Series with timedelta64[ns] dtype, as described in the failing test case.
