### Analysis
The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is supposed to evaluate frame operation `func(left, right)` by processing column by column and dispatching to the Series implementation. The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` checks the multiplication operation of a DataFrame with a Series containing `NaT` values. The error occurs when attempting to multiply the DataFrame by the Series containing `NaT` values.

The bug seems to be related to the handling of `NaT` values in the DataFrame-Serie multiplication operation. When the scalar or DataFrame to be multiplied contains `NaT` values, the operation fails due to unsupported operand type errors.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function `dispatch_to_series` does not correctly handle operations involving `NaT` values (missing values) in the DataFrame and Series multiplication. When the Series `right` contains `NaT` values, the function fails to perform the multiplication operation as required, resulting in a TypeError.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `dispatch_to_series` function to handle `NaT` values correctly during the multiplication operation. We should check for `NaT` values in the input and avoid performing unsupported operations, ensuring that the operation is consistent across different types of input.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        new_data = expressions.evaluate(func, str_rep, left, right)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        new_data = expressions.evaluate(func, str_rep, left, right)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        new_data = expressions.evaluate(func, str_rep, left, right)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        new_data = expressions.evaluate(func, str_rep, left, right)
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    return new_data
```

By updating the function as shown above, we ensure that the multiplication operation between the DataFrame and the Series containing `NaT` values is handled correctly by `expressions.evaluate()` based on the type of input. This fix should resolve the issue identified in the failing test.
