## Bug Analysis
The `dispatch_to_series` function is designed to evaluate frame operations by dispatching to the Series implementation, column-by-column. However, the bug occurs when trying to perform an operation involving a DataFrame multiplied by a Series with timedelta values (`NaT`). The error arises because the current implementation in the `column_op` function does not handle the case where the right operand is `NaT` properly.

The bug occurs in the `column_op` function when trying to apply the operation on each element of the Series and the DataFrame. The `ops` module does not handle the operation of multiplying a numpy array by `NaT` (Not-a-Time), which results in a `TypeError` due to unsupported operand types.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the `column_op` function to handle the case where the right operand is `NaT`. One way to resolve this issue is to check for `NaT` values in the right operand array and replace them with an appropriate representation that is compatible with the operation.

## The Corrected Function
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            if isinstance(b, Timedelta) and b.isnat:
                b = np.nan
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

## The bug-fixed function explanation
- In the corrected `column_op` function for the `dispatch_to_series` function, a check is introduced to handle the case where the right operand `b` is a `Timedelta` value (`NaT`). If the `b` value is `NaT`, it is replaced with `np.nan` before applying the operation between the DataFrame `a` and the modified right operand `b`.
- This modification allows the operation to be applied between a DataFrame and a Series containing timedelta values, preventing the `TypeError` that occurs with unsupported operand types.
