## Analysis
The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is designed to evaluate frame operations by dispatching the computation column-by-column to the Series implementation. The error occurs when trying to multiply a DataFrame `df` with a Series `ser`. The specific error message indicates that the operation fails due to an unsupported operand type for multiplication, involving 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'.

The process involves evaluating the operation by iterating over columns and applying the operation to the corresponding elements. The bug occurs when attempting to perform the operation with a scalar value 'NaT'. This scalar value is of type 'NaTType', which is causing the unsupported operand type error during the multiplication operation.

## Bug Identification
The bug lies in the method of handling the 'right' input, which can be a scalar value or a DataFrame/Series. When 'right' is a scalar and represents a null value, it is converted to an 'NaT' scalar value which the current implementation of the function does not handle correctly, leading to the error.

## Bug Explanation
- In the failing test case, the 'right' input is a Series `ser` containing 'NaT' values of timedelta64[ns] type.
- Once 'right' is extracted in the buggy function, it gets converted to an 'NaT' scalar value using `lib.item_from_zerodim(right)`.
- During the evaluation of the operation, the function tries to perform the operation on the DataFrame `left` and the 'NaT' scalar value, which results in the unsupported operand type error.

## Proposed Fix
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where 'right' is an 'NaT' scalar value. Since 'NaT' is a special null value for pandas representing missing values in datetime operations, we can modify the behavior of handling 'right' specifically in this case.

We can update the function to check if 'right' is 'NaT' and handle it appropriately by returning NaNs in the result. This way, the multiplication operation will not error out when encountering a scalar 'NaT' value during the computation.

## The corrected code
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {"index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        if lib.is_scalar(right) and right == np.timedelta64('NaT'):
            new_data = left.apply(lambda column: np.nan)
        else:
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    if 'new_data' in locals():
        return new_data

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By updating the code to recognize 'NaT' as a special case when 'right' is a scalar, the corrected function will handle the multiplication operation with DataFrame and scalar 'NaT' values without raising an error. This modification ensures the correct behavior when dealing with missing value representations in pandas operations.
