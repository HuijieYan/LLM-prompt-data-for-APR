## Analysis
The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is designed to handle different cases based on the type of the `right` input parameter and dispatch to corresponding column-wise operations. However, the error occurs when trying to perform a multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing `NaT` values.

The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'` in the `_evaluate_standard` function within expressions.py. This error occurs due to the unsupported multiplication operation between a numpy array and NaT values.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the way the function handles the operation when the `right` input parameter is a Series containing `NaT` values. The current implementation does not properly handle this case, leading to a TypeError during the evaluation of the operation.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `column_op` function for the case where `right` is a Series containing `NaT` values. In this case, we need to check for `NaT` values before performing the operation and handle them appropriately.

## Updated Corrected Version
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns)}}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns)}}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b[i]) if not pd.isna(b[i]) else b[i] for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isna(b) else b for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this fix, the function will properly handle the case where the `right` input parameter is a Series containing `NaT` values and perform the operation accordingly.
