The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is causing a `TypeError` because the function is trying to perform a multiplication operation between a NumPy array and a `NaTType` (Not a Time) value. This occurs when the `left` DataFrame is multiplied by the `right` Series containing `NaT` values.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `dispatch_to_series` function to handle the operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing `NaT` values. We can update the function to check for `NaT` values in the Series and perform the operation only on non-`NaT` elements.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Check if the right input is a Series with NaT values
    if isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and right.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]' and right.isna().any():
        right = right.where(~right.isna(), np.nan)  # Replace NaT values with NaN

    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compatibility with cases with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing `NaT` values correctly.

Please replace the existing `dispatch_to_series` function with this corrected version, and the failing test case should now pass successfully.
