## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is intended to evaluate column-wise operations between a DataFrame and another DataFrame, scalar, or Series. The error occurs when trying to perform the operation `df * ser` with a DataFrame `df` and a Series `ser`. The error message reveals that the issue happens during the evaluation of the operation within the `_evaluate_standard` function due to unsupported operand types.

The code snippet responsible for this issue is in the `column_op` function defined within the `dispatch_to_series` function. Specifically, when the `right` input is a Series and the `axis` is not "columns", the calculation is performed incorrectly, leading to the type error.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the behavior of the `column_op` function based on the conditions mentioned in the `dispatch_to_series` function. Specifically, when `right` is a Series and `axis` is not "columns", the operation should be performed row-by-row. This adjustment will ensure that the correct operation is carried out between the DataFrame and the Series.

## Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This correction ensures that when a Series `right` is passed, and the `axis` is not "columns", the operation will be performed row-by-row, fixing the type error encountered during the failing test scenario.
