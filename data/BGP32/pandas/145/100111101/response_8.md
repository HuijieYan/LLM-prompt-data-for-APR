The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function stems from the incorrect handling of timedelta values during a multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing timedelta values.

### Bug Explanation:
The error arises due to the presence of NaT (Not a Time) values in the Series `ser` which is of type `timedelta64[ns]`. When trying to perform the multiplication operation `df * ser`, the function encounters issues handling the NaT values, resulting in a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'`.

### Fix Strategy:
To resolve this issue, we need to modify the `column_op` function inside the `dispatch_to_series` function to properly handle the NaT values. We will check for NaT values in the Series and exclude them from the multiplication operation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns)) if not pd.isna(b.iloc[i])}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns)) if not pd.isna(b.iloc[i])}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this corrected version, the `column_op` function now includes a check to skip processing of NaT values during operations, ensuring that the multiplication between the DataFrame and the Series with timedelta values proceeds smoothly.
