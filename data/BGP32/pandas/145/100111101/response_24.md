The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is causing an error when trying to perform an arithmetic operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing timedelta64 values. The error occurs due to the mismatch in handling NaT (Not a Time) values in the Series with the DataFrame.

The bug lies in the `column_op` function within the `dispatch_to_series` function. The current implementation does not handle the case where the Series contains NaT values correctly, leading to a TypeError during the evaluation of the operation.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `column_op` implementation to handle NaT values correctly. Specifically, we will check for NaT values in the Series and replace them with NaN before performing the arithmetic operation.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        def column_op(a, b):
            b_cleaned = b.mask(b == pd.NaT, np.nan)  # Convert NaT to NaN
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b_cleaned) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This updated implementation now correctly handles NaT values in the Series by converting them to NaN before performing the arithmetic operation. This change ensures compatibility between the DataFrame and the Series containing timedelta64 values, addressing the TypeError that was occurring during evaluation.

After applying this fix, the `dispatch_to_series` function should pass the failing test case provided.
