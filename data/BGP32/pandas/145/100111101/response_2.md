### Analysis
The bug occurs when trying to perform an arithmetic operation involving a DataFrame and a Series with `NaT` values. The error arises in the `evaluate` function due to unsupported operand types for multiplication involving a numpy array and `NaTType`.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because when the arithmetic operation is performed, the DataFrame and Series are not handled correctly with `NaT` values. This results in the unsupported operand type error during the multiplication operation.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the Series contains `NaT` values appropriately. We can modify the `column_op` function to skip the `NaT` values during the operation. By doing this, we ensure that the arithmetic operation is not performed on incompatible types causing the error.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns)) if not pd.isna(b.iloc[i])}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns)) if not pd.isna(b)}

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

Now, the corrected function should handle `NaT` values appropriately in the operation, ensuring the correct behavior when multiplying a DataFrame with a Series containing `NaT`s.
