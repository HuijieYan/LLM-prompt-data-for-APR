The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is causing a `TypeError` due to an unsupported operand type during arithmetic operations. The issue arises when trying to multiply a DataFrame with a Series containing `NaT` values. The function attempts the operation directly on the `numpy.ndarray` representation of the Series, leading to the unsupported operand type error.

To fix this issue:
1. We should handle the operation with `NaT` values more gracefully by properly checking and handling these situations.
2. Ensure that the operation between the DataFrame and the Series containing `NaT` values is done correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if pd.notna(b.iloc[i]) else b.iloc[i] for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This correction checks if the `NaT` values exist in the Series and handles them appropriately during arithmetic operations with the DataFrame.

After applying this fix, the `dispatch_to_series` function should now pass the failing test related to arithmetic operations involving timedelta(`NaT`) values within a DataFrame.
