The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function stems from the fact that the function is not handling the operation between a DataFrame and a Series with dtype 'timedelta64[ns]' correctly. The issue arises when trying to evaluate the operation using the `expressions.evaluate` function, leading to a `TypeError` due to an unsupported operation with 'NaTType'.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic in the `column_op` function inside the `dispatch_to_series` function. Specifically, we should properly handle the case where `right` is a Series with 'timedelta64[ns]' dtype and the axis is either not specified or set to 'columns'. We need to ensure that the operation is correctly applied element-wise between the DataFrame columns and the Series elements.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)

    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and (axis is None or axis == "columns"):
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version includes the necessary adjustments to handle the operation correctly between a DataFrame and a Series with 'timedelta64[ns]' dtype. It ensures that the operation is applied element-wise when multiplying a DataFrame by a Series in the specified conditions. This should resolve the issue identified in the failing test case provided.

Please test this corrected version with the failing test case to confirm that the bug has been fixed.
