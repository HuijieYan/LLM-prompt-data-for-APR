### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs due to the operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing `NaT` values within the `dispatch_to_series` function. The function fails to handle the operation correctly, leading to a TypeError during evaluation, as shown in the failing test.

The issue arises when trying to perform a multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing `NaT` values. The implementation in the function does not properly handle this case, resulting in the TypeError mentioned in the error message.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function `dispatch_to_series` can handle operations involving `NaT` values correctly. Specifically, when dealing with `NaT`, the function should properly propagate these values and perform the operation accordingly.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function that should pass the failing test:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        if isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
            if axis == "columns":
                assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
                right = right.reindex(left.columns)
            else:
                assert right.index.equals(left.index)
                right = right.reindex(left.index)
        
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This correction includes proper reindexing of the Series `right` depending on the axis, before performing the column-wise operation. This ensures that the operation between the DataFrame and Series with `NaT` values is handled correctly.
