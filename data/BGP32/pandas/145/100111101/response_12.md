### Analysis
The `dispatch_to_series` function is responsible for evaluating frame operations by dispatching them to the Series implementation. The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` is testing the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing `'NaT'` values. The error occurs in the multiplication operation due to the unsupported operand types for multiplication: `'numpy.ndarray'` and `'NaTType'`.

### Issues
1. The function is not handling the multiplication between a DataFrame and a Series with `'NaT'` values correctly.
2. The logic inside the `dispatch_to_series` to handle different input types is not covering cases where there are `'NaT'` values present.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the code not handling the specific case of multiplication between a DataFrame and a Series containing `'NaT'` values, leading to unsupported operand types error during evaluation.

### Proposed Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `column_op` function to handle the case where the right operand is a Series with `'NaT'` values. For this case, we should check for `'NaT'` values in the Series and perform the operation only for non-'NaT' elements.

### Corrected Function
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns)) if b.iloc[i] != pd.NaT}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns)) if b.iloc[i] != pd.NaT}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function should now handle the case of multiplying a DataFrame with a Series containing `'NaT'` values correctly.
