### Analysis:
The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to an unsupported operand type for multiplication between a numpy array and NaT (Not a Time) type. The error is raised when attempting the operation `op(a, b)` in the `_evaluate_standard` function from `expressions.py` module. The root cause of the issue is the presence of a NaT value while performing arithmetic operations within the `dispatch_to_series` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when the `dispatch_to_series` function encounters a NaT value while trying to perform a column-wise operation between a DataFrame and a Series. The error happens due to the inability to perform arithmetic multiplication between a numpy array and a NaT type.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the right operand is NaT in the `column_op` function within the `dispatch_to_series` function. We can skip performing the operation when encountering a NaT value by adding a check to exclude NaT values before performing the operation.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns)) if not pd.isnull(b.iloc[i])}  # Exclude NaT

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns)) if not pd.isnull(b.iloc[0])}  # Exclude NaT

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this fix, the corrected `dispatch_to_series` function will exclude NaT values from the column-wise operations, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring during arithmetic operations involving NaT values.
