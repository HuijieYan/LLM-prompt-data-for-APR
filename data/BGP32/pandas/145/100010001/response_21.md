### Analysis:
The error message indicates a `TypeError` when trying to perform the operation between a numpy array and `NaT` type (Not-a-Time). The error occurs in the `_evaluate_standard` function of `expressions.py` which is called during the evaluation process in the `dispatch_to_series` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the fact that there is no handling for the case where the right operand is `NaT` (Not-a-Time) type in the `column_op` function within the `dispatch_to_series` function. This causes the operation to fail when trying to apply the operation between a numpy array and `NaT`.

### Fix Strategy:
We need to handle the case where the right operand is `NaT` in the `column_op` function to prevent the error. In this case, we can filter out the missing values (`NaT`) before applying the operation to avoid the `TypeError`.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    def filtered_op(a, b):
        valid_indices = ~b.isna()
        return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i][valid_indices], b[valid_indices]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(filtered_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected function, the `filtered_op` function is introduced, which filters out the missing values (`NaT`) from the right operand before applying the operation. This prevents the `TypeError` that was occurring earlier.
