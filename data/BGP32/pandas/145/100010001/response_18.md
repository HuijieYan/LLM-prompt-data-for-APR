The error message indicates a TypeError occurring in the `masked_arith_op` function within the `array_ops.py` file. The specific operation causing the error is multiplication `*` between a numpy array `[1, 3]` and `NaTType`, which is not supported.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The error occurs when trying to perform element-wise multiplication between a numpy array and a `NaTType` (missing value representation in pandas). 
2. The function `masked_arith_op` is designed to handle failed arithmetic operations by attempting them again only on the non-null elements of the input arrays, but it is encountering a `NaTType`, which is causing the TypeError.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify how the function `dispatch_to_series` handles operations involving `NaTType`. Specifically, we need to handle the special case when one of the operands is a `NaTType` to prevent the TypeError.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later
        # Handle the special case of one operand being NaTType
        if np.issubdtype(left.dtypes[0], np.datetime64) and pd.isna(right.dtype):
            def column_op(a, b):
                result = a.copy()
                result[:] = np.nan
                return result
        else:
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version of the function includes a special case check to handle scenarios where one of the operands is `NaTType`. In this case, the corresponding operation is performed to replace the `NaT` values with `NaN` to avoid the unsupported operation error.
