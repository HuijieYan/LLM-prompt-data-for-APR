### Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `dispatch_to_series` function in the check for when the `right` input is a NaT (Not a Time) value. The error message indicates a `TypeError` caused by an unsupported operand type for multiplication (`*`) involving a NumPy array and a NaTType. This error is triggered during the evaluation of the operation in the `expressions.evaluate` function, consequently calling the `_evaluate_standard` function, which fails due to the unsupported operation between a NumPy array and NaTType.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The issue seems to be within the `column_op` function defined in the else block when checking if the `right` input is a NaT value.
2. The error arises from trying to perform the multiplication operation (`*`) between a NumPy array and a NaTType.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the inability to perform arithmetic operations involving a NumPy array and a NaT (Not a Time) scalar value, leading to a TypeError.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the special case where `right` is a NaT scalar value when performing the arithmetic operation within the `column_op` function. This involves skipping the operation when encountering a NaT value and filling the result with NaN in those cases.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns)) if not pd.isna(b)}
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, we modified the `column_op` function to skip the operation when encountering a NaN value in the right operand, thus preventing the TypeError caused by attempting to operate on a NumPy array and a NaT value.
