### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'` occurring while performing an arithmetic operation involving a NumPy array and NaT (Not-a-Time) type.
2. The error message is specifically pointing towards the line in the code where the multiplication operation (`*`) is being applied to the NumPy array and NaT type.
3. The `masked_arith_op` function within the `pandas/core/ops/array_ops.py` module triggers the error due to the unsupported operation between a NumPy array and NaTType when the `op` function is applied to the elements of the arrays.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by attempting to perform an arithmetic operation that involves a NumPy array and the NaT type, which is not a valid operation and raises a `TypeError`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where a NumPy array is operated with NaT separately and avoid performing the arithmetic operation in such cases. This can be achieved by modifying the `column_op` function in the `dispatch_to_series` function to handle this specific scenario and prevent the operation that leads to the error.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            if b is pd.NaT:
                return {i: pd.NaT for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, the `column_op` function now explicitly handles the case where the `right` input is `pd.NaT` (NaT), and in such cases, it returns a dictionary with NaT values without attempting the arithmetic operation. This change ensures that the operation between a NumPy array and NaT type is avoided, preventing the `TypeError`.
