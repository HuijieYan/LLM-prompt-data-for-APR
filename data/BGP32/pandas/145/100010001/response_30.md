### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the function `dispatch_to_series` is failing when trying to perform an arithmetic operation involving a numpy array and a `NaT` value (Not a Time) using the multiplication operator `*`. This error occurs during the evaluation of the expression in the function `evalute`, specifically in the `_evaluate_standard` method when it attempts the operation `op(a, b)`.

### Bug Location:
The bug is likely located in the `dispatch_to_series` function, as it is responsible for handling various cases of operands for arithmetic operations between a DataFrame and a scalar, DataFrame, or Series. The error seems to occur due to the handling of `NaT` values in the `column_op` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `NaT` value when attempting the multiplication operation with a numpy array. This combination raises a `TypeError` because the operation is not supported between a numpy array and `NaT`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the right operand is `NaT` in the `column_op` function. This can be achieved by skipping the operation when encountering a `NaT` value in the right operand.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            if b is pd.NaT:
                return {i: b for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    # Remaining code remains the same

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By updating the `column_op` function to check for `NaT` values and return `NaT` without performing the operation, we prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when a numpy array is multiplied by `NaT`. This fix addresses the specific issue identified in the error message.
