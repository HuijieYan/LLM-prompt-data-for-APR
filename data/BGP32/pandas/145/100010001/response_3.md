The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is due to the handling of the special case when trying to perform an arithmetic operation between a DataFrame and a Series with NaT values.

The error message indicates that the issue occurs when trying to perform the multiplication operation between a DataFrame `left` and a Series `right` with NaT values. The error arises in the `na_arithmetic_op` function at the `result = expressions.evaluate(op, str_rep, left, right, **eval_kwargs)` line, specifically when calling `_evaluate_standard(op, op_str, a, b, reversed=reversed)` function.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that when performing the operation between a DataFrame and a Series with NaT values, we skip the NaT values and only consider the non-null elements.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns)) if not pd.isna(b[i])}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, when dealing with the case where `right` is an `ABCSeries`, we iterate over the columns but only perform the operation if the corresponding value in the `b` Series is not null (`pd.isna(b[i])`). This ensures that the operation skips over the NaT values, preventing the TypeError when trying to perform the operation on 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'.
