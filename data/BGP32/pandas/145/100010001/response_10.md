### Analysis:
The error message indicates that there is an issue with the operation involving a numpy array and a 'NaTType', which is not supported.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the function trying to perform a multiplication operation between a numpy array and 'NaT' (Not a Time) type, which is not a valid operation.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the right operand is 'NaT' specifically, and make sure that the operation between a numpy array and 'NaT' is not executed.

### Corrected Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    # with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        # Handling the case when right operand is 'NaT', avoid the operation
        if np.issubdtype(right.dtype, np.datetime64) and pd.isna(right[0]):
            return left

        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected function includes a check for the `right` operand being 'NaT' to avoid performing the operation if the operand is 'NaT'. This ensures that the multiplication operation is only carried out when the right operand is not 'NaT', fixing the bug causing the TypeError.
