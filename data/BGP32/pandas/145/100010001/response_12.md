The bug in the provided function `dispatch_to_series` arises due to the `NaT` values being processed in a multiplication operation involving a DataFrame and a Series with `dtype='timedelta64[ns]'`.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `NaT` (Not-a-Time) values are present in the Series during the arithmetic operation. One way to address this is to modify the implementation of the `column_op` function in the `dispatch_to_series` function to check for `NaT` values when performing the multiplication operation.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function to handle the `NaT` values more gracefully:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if not pd.isnull(b.iloc[i]) else pd.NaT for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isnull(b) else pd.NaT for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version adjusts the behavior for handling `NaT` values when performing arithmetic operations between a DataFrame and a Series, specifically in the case of multiplication. The changes made ensure that the `NaT` values are properly handled during the operation, preventing the `TypeError` that was previously raised.
