### Analysis:
1. The function `dispatch_to_series` is designed to evaluate an operation between a DataFrame and either a scalar, another DataFrame, or a Series. It utilizes the `expressions.evaluate` function to perform the actual operation.
2. The error message indicates a `TypeError` occurring due to unsupported operand types for multiplication ('numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType').
3. The issue arises in the `na_arithmetic_op` function within the `expressions` module, specifically in the `masked_arith_op` function when trying to operate on elements of `xrav` and `y` arrays.
4. This error occurs because the function does not handle the case when one of the operands (in this case, `NaT`) is not a valid operand for the arithmetic operation.
5. To fix the bug, we need to implement logic to handle such cases where `NaT` is encountered during the arithmetic operation.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right):
        # Handling scalar right operand
        new_data = left.apply(lambda column: func(column, right))
    else:
        # Handling DataFrame and Series cases
        # Note: Direct use of apply along the appropriate axis
        if isinstance(right, (ABCDataFrame, ABCSeries)):
            axis = 0 if axis == "columns" else 1
            new_data = left.apply(lambda column: func(column, right), axis=axis)
        else:
            raise NotImplementedError(right)

    return new_data
```

### Explanation:
1. In the corrected version, we utilize the `apply` function on the DataFrame `left` to apply the arithmetic operation `func` between each column and the `right` operand.
2. We determine the appropriate axis based on the value of the `axis` parameter, ensuring correct column-wise or row-wise operations.
3. This fix ensures that operations are only performed when the right operand is a scalar or DataFrame/Series, preventing the unsupported operand type error encountered with `NaT`.

By applying this bug fix, the function should now handle the arithmetic operations correctly and avoid the TypeError due to unsupported operand types.
