### Bug Analysis:
The error message indicates a "TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'". This error occurs when trying to perform a multiplication operation between a numpy array ('numpy.ndarray') and a NaT type ('NaTType').

Looking at the runtime values and types provided, we can see that the function `dispatch_to_series` is trying to perform an operation between a DataFrame `left` and a Series `right`. The problem arises when attempting to evaluate the multiplication operation `<built-in function mul>` between elements of the DataFrame and the NaT values in the Series.

The issue seems to be in the `column_op` function inside the `dispatch_to_series` function, specifically in the case when `right` is a Series and the axis is not explicitly specified as "columns".

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `column_op` function to handle the case when `right` is a Series and the axis is not "columns". We can modify the function to check for the NaT values in the Series and handle them appropriately.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        if axis != "columns":
            assert right.index.equals(left.index)

            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if not pd.isna(b.iloc[i]) else b.iloc[i] for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        else:
            assert right.index.equals(left.index)

            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By updating the `column_op` function to handle NaT values appropriately, we can ensure that the multiplication operation between the DataFrame and the Series works correctly even with NaT values in the Series.
