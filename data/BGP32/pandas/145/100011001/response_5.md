### Bug Explanation
The error message indicates a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'`, which implies that there is an issue with performing the multiplication operation between a numpy array (`'numpy.ndarray'`) and a `NaT` (Not a Time) type (`'NaTType'`).

In the buggy function `dispatch_to_series`, the problem arises when trying to evaluate the operation between the DataFrame `left` and the Series `right`. It can be observed that the `left` DataFrame contains values of type `int`, while the `right` Series contains `NaT` values. This type mismatch leads to the TypeError during the multiplication operation in the evaluation process.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To address the bug, we need to handle the case when the operation involves multiplication between a DataFrame and a Series with `NaT` values. One way to handle this is to check for `NaT` values in the Series `right` and replace them with a value that is compatible for multiplication with integer values.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is a corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function that handles the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series with `NaT` values:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if not pd.isnull(b.iloc[i]) else b.iloc[i] for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns)) if not pd.isnull(b)}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version includes handling `NaT` values in the Series `right` before performing the multiplication operation with the DataFrame `left`. This should resolve the TypeError encountered in the failing test case.
