### Bug Analysis:
The error message indicates that the bug occurs when trying to perform an arithmetic operation (multiplication) between a DataFrame `left` and a Series `right` with elements of type `NaT` (Not a Time) in the Series. In this case, the specific error is "`TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'`".

Looking at the runtime values and types of variables:
- `right` is a Series containing NaT values.
- The `func` is a multiplication function.
- `left` is a DataFrame with numeric values.
- The `axis` is specified as `'columns'`.
- The operation is performed on each column of the DataFrame (`left`) with the corresponding element in the Series (`right`).

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because when performing the operation between the DataFrame and the Series, the operation is trying to apply the multiplication directly with the `NaT` type, which is not supported.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the Series `right` contains `NaT` values. One common approach is to ignore performing the operation on `NaT` values and keep them as `NaT` in the resulting DataFrame.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if not pd.isnull(b.iloc[i]) else pd.NaT for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isnull(b) else pd.NaT for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this fix, the corrected function will handle the `NaT` values in the Series `right` by not performing the operation and keeping them as `NaT` in the resulting DataFrame.
