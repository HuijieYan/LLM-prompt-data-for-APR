### Bug Analysis
The error message indicates that there is an issue with the multiplication operation between a numpy array and a NaT (Not-a-Time) value. Specifically, the error occurs in the `masked_arith_op` function, where the operation `op(xrav[mask], y)` is causing a `TypeError` due to unsupported operand types.

In the context of the failing test, the `dispatch_to_series` function is being called with a DataFrame `left` and a Series `right`, where `right` contains NaT values of `timedelta64[ns]` type. This triggers the multiplication operation (`<built-in function mul`) between the DataFrame and the Series, leading to the error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the operation is multiplication (`*`) between a DataFrame and a Series containing NaT values. The fix involves modifying the `masked_arith_op` function to handle this specific scenario appropriately, ensuring that the operation is performed correctly without raising a `TypeError` due to unsupported operand types.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            result = a.copy()  # Make a copy to preserve original data
            for i in range(len(a.columns)):
                result.iloc[:, i] = func(a.iloc[:, i], b)
            return result
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version handles the case of multiplication between a DataFrame and a Series with NaT values by creating a copy of the DataFrame and performing the operation column-wise without raising a `TypeError`. This should address the bug and make the failing test pass.
