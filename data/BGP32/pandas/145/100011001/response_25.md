The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is causing a `TypeError` when trying to perform an arithmetic operation (in this case, multiplication) between a DataFrame and a Series containing `NaT` values. The error message indicates that the operation is not supported due to unsupported operand types for multiplication.

The root cause of the bug lies in the `column_op` function where the multiplication operation is being performed column-wise between the DataFrame and the Series. When encountering `NaT` values in the Series, it causes a `TypeError` because the operation is not defined for the DataFrame and `NaTType`.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the right operand (`b`) contains `NaT` values differently. We can modify the `column_op` function to check for `NaT` values and handle them accordingly by performing element-wise operations only where both operands are valid.

Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        def column_op(a, b):
            # Handle 'NaT' values in the Series
            result = {}
            for i in range(len(a.columns)):
                # Check for 'NaT' values
                mask = ~(b.isna())
                result[i] = np.where(mask, func(a.iloc[:, i], b), np.nan)
            return result

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this modification, the `column_op` function now checks for `NaT` values in the Series before performing the arithmetic operation, ensuring that the operation is only applied where both operands are valid. This should fix the `TypeError` caused by the unsupported operation between a DataFrame and `NaTType`.
