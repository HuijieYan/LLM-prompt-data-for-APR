### Bug Analysis
The error message states "TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'". This error occurs in the `masked_arith_op` function when trying to perform the arithmetic operation `*` on a numpy array and NaT (Not-a-Time) type.

Looking at the runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables, we can see that the issue arises when the function `dispatch_to_series` is called with a DataFrame `left`, a Series `right`, and the operation `*`. The code attempts to perform column-wise operations on the DataFrame and Series.

The problem is in the `column_op` function defined within the `dispatch_to_series` function. In the case where `right` is a Series and `axis != "columns"`, the code tries to perform the operation on each column of the DataFrame `left` and the Series `right`. However, due to the mismatch in dimensions between the DataFrame columns and the Series, the operation fails.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the `column_op` function to handle the broadcasting correctly when `right` is a Series and `axis != "columns"`. We should align the Series with the DataFrame indices and perform the operation.

### Corrected Version
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        
        # Align the Series indices with the DataFrame indices
        right_aligned = right.reindex(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right_aligned)
    return new_data
``` 

By aligning the Series `right` with the DataFrame `left` indices before performing the operation in the `column_op` function, we ensure that broadcasting is handled correctly, fixing the bug.
