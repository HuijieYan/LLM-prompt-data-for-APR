### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs when performing an arithmetic operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing NaT values. The error message indicates that the operation is trying to multiply a numpy.ndarray and a NaTType, causing a TypeError.

In the buggy function `dispatch_to_series`, the problem arises in the case where `right` is a Series and the operation is performed column-by-column. The bug is specifically in the `column_op` function defined within `dispatch_to_series`, where the operation is attempted between the columns of the DataFrame (`a.iloc[:, i]`) and the values of the Series (`b.iloc[i]`), resulting in the TypeError due to NaT values.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the operation between column values of the DataFrame and the Series is performed in the `column_op` function. We should handle the NaT values appropriately to prevent the TypeError.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if pd.notna(b.iloc[i]) else np.nan for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By adding a check for NaN values in the `column_op` function when operating between DataFrame columns and Series values, we can handle the NaT values appropriately and avoid the TypeError that was occurring.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases.
