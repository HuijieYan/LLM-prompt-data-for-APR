### Bug Analysis
The bug is occurring because in the `column_op` function, when processing a DataFrame and a Series with `axis='columns'`, it is trying to access the elements of the Series using `b.iloc[i]`, which is causing the error with `NaTType`. The Series `b` contains NaT values, which are causing issues with the multiplication operation.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the `column_op` function to handle the case where a DataFrame is being multiplied by a Series with `axis='columns'` correctly. We should iterate through the columns of the DataFrame and apply the operation to each column element-wise with the respective Series element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # Iterate over DataFrame columns and apply element-wise operation with Series values
        new_data = {}
        for i, col in enumerate(left.columns):
            new_data[col] = func(left[col], right)
        
        return pd.DataFrame(new_data)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By updating the `column_op` function to correctly handle the case of multiplying a DataFrame with a Series along the columns, we can avoid the TypeError caused by the NaTType values.
