### Bug Analysis
The error message indicates that the operation between an ndarray and NaT (Not-a-Time) type is unsupported, leading to a `TypeError`. The buggy function is `dispatch_to_series`, specifically at the point where the `evaluate` method is called from `expressions`. The issue arises when the operation involves a Series with NaT values.

- The input parameters consist of a DataFrame `left`, a Series `right`, and a function `func` that represents multiplication.
- The Series `right` contains NaT values, which are causing the TypeError during evaluation.
- The code tries to perform the operation element-wise between the DataFrame and Series, leading to the error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the Series `right` contains NaT values. Since operations involving NaT could result in unsupported operations like the multiplication with an ndarray, we need to address this scenario before performing the operation.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    # with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            if b.hasnans:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if not pd.isna(b.iloc[i]) else np.nan for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            else:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

The updated version handles the case where the Series `right` contains NaT values by checking if there are NaN values in the Series element before applying the operation. If NaT is encountered, it replaces the result with np.nan instead of attempting the operation causing the TypeError.
