### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs due to the TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'. This error happens when trying to perform a multiplication operation between a numpy array and NaT (Not a Time) type.

In the provided buggy function `dispatch_to_series`, the error is happening inside the `na_arithmetic_op` function when trying to evaluate the operation using `expressions.evaluate`. The issue arises when the function encounters an operation with a numpy array (a) and NaT (b).

One specific problematic code block is in the `column_op` function, where the operation is applied column-wise to the DataFrame. In the line that calculates the result for each index i:
```python
return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
```
The function is trying to apply the operation element-wise between the columns of DataFrame a and the elements of Series b. However, when b is NaT, it leads to the mentioned TypeError.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to handle the NaT values appropriately when performing element-wise operations. One approach is to check for NaT values in b before applying the operation.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if not pd.isna(b.iloc[i]) else np.nan for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isna(b.iloc[i]) else np.nan for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This correction includes adding a check for `pd.isna` to handle the case of NaT values in the Series b before applying the operation. This modification ensures that the operation is only performed where the values are not NaT.

After applying this fix, the TypeError due to unsupported operand types should be resolved.
