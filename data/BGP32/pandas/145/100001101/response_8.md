The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is likely related to the handling of the `right` input in different cases. In Case 1, the issue arises when `right` is a Series and `axis` is set to `'columns'`. The function fails to correctly apply the function `func` to the columns of the DataFrame `left` and the Series `right`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the implementation of the function to appropriately handle the case when `right` is a Series and `axis` is set to `'columns'`.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)
    
    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version includes a modified handling of the case when `right` is a Series and `axis` is set to `'columns'`. The function should now correctly apply the function `func` to the columns of `left` and the Series `right`, as expected in the failing test case.
