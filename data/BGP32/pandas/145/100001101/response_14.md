The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function arises from the fact that the input parameter `b` is a pandas Series containing `NaT` values, which are not recognized as scalars by the current implementation. As a result, the conditional check for scalar values fails, leading to incorrect handling of `b` in the subsequent code blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to handle `NaT` values as scalars, ensuring that they are processed correctly in the function. One way to achieve this is by explicitly checking for `NaT` values and converting them to `np.nan`, which can be handled as a scalar value.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    
    if pd.isna(right):
        right = np.nan

    def column_op(a, b):
        return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    
    return new_data
```

In the fixed version, we explicitly handle `NaT` values by converting them to `np.nan` before passing them to the `column_op` function. This ensures that the function correctly identifies `NaT` values as scalars and processes them accordingly.

By making this modification, the `dispatch_to_series` function should now handle inputs with `NaT` values correctly and produce the expected output based on the provided runtime and expected values.
