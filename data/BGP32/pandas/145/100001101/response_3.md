The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function arises from the mismatch in types between the expected input and actual input. In the provided runtime input values, `right` is a Series with a `timedelta64[ns]` dtype, while the function expects to handle it as a scalar or DataFrame. This leads to the type error encountered during execution.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to handle Series input correctly. We should modify the logic to account for `right` being a Series and adjust the column-wise operation accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
    
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
   
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index) 
        
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version now correctly handles the case where `right` is a Series by comparing its index with `left` and performing row-wise operations accordingly. This should resolve the type error encountered before.
