After analyzing the provided buggy function and the runtime input/output values, as well as the expected input/output values, we can identify the cause of the bug. 

The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function occurs when handling a Series right input with an axis of 'columns'. The function attempts to perform an operation row-by-row, which leads to a misalignment when trying to access the index of the right Series, resulting in the mismatch between the expected and actual outputs.

To fix this bug, we need to correct the way the function processes the `right` input when it is a Series with an axis specified as 'columns'. Specifically, we need to adjust how the operations are applied when handling such cases to ensure proper alignment between the DataFrame and the Series.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, for the case where `right` is an ABCSeries with `axis='columns'`, we ensure that the index alignment is correct between the left DataFrame and the right Series by checking `right.index.equals(left.index)`. This adjustment allows the function to correctly handle column-wise operations between a DataFrame and a Series.
