The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function arises from the mismatch of data types between the `right` input parameter (which is a Series containing `NaT` values of type `timedelta64[ns]`) and the function's internal handling of the `right` variable. 

The function attempts to convert a Series with `NaT` values of type `timedelta64[ns]` into a scalar using `lib.item_from_zerodim(right)`. This causes the subsequent calculation with `func(a.iloc[:, i], b)` to fail due to the mismatch in data types.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the `right` variable properly when it contains `NaT` values of type `timedelta64[ns]`. We should ensure that the data types are compatible for the operation being performed.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    if isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and right.dtypes == 'timedelta64[ns]':
        right = right.fillna(pd.Timedelta(0))

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version checks if the `right` Series contains `timedelta64[ns]` values and replaces them with `pd.Timedelta(0)` to ensure compatibility with the operation. This fix should address the bug and ensure that the function behaves as expected.
