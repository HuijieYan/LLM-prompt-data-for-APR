### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function arises from the way the `column_op` function is defined within the conditional branches. In the case where `right` is a Series and `axis` is not specified as "columns," the `column_op` function incorrectly tries to access `b.iloc[i]` which leads to a TypeError since `b` is a scalar (single value) in this scenario. This error results in the failing test case where the function is unable to perform the multiplication operation between the DataFrame `df` and the Series `ser`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `column_op` function inside the conditional branch where `right` is a Series but `axis` is not "columns." We need to handle the scalar `b` properly to avoid the TypeError and ensure the correct operation is performed column-wise between the DataFrame and the Series.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this correction, the `dispatch_to_series` function should now be able to handle the multiplication operation correctly between the DataFrame and the Series, passing the failing test case.
