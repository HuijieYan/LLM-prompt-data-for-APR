## Bug Analysis
The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function lies in the column operation defined based on the type of the `right` input. In the provided code, when `right` is a scalar or a DataFrame with the same index as the `left` DataFrame, the column operation should be performed column-by-column. However, due to an oversight, the column operation is incorrectly extracting the data corresponding to each column from `right` which leads to incorrect results in the failing test.

## Bug Explanation
In the failing test scenario, the `right` input is a Series containing timedelta values with a RangeIndex. The `left` DataFrame contains numerical values with a RangeIndex for both columns and index. The buggy function incorrectly tries to perform the operation column-by-column against the Series, resulting in the wrong output.

Specifically, the issue arises when extracting the data for each column - the `right.iloc[:, i]` operation is incorrect when dealing with a Series input, causing the incorrect behavior.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To correct the bug, we need to adjust how the column operation is defined for the case when `right` is a Series. Instead of trying to access columns from the Series input, we should directly use the Series `b` in the operation without extracting columns.

## Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the case where `right` is a Series and perform the column operation as expected, resulting in the correct output for the failing test.
