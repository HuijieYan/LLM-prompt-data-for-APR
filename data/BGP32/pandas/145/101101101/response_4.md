## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function arises from the incorrect handling of the `func` operation when one of the input parameters is a Series with a `timedelta64[ns]` data type. This issue leads to improper handling of the operation and results in failing tests, where the expectation is to multiply a DataFrame with a Series containing 'NaT' values.

Specifically, the buggy function fails to correctly handle the case where `right` is a Series with a `timedelta64[ns]` dtype while operating on a DataFrame, resulting in an incorrect output.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the operation between the DataFrame and the Series with a `timedelta64[ns]` dtype is handled properly. We should modify the `column_op` function to correctly handle this scenario, ensuring that the operation is performed as expected.

## The Corrected Version

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns)}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns)}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis in [None, 1, 'columns']:
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns)}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and len(right) == len(left):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns)}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

The corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function includes modifications to handle the different cases when operating on a DataFrame with a Series input, ensuring proper dispatching and operation between the two data structures. By implementing these changes, the function should now pass the failing test case.
