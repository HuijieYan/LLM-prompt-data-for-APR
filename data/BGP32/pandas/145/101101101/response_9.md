The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function lies in how the `left` and `right` inputs are processed to perform element-wise operations. The issue is that the function is not handling the case where `right` is a Series with `axis='columns'` correctly, causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `dispatch_to_series` function to properly handle the case where `right` is a Series and `axis='columns'`. We should perform element-wise operations row-by-row in this case.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, (ABCSeries, ABCDataFrame)):
        if axis == "columns":
            # Perform element-wise operation row-by-row
            assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        else:
            assert right.index.equals(left.index)

            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this corrected version, the function will handle the case where `right` is a Series with `axis='columns'` correctly, and the failing test should now pass.
