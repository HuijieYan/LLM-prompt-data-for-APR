The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function arises from treating the timedelta values in the pandas Series as scalars rather than arrays in the context of performing element-wise multiplication. This leads to incorrect processing and mismatched types of timedelta values. To fix this bug, we need to handle the timedelta values appropriately as arrays.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        # Convert right to an array before applying element-wise operation
        right_arr = right.to_numpy()
        
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], right_arr) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, we convert the `right` Series into a numpy array `right_arr` before applying the function `func` element-wise in the case where `right` is an ABCSeries. This ensures that the timedelta values are correctly handled as arrays during the operation.

By making this adjustment, the function should now correctly handle the timedelta values when performing element-wise operations and pass the failing test case provided.
