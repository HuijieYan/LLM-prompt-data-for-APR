The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is related to the handling of the timedelta data type when performing operations between a DataFrame and a Series. The bug results in the wrong interpretation of timedelta values, leading to incorrect results.

The issue arises when creating the `column_op` function within the `dispatch_to_series` function. The `column_op` function is used to perform element-wise operations between DataFrame columns and scalar values or Series. However, in the case of timedelta data types, the handling is incorrect, leading to the bug.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that timedelta values are correctly processed in the `column_op` function. We should convert the timedelta Series to an ndarray with appropriate values before performing the element-wise operation.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        right_arr = right.array  # Convert Series to ndarray
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], right_arr) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version ensures that when operating with timedelta Series, the Series is correctly converted to an ndarray before the element-wise operation.

After applying this fix, the `dispatch_to_series` function should now handle timedelta values correctly and pass the failing test provided.
