### Analysis:
The error message indicates a `TypeError` occurring during the operation of multiplying a DataFrame by a Series containing NaT (Not-a-Time) values. The error traces back to the function `dispatch_to_series` in the file `pandas/core/ops/__init__.py`.

### Potential Error:
The error is likely to be happening inside the `dispatch_to_series` function when trying to perform element-wise operations between the DataFrame and the Series containing NaT values.

### Cause of Bug:
The bug occurs because the implementation for handling the operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing NaT values is incomplete within the `dispatch_to_series` function. Specifically, the logic for handling the case where the right operand is a scalar or a DataFrame with matching column indices is missing.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the logic for handling different scenarios of operation between a DataFrame and a Series is properly implemented within the `dispatch_to_series` function. This includes properly handling cases where the right operand is a scalar, a DataFrame with matching indices, or a Series with matching indices.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function includes proper handling for the different scenarios of operations between a DataFrame and a Series, ensuring that the operation with a Series containing NaT values is handled correctly.
