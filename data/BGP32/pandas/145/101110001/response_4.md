### Analysis:
1. The `dispatch_to_series` function in the `pandas/core/ops/__init__.py` file is intended to evaluate a frame operation by dispatching to the Series implementation.
2. The failing test is trying to perform a multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing timedelta values, leading to a `TypeError` due to unsupported operand types.
3. The error occurs during the evaluation of the arithmetic operation where `numpy.ndarray` is being multiplied by `NaTType` (Not a Time) leading to an unsupported operand type error.
4. The bug is likely within the `column_op` function inside the `dispatch_to_series` function, where the implementation fails to handle the multiplication operation involving `NaT` values.
5. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the `column_op` function to handle the case where one of the operands is `NaT`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check for `NaT` values in the column operation function and handle them appropriately.
2. Modify the `column_op` function to handle arithmetic operations with `NaT` values.
3. Ensure that the modified `column_op` function returns the correct result in cases involving `NaT` values.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            if pd.isna(b):
                return {i: b for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            if pd.isna(b):
                return {i: b for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function now includes checks to handle `NaT` values appropriately in the `column_op` function, ensuring that the multiplication operation with `NaT` values does not lead to a `TypeError`.
