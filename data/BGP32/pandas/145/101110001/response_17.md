### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is responsible for evaluating frame operations column-by-column and dispatching to the Series implementation.
2. The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` aims to test the behavior of the disptach_to_series function when performing arithmetic operations involving timedelta64 data within a DataFrame.
3. The error occurs when the multiplication operation is performed between a DataFrame `df` and a Series `ser` containing timedelta64 data, resulting in a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'`.
4. The root cause of the error is the multiplication operation handling between the DataFrame and Series involving NaT (Not a Time) values.
5. The strategy for fixing the bug involves ensuring that the operations are correctly handled when encountering NaT values in the timedelta64 Series.

### Fix:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

The fix involves modifying the `column_op` definition within the `dispatch_to_series` function to correctly handle NaT values in the timedelta64 Series during arithmetic operations with the DataFrame. By accessing the Series elements directly using `b[i]` instead of `b.iloc[i]`, we can handle the operation with NaT values properly.
