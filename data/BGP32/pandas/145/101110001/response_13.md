### Potential Error Locations within the Buggy Function:
1. The condition checks for different types of `right` values but does not handle the case where `right` is `NaT`.
2. When `right` is `NaT`, the function attempts to apply the operator to numpy arrays and NaTType, leading to a TypeError.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function `dispatch_to_series` does not have a specific case to handle `right` values that are `NaT`. When trying to apply the operator to a numpy array and `NaTType`, a TypeError is raised since the operation between these types is not supported.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to introduce a specific handling case in the `dispatch_to_series` function to handle the scenario when `right` is `NaT`. Therefore, we need to adjust the logic within the function to properly handle this case and prevent the TypeError from occurring.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif right == pd.NaT:  # New handling for NaT value
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], pd.to_timedelta(b, errors='coerce')) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

### Outcome:
By incorporating a specific handling case for `NaT` values within the `dispatch_to_series` function, the corrected version of the function should now properly handle the scenario where `right` is `NaT`, preventing the TypeError from occurring.
