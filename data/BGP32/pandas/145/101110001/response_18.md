### Analysis:
The given buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is used to evaluate frame operations by performing column-wise operations. The function contains subfunctions `column_op` for different data types like DataFrame, Series, and scalar. The error message indicates that there is an issue with performing the multiplication operation (`*`) between a DataFrame and a Series containing `NaT` (Not a Time) values.

### Error Location:
The error occurs when the `df * ser` operation is performed in the failing test. The code enters the `dispatch_to_series` function, where the logic for handling different data types is implemented. The issue arises when the code reaches the case for handling a Series in `elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries)` where it does not correctly handle the `NaT` values.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the code does not handle the `NaT` values in the Series object correctly when performing the multiplication operation. This leads to the failure of the operation and results in a `TypeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `dispatch_to_series` function to handle `NaT` values when operating on Series objects column-wise. Specifically, we need to address the case where a Series object is involved in the operation and contains `NaT` values.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function that handles `NaT` values properly:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns)}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns) or right.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]'

        def column_op(a, b):
            if right.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]' and isinstance(b, pd.Timedelta):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            else:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, we added a specific check for `timedelta64[ns]` type compatibility when handling Series objects. The code now handles the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing `NaT` values correctly.

Please try this corrected version in your codebase and check if it resolves the issue with the failing test case.
