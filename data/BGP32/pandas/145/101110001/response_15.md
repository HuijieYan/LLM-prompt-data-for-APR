### Analysis:
The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is designed to handle various cases when performing operations between a DataFrame and a scalar, DataFrame, or Series. The specific error in this case is related to the interaction between the DataFrame `df` and the Series `ser` when attempting to perform the multiplication operation. The error message indicates that the operation is trying to multiply a numpy array with `NaTType` which is not supported.

### Error location:
The issue lies in the implementation of the `column_op` function inside the `dispatch_to_series` function. There is a conditional statement for handling cases when `right` is an instance of `ABCSeries` but it does not correctly account for the situation where `right` is a scalar with `NaT` values.

### Bug Cause:
The error is occurring because the `column_op` function is trying to apply the operation `func` between the DataFrame columns and the scalar value that is `NaT` which leads to the `TypeError` as it cannot perform the operation between a numpy array and `NaTType`.

### Strategy to fix the bug:
1. Update the `column_op` function to correctly handle the case when the `right` parameter is a scalar with `NaT` values.
2. Modify the `column_op` function to determine the correct operation based on the type of the `right` parameter.
3. Ensure that the correct operation between the DataFrame columns and the scalar `NaT` is implemented to avoid the `TypeError`.

### Corrected implementation of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    # with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)

    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            # Handle the case when `right` is a scalar with `NaT` values
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isna(b) else np.nan for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this corrected implementation, the `dispatch_to_series` function should now handle the case when the `right` parameter is a scalar with `NaT` values, preventing the `TypeError` encountered in the failing test case.
