### Analysis:
The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` is performing a multiplication operation between a DataFrame `df` and a Series `ser` containing two NaT (Not-a-Time) values. The operation triggers the `dispatch_to_series` function within the `pandas.core.ops` module, which in turn calls the `expressions.evaluate` function to evaluate the multiplication operation. However, the current implementation of the `dispatch_to_series` function is not handling the case of a numpy array multiplied by a NaTType properly, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to perform the operation.

### Bugs in the Buggy Function:
1. The `na_arithmetic_op` function fails when attempting the operation, giving a `TypeError`.
2. The implementation of `dispatch_to_series` does not properly handle the case of a numpy array being multiplied by a NaTType, which is causing the error.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `dispatch_to_series` function not properly handling the case where a numpy array is multiplied by a NaTType (NaT). This leads to an unsupported operand type error and triggers the TypeError during the evaluation of the operation.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the implementation of the `dispatch_to_series` function to handle the case of a numpy array multiplied by a NaTType gracefully.

### Corrected Version of the `dispatch_to_series` Function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right, use_numexpr=False)
    return new_data
```

By setting `use_numexpr=False` when calling `expressions.evaluate`, we ensure that the operation is evaluated without attempting to use numexpr, which can lead to compatibility issues with certain data types like NaTType during arithmetic operations.

### Testing the Corrected Version:
After making the above change, the `dispatch_to_series` function should now handle the multiplication operation between the DataFrame and the Series containing NaT values correctly, resolving the TypeError encountered in the failing test.
