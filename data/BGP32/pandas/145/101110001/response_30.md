### Analysis:
The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` in the `pandas.core.ops.__init__` file is encountering an error when trying to perform arithmetic operations between a DataFrame and a Series containing "NaT" values.

The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` in the `pandas/tests/frame/test_arithmetic.py` file is trying to perform multiplication operation (`*`) between a DataFrame and a Series containing "NaT" values. The purpose of the test is to ensure that timedelta64(NaT) values are not treated as datetime64 values.

The error message indicates that the issue occurs when trying to perform the multiplication operation between a numpy array and a 'NaTType' (Not-a-Time) value, resulting in a `TypeError`.

### Bugs and Causes:
The bug arises from the implementation of the `column_op` function inside the `dispatch_to_series` function. Specifically, the case where the right operand is of type `NaTType` is not handled correctly, causing the TypeError during the arithmetic operation.

The `column_op` function is incorrectly implemented to handle various scenarios of operands, but it fails to account for the case when the right operand is of type `NaTType`, leading to the `TypeError`.

### Strategy for Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to update the `column_op` function within the `dispatch_to_series` function to correctly handle the case when the right operand is a 'NaTType'. This can be achieved by adding a condition to skip operations on 'NaTType' values.

We need to modify the implementation of the `column_op` function to check for 'NaTType' values and avoid performing arithmetic operations with them.

### Bug-fix in the `dispatch_to_series` function:
Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function with an updated `column_op` implementation that skips operations on 'NaTType' values:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    # with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            if libops.isscalar(b) and lib.is_na(b):
                return {i: b for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By adding a check for 'NaTType' values in the `column_op` function within the `dispatch_to_series` function, we ensure that operations involving 'NaTType' values will not be performed, preventing the `TypeError` encountered in the failing test.
