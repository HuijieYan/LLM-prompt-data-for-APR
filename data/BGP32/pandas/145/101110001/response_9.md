### Analysis:
- The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is used to evaluate a frame operation by applying a function `func` column-by-column specifically for DataFrame objects. It handles different cases based on the type of `right` input.
- The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` involves performing arithmetic operation (`*`) between a DataFrame and a Series with `"timedelta64[ns]"` dtype where the Series contains `NaT` values. The expected behavior is to perform element-wise multiplication and maintain `NaT` values in the resulting DataFrame.
- The error occurs due to the presence of `NaT` values in the Series, causing a `TypeError` when trying to perform the multiplication operation between `NaTType` and a numpy array.

### Bug Location:
- The bug is likely located in the `column_op` definition within the `dispatch_to_series` function. Specifically, in cases where `right` is an instance of `ABCSeries`, `NaT` values in the Series are causing issues during the operation.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the improper handling of `NaT` values in the Series where the operation is attempting to multiply a numpy array with `NaTType`, leading to a `TypeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, the `column_op` function should handle cases involving `NaT` values to allow element-wise computation with the numpy arrays in a way that maintains the `NaT` values in the result.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns)}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns)}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and np.any(pd.isna(b)):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: np.where(pd.isna(b), b, func(a.iloc[:, i], b)) for i in range(len(a.columns)}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
``` 

This corrected version of the function now properly handles the case when the `right` input is an instance of ABCSeries with `NaT` values by using `np.where` to maintain the `NaT` values during element-wise computation.
