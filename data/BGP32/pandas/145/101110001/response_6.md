### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is responsible for evaluating frame operations column-by-column by dispatching to the Series implementation.
2. The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` checks if the function correctly handles a DataFrame multiplied by a Series of `timedelta64[ns]` type.
3. The error occurs when trying to evaluate the multiplication operation between a NumPy array and `NaT` type (`timedelta64[ns]` equivalent to `NaTType`).
4. The error message shows that the issue arises from the `masked_arith_op` function in `array_ops.py`.
5. The bug is related to handling the `NaT` type in the arithmetic operation, which results in a `TypeError`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by trying to perform an unsupported arithmetic operation between a NumPy array and `NaT` type in the `masked_arith_op` function, specifically during the multiplication operation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the arithmetic operation involves an `NaT` type. We should replace these operations with a special case handling to make the operation compatible and prevent the `TypeError`.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if b != pd.NaT else b for i in range(len(a.columns))}  # Fix for NaT type

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version of the function includes a special case handling for the `NaT` type in the column operation when dealing with Series. The correction prevents the `TypeError` by checking if the right operand is `NaT` before performing the arithmetic operation.
