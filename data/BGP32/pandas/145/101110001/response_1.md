### Analysis:
1. The failing test involves performing arithmetic operation between a DataFrame and a Series where the Series contains timedelta values including "NaT" (Not a Time).
2. The error occurs during the evaluation of the operation in the `dispatch_to_series` function, specifically inside the `expressions.evaluate` call.
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'`, meaning that the operation between a numpy array and "NaT" type is not supported.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the handling of the "NaT" values in the Series when performing element-wise multiplication with the DataFrame. The function is not properly dealing with the "NaT" type during the arithmetic operation, leading to the TypeError.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `column_op` function in the `dispatch_to_series` function to handle the "NaT" values correctly. We should check for "NaT" values explicitly and handle them gracefully during the arithmetic operation.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns) if not pd.api_types.is_list_like(b) else b.size)}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns) if not pd.api_types.is_list_like(b.iloc[:, i]) else b.iloc[:, i].size)}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if not pd.isna(b.iloc[i]) else np.nan for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isna(b) else np.nan for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

After making these changes, the corrected function should handle the "NaT" values appropriately during the arithmetic operation between the DataFrame and Series, resolving the issue described in the failing test case.
