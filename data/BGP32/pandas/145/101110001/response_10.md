### Analysis:
- The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is used to evaluate frame operations by dispatching to the Series implementation column by column.
- The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` is trying to perform an operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing `NaT` values of type `timedelta64[ns]`.
- The error occurs when trying to multiply an array with `NaT`, which leads to a `TypeError`.

### Bug Location:
The bug is likely in the `column_op` function within the `dispatch_to_series` function, specifically when trying to perform operations between arrays that include `NaT` values.

### Bug Cause:
The `NaT` values are causing the `TypeError` because the operation is not supported between a numpy array and `NaT`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when performing operations involving `NaT` values correctly. We should ignore the `NaT` values or handle them separately when executing operations involving them.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns)) if not pd.isnull(b)}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns)) if not b.iloc[:, i].isnull().any()}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns)) if not pd.isnull(b.iloc[i])}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns)) if not pd.isnull(b.iloc[i])}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

### Correction Rationale:
- In the corrected version, we added conditions to check for `NaT` or `NaN` values in the `b` array when performing operations between arrays.
- By excluding the `NaT` or `NaN` values from the operations, we prevent the `TypeError` that occurred due to the unsupported operation with `NaT`.

### With this correction, the provided failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` should pass successfully.
