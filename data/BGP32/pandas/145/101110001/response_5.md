### Analysis:
1. The `dispatch_to_series` function is designed to evaluate a frame operation by handling different types of inputs such as scalars, DataFrames, and Series. It dispatches the operation to the appropriate implementation based on the type of inputs.
2. The failing test involves multiplying a DataFrame `df` with a Series `ser` containing timedelta64 values.
3. The error message indicates a `TypeError` in the `_evaluate_standard` function, stating that it encountered an unsupported operand type for multiplication between 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'.
4. The cause of the bug lies within the `column_op` function inside `dispatch_to_series` where it incorrectly handles the case of operating on a DataFrame and a timedelta Series, leading to the unsupported operation error.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Identify the case where the error occurs, which is when trying to perform an operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing timedelta64 values.
2. Update the `column_op` function to correctly handle this case by checking the type of the right operand and allowing for the arithmetic operation involving timedelta data.
3. Use the `Timedelta` objects from `pandas._libs` for timedelta operations for compatibility.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns)}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        if isinstance(right.array, ABCTimedeltaArray):
            # Handle timedelta series
            right = right.array.view(Timedelta)
        
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By updating the `column_op` function to handle the timedelta Series case correctly, the corrected version should fix the bug and pass the failing test.
