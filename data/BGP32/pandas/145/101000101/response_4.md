The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` has an issue in creating the `column_op` function to handle different cases based on the type of the `right` parameter. The bug is causing incorrect handling of the operations within the `column_op` function, leading to unexpected results.

The main cause of the bug is the incorrect assignment of the `right` parameter inside the `column_op` nested functions. The bug is likely to lead to improper handling of scalar or DataFrame inputs, resulting in unexpected outcomes.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `right` parameter is properly passed and assigned inside each `column_op` function based on the specific case. We should also make sure that the operations are performed correctly column-by-column within each case based on the input types.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)
    
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle different types of `right` inputs and perform the operations column-by-column based on the specific case. This should address the bug and ensure that the function returns the expected results for various scenarios.
