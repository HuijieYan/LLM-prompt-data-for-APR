### Analysis
The `dispatch_to_series` function is designed to evaluate frame operation by dispatching to the Series implementation. It handles different cases based on the type of `right` input parameter (scalar, DataFrame, Series) and the `axis` parameter.

In the expected case 1, the `right` parameter is a Series with `dtype` timedelta64[ns] and the `func` parameter is a multiplication function. The function should iterate over columns in the DataFrame `left`, perform the operation with the corresponding values from the Series `right`, and return a dictionary with the results.

The bug seems to be in how `column_op` is defined within the if-elif-else block logic. It should be defined outside these conditions to be a standalone function.

### Bug
The bug in this code arises from the definition of `column_op` inside the if-elif-else block conditional statements. Each time it goes through a condition block, it redefines `column_op` based on the condition, which causes unintended behavior. The correct approach is to define `column_op` outside of these conditions so that it is consistently used in the final `expressions.evaluate` call.

### Fix
1. Move the definition of `column_op` outside of the if-elif-else block to ensure consistency.
2. Update the return statements within each if-elif-else block to correctly utilize the `column_op` function.

### Corrected Version
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    def column_op(a, b):
        return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns)}

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    return new_data
``` 

With this correction, the `column_op` function is properly defined outside the conditional blocks and consistently utilized to handle the different cases based on the type of `right` input parameter.
