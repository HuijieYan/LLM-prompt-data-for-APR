## Bug Explanation
In the buggy function `dispatch_to_series`, the main issue occurs within the `column_op` nested functions. The nested functions are defined conditionally based on the type of the `right` parameter. However, the operations within these nested functions use the same logic, where they iterate over the columns of the input DataFrame `a` and apply the function `func` to the corresponding elements with `b`. This logic is inconsistent with the different cases handled based on the type of `right`. Specifically, the cases that check for `ABCDataFrame` and `ABCSeries` types should handle the columns differently, but they currently do not.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic within the nested `column_op` functions to properly handle the different cases specified in the conditional blocks. We should differentiate the handling of `ABCDataFrame` and `ABCSeries` types to ensure that the correct operations are applied column-wise. Additionally, we need to align the output of the nested functions with the expected data structure.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By aligning the logic within the nested functions to differentiate between handling `ABCDataFrame` and `ABCSeries` types, the corrected function ensures that the column-wise operations are applied correctly based on the input parameter types. This updated version should now satisfy the expected input/output values for the provided test cases.
