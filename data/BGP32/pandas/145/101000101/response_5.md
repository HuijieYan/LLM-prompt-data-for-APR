The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is supposed to evaluate frame operations by dispatching to the Series implementation column-by-column based on the input parameters provided. However, the bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of the input parameters and the creation of the `column_op` function within the function.

Upon analysis, here are the potential issues contributing to the bug:
1. The `column_op` function is defined multiple times but not used within the `dispatch_to_series` function correctly.
2. The conditional branching in the function based on the type of `right` is not being utilized effectively to determine the correct column operation.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the way the `column_op` function is defined and used based on the type of `right` provided in the input. We can simplify the conditional handling to ensure that the correct column operation is applied to the DataFrame columns.

Here is a corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compatibility with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a):
            return func(a, right)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version:
- The `column_op` function is simplified based on the type of the `right` parameter and how it should be applied to the DataFrame columns.
- The conditional branching is adjusted to ensure the correct `column_op` function is defined and used for evaluation.
- The input parameters are appropriately utilized within the defined `column_op` functions.

This corrected version should now handle the input parameters correctly and provide the expected output based on the defined cases.
