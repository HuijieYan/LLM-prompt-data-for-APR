### Analysis
The `dispatch_to_series` function is designed to evaluate frame operations by dispatching to the Series implementation column-by-column. The function defines `column_op` functions based on the type of the `right` parameter. The bug seems to be related to handling different types of `right` inputs and performing the column-wise operation accordingly.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because when `right` input is a Series and `axis` is not specified as `'columns'`, the function attempts to match the index of the Series with the index of the DataFrame (`left`), but it actually needs to match with the columns of the DataFrame. This causes a mismatch in the dimensions of input arrays leading to incorrect results.

### Fix Strategy
- Address the specific case where `right` is an ABCSeries and perform the operation column-wise by matching with the columns of the DataFrame instead of the index.
- Handle the case where `axis` is not `'columns'` appropriately.

###  Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):

        def column_op(a, b):
            if axis == "columns":
                assert b.index.equals(a.columns)
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i].values, b.values) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            else:
                assert b.index.equals(a.index)
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i].values, b.values[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By making these adjustments to handle the case where `right` is a Series and the appropriate column-wise operation is performed based on the `axis` parameter, the corrected function should now process the input correctly and return the expected output for all test cases.
