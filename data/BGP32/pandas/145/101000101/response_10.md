The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function lies within the `column_op` functions that are defined based on the input parameters `left` and `right`. The structure of the conditional statements is correct, but the implementation of the `column_op` functions is not handling the input correctly, leading to incorrect output.

The bug occurs because the `column_op` functions are not correctly unpacking the DataFrame columns for computation. In the case where `right` is a Series and the axis is `"columns"`, the implementation should operate row-by-row, but the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `column_op` functions so that they correctly handle the computation based on the input parameters. Specifically, the `column_op` function for the case where `right` is a Series and the axis is `"columns"` should iterate over the rows of both `a` and `b` to perform the computation.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # Operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version should now correctly handle the case where `right` is a Series and the axis is set to `"columns"` by iterating over the rows for computation. It ensures all expected values and types are satisfied.
