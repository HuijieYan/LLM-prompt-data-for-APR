The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is designed to evaluate frame operations by dispatching column-by-column to the Series implementation. The function takes in parameters `left` (a DataFrame), `right` (a scalar or DataFrame), `func` (an arithmetic or comparison operator), `str_rep` (a string representing the operation), and `axis` (the axis to operate on).

The bug occurs in the handling of the input `right` parameter, where the function incorrectly assumes that the input can be converted to a scalar or DataFrame, leading to a computation error.

To fix this bug:
1. Update the code to correctly handle the different types of input for `right`, such as scalar, scalar-like, or DataFrame-like inputs.
2. Ensure that the shape and dimensions of the DataFrame inputs are aligned for the operation.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    
    def operate_on_column(a, b, func):
        return func(a, b)
    
    if isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and right.index.equals(left.columns):
        # column-wise operation
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col: operate_on_column(col, right, func))
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and right.index.equals(left.index):
        # row-wise operation
        new_data = left.apply(lambda row: operate_on_column(row, right, func), axis=1)
    else:
        # scalar operation
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))
    
    return new_data
```

This corrected version of the function handles the different types of input for `right` correctly and performs the operation based on the type of input provided. The function applies the operation either column-wise, row-wise, or as a scalar operation based on the conditions specified in the function.
