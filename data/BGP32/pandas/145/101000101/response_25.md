The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is designed to apply a function (`func`) between a DataFrame (`left`) and either a scalar or another DataFrame (`right`) column-wise. The function uses different strategies based on the type of `right`, such as a scalar, DataFrame, or Series. However, there is a bug related to handling the case where `right` is a Series and `axis` is specified as `'columns'`.

The bug arises when `right` is a Series, `axis` is `'columns'`, and you call `right.index.equals(left.columns)`. In this case, columns of `left` will be matched with the index of `right`.

To fix this bug, the function should correctly broadcast the operation column-by-column, considering the index alignment between `left` and `right` based on the specified axis.

In the corrected version below, we adjust the column operation to handle the case where `right` is a Series and `axis` is `'columns'`. We iterate over the column indices of `left` and apply the function to each column along with the corresponding row values from the Series `right`.

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        column_op = lambda a, b: {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        column_op = lambda a, b: {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        column_op = lambda a, b: {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        column_op = lambda a, b: {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this corrected version, the function now correctly handles the case where `right` is a Series, `axis` is `'columns'`, and the columns of `left` should be matched against the index of `right`.
