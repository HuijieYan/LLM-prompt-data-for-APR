The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be related to the handling of the `right` parameter when it is a Series. The function is supposed to handle different cases based on the type of `right` and the value of `axis`, but there seems to be a mistake in the implementation.

In the provided buggy function, when `right` is a Series and `axis` is not "columns", the function mistakenly tries to access elements from `right` as if it were a DataFrame, leading to an error. This discrepancy in handling the `right` parameter based on the value of `axis` causes the bug.

To fix this bug, we can modify the implementation of the function to correctly handle the case where `right` is a Series and `axis` is not "columns". Specifically, when `right` is a Series, we should consider the shape of the Series and handle the operation accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        if axis == "columns" or right.index.equals(left.columns):
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        else:
            def column_op(a, b):
                return func(a, b)
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)
    
    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version handles the case when `right` is a Series and `axis` is not "columns" by directly applying the operation between `left` and `right` instead of trying to access elements as if `right` were a DataFrame.

Please test this corrected version with the provided expected values and types of variables to ensure that it satisfies the requirements. Let me know if you need further assistance.
