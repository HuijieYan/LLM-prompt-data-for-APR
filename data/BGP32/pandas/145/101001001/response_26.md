The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is that the `right` variable is always considered as a scalar or a DataFrame, leading to incorrect handling of cases when `right` is a Series. This results in a ValueError due to the code not being able to handle the given input properly.

To fix this bug, we need to update the conditional statements in the function to properly handle the case when `right` is a Series. We should check for `ABCExtensionArray` type to cover Series objects.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, (ABCDataFrame, ABCSeries, ABCExtensionArray)):
        assert right._indexed_same(left) or right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle DataFrame and Series cases

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By making these changes, the function will now properly handle cases where `right` is a Series. This should resolve the bug and prevent the ValueError from occurring.
