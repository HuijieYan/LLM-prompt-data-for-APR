The issue in the buggy function `dispatch_to_series` lies in the logic of the `column_op` function being overwritten multiple times based on conditions. This leads to incorrect behavior when applying the function to different types of inputs.

To fix the bug and ensure consistent behavior, we can refactor the function to have a single `column_op` implementation that handles all cases appropriately. This implementation should address the different scenarios based on the type of the `right` input (scalar, DataFrame, Series) and the `axis` value.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In this corrected version, we have consolidated the `column_op` logic into a single implementation that properly handles different input scenarios based on the type of `right` and the `axis` value. This should ensure that the function behaves consistently and processes the inputs correctly.
