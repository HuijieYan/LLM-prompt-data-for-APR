The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function lies in how the `column_op` function is defined based on the input parameters `left`, `right`, and `axis`. The error arises when trying to perform element-wise operations between a DataFrame and a Series in the case where `right` is a Series and `axis` is not specified as `'columns'`.

### Bug Explanation:
In the buggy implementation, when `right` is a Series and `axis` is not specified as `'columns'`, the `column_op` function is incorrectly defined to operate column-wise instead of row-wise. This results in a mismatch in dimensions, causing the `NotImplementedError`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, the `column_op` function should be defined to operate row-wise when `right` is a Series and `axis` is not equal to `'columns'`.

### Updated Corrected Version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[i], b) for i in range(len(a))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

Now, the corrected `column_op` function operates row-wise when dealing with a Series and not specifically in the `'columns'` axis case. This should resolve the bug and handle the element-wise operations correctly in all cases.
