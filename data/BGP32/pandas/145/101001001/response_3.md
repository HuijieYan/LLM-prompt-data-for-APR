The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be related to how the `column_op` function is defined and used within different branches of the `if` statements. The `column_op` function is redefined multiple times based on different conditions, but the final definition should cover all possible scenarios to avoid errors.

The issue arises when the input `right` is a Series and the `axis` is set to `"columns"`. In this case, the function tries to access `b.iloc[i]`, which is causing the error because `right` is a Series and does not have the same structure as `a.iloc[:, i]`.

To fix this bug, we need to define the `column_op` function in a way that handles all possible scenarios for the input `right`. We can accomplish this by checking the type of `right` and adjusting the column operation accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function with a modified `column_op` function that covers all scenarios:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        if axis == "columns":
            assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        else:
            assert right.index.equals(left.index)

            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In this corrected version, the `column_op` function is defined based on the type of `right` and the value of `axis`, ensuring that the appropriate operation is performed for each scenario.

This fix should address the error where the function was trying to access incorrect elements of `right` when `right` is a Series and `axis` is set to `"columns"`.
