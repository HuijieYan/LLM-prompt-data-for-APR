The bug in the provided function `dispatch_to_series` lies in the column_op function definitions inside different conditions. These functions are supposed to execute the arithmetic or comparison operation between DataFrame columns and either a scalar or another DataFrame/Series. However, the implementation in each condition does not match the expected behavior, as they all perform the operation between a DataFrame column and a single value element-wise.

### Bug Explanation
In the case where `right` is a Series and `axis` is set to "columns", the function should operate row-by-row between DataFrame columns and corresponding Series values. However, the current implementation in that condition does element-wise operation instead of row-wise operation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to update the column_op function definition inside the condition where `right` is a Series and `axis` is set to "columns" to correctly perform row-wise operation between DataFrame columns and Series values.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By updating the column_op function inside the specified condition to perform row-wise operation between DataFrame columns and Series values, the bug should be fixed for the described scenario.
