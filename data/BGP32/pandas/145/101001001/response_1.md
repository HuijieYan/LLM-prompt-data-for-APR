The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function arises from the way the `column_op` function is defined based on the type of the `right` input. In the given scenario, the `right` input is a Series with the index as a `RangeIndex`, but the function handles it incorrectly. 

The issue occurs in the block of code where `right` is a Series and `axis` is "columns". In this case, the function should operate row-by-row, but the current implementation tries to access the elements of `b` using `iloc[i]`, which is incorrect as `b` is a Series and not a DataFrame.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `column_op` function for the case where `right` is a Series with `axis` as "columns". We should access the elements using the index directly rather than using `iloc`.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.loc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By modifying the `column_op` function to correctly access the elements of `b` using `b.loc[i]`, we ensure that the function operates row-by-row when `right` is a Series and `axis` is set to "columns". This correction should address the bug and allow the function to work correctly in the given scenario.
