The issue in the provided buggy function is that the `func` operation is being applied to the entire DataFrame by iterating over columns using `iloc`. The intent seems to be to apply the operation element-wise, but the implementation does not handle it correctly in all cases.

The problematic block in the function is where `column_op` is defined based on different conditions. In all cases, the implementation applies the function to each column of the DataFrame, which is incorrect because it should be applied element-wise when operating on a Series.

Here are the suggested steps to fix the bug:
1. Modify the `column_op` functions to apply the `func` element-wise to each element pair instead of column-wise.
2. Update the conditions to check for the type of `right` and return a modified `column_op` accordingly.
3. Use the `apply` method on the DataFrame to apply the operation element-wise.

Below is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    element-wise, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)

    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        
        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)
        
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)
        
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = left.apply(lambda x: column_op(x, right))
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, the `func` operation is applied element-wise to each element pair by using the `apply` method on the DataFrame. This change ensures that the operation is carried out correctly for all cases provided.
