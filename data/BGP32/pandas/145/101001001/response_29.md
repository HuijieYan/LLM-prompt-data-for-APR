The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function lies in the construction of the `column_op` function that performs the operation based on the type of `right` input. In the `elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries)` block where `right` is a series and `axis` is not set to "columns", the operation is not correctly applied to each column of the DataFrame `a`.

The cause of the bug is that the `b` index is being improperly accessed in the `column_op` function when `right` is an ABCSeries and `axis` is not "columns". This leads to a mismatch in the dimensions of `b` and `right` which causes errors in the operation.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the way `b` is accessed when `right` is an ABCSeries. We should modify the `column_op` function in the elif block for ABCSeries to correctly apply the operation row by row.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, when `right` is an ABCSeries and `axis` is not set to "columns", the `column_op` function now correctly applies the operation row by row by accessing `b` based on the index `i`.
