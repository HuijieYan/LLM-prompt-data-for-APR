The bug in the provided function `dispatch_to_series` lies in the implementation of the `column_op` functions for different types of inputs. The issue is that for the case where `right` is a Series and `axis` is set to `'columns'`, the function doesn't handle the column operations correctly.

In the given runtime values for Case 1, when `right` is a Series with `axis='columns'`, the function should perform row-by-row operations. However, the existing implementation incorrectly attempts to apply column-wise operations.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the implementation of the `column_op` function for the case when `right` is a Series and `axis` is set to `'columns'`. We should iterate over the rows (`b.iloc`) of the Series `b` and perform operations with each row of the DataFrame `a`.

Here is the corrected version of the function `dispatch_to_series`:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    
    def column_op(a, b):
        return {i: func(a.iloc[i], b) for i in range(len(a))}

    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        
        return pd.DataFrame({col: column_op(left[col], right) for col in left.columns})

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))} 
    
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)
    
    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In this correction, the case for a Series `right` with `axis='columns'` is handled separately, ensuring row-wise operations are performed, solving the bug where incorrect column-wise operations were attempted.
