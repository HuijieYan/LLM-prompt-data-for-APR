### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function arises from the implementation of the `column_op` function within it. The `column_op` function is defined multiple times based on different conditions, but each redefinition overwrites the previous one. As a result, when the `column_op` function is actually called inside `dispatch_to_series`, it uses the last definition encountered. This leads to incorrect behavior based on the conditions checked.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `column_op` function is defined only once, based on the appropriate condition. A strategy to fix the bug would involve correctly defining the `column_op` function based on the type of `right` and the value of `axis`. Ensuring that only one definition of `column_op` is present will prevent the incorrect behavior caused by overwriting.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op(left, right), str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In this corrected version, the `column_op` function is defined based on the relevant condition only once, ensuring that the correct operation is performed based on the input parameters.
