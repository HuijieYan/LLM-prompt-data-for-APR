## Bug Fix

### 1. Analysis:
The `dispatch_to_series` function is designed to evaluate frame operations by column while dispatching to the Series implementation. The bug seems to be related to handling scalar or DataFrame types and correctly performing the operation column-wise. In the failing test case, we are testing multiplication (`*`) of a DataFrame and a Series containing timedelta values to ensure correct handling of NaT values.

### 2. Bug Location:
The bug is likely located in the section where different cases based on the type of `right` are handled, specifically in the logic for constructing the `column_op` function.

### 3. Bug Explanation:
- In the failing test case, when `right` is a Series of `timedelta64[ns]` type, the expected behavior is to operate column-wise on the DataFrame `left`.
- However, the current implementation does not handle this case correctly, resulting in the wrong behavior.
- When the multiplication operation `func` is applied to the DataFrame columns and the Series, the resulting DataFrame has the values of the Series replicated for each column, which is incorrect.

### 4. Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the construction of the `column_op` function based on the type of `right` when it is a Series of `timedelta64[ns]`. We should ensure that the operation is performed correctly column-wise.

### 5. Corrected Version:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and issubclass(right.dtype.type, np.timedelta64):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: a.iloc[:, i].apply(lambda x: func(x, b.iloc[i])) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)
    
    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this corrected version, we specifically handle the case when `right` is a Series of `timedelta64[ns]` type by adjusting the `column_op` function to apply the operation correctly on each column of the DataFrame. This modification should address the bug and make the function behave as expected in the failing test case.
