The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be related to how the operation between a DataFrame and a Series of timedelta values is handled. The bug arises when handling the case where the right input is a Series containing timedelta values, and the operation is to multiply each element of the DataFrame by the corresponding element of the Series.

The bug arises in the creation of the `column_op` function inside `dispatch_to_series`. The function should handle the case where the right input is a Series, and the operation should be applied element-wise between the DataFrame columns and the Series values. However, the current implementation incorrectly treats the Series values as scalars instead of arrays of values for each column.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `column_op` function to properly handle the case where the right input is a Series. Each column in the DataFrame should be multiplied by the corresponding value in the Series. We can achieve this by converting the Series values into an array and then performing element-wise multiplication with each column.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.values) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This fix should properly handle the element-wise multiplication operation between the DataFrame and the Series of timedelta values, ensuring that the expected output is produced for the failing test case provided.
