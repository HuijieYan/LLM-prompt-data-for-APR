## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function lies in the incorrect handling of the `right` input parameter when it is a Series of type `timedelta64[ns]`. The function wrongly assumes that converting the Series to a numpy array will maintain the `timedelta64[ns]` type, while it actually converts it to an array of strings, leading to incorrect behavior during the operation.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the Series of type `timedelta64[ns]` remains as such when converting to an array. This can be achieved by using the `values` attribute of the Series to get the underlying numpy array that maintains the correct type.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.values) for i in range(len(a.columns))}  # Use .values to maintain the correct type

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

After applying this correction, the `dispatch_to_series` function should now properly handle the Series of type `timedelta64[ns]` and give the expected output for the failing test case provided.
