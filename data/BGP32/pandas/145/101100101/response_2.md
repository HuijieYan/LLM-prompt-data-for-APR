## Analysis
The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is designed to evaluate arithmetic operations between a DataFrame and another DataFrame or scalar value column by column, dispatching to the Series implementation. The issue seems to be with how the `right` parameter is processed, specifically converting it to a scalar value in some cases. This conversion causes the subsequent operations to fail, as the expected type is not preserved.

## Bug
The bug lies in the handling of the `right` parameter in the `dispatch_to_series` function. When `right` is detected as a scalar or a zero-dimensional ndarray, the function creates a `column_op` function that performs the operation between the DataFrame and the scalar value. However, the conversion of `right` to a scalar value using `lib.item_from_zerodim(right)` leads to the loss of the original type information, causing subsequent operations to fail with unexpected types.

## Fix
To fix this bug, we need to update the logic in the `dispatch_to_series` function to preserve the type of the `right` parameter correctly. We can achieve this by storing the non-scalars as they are and performing the operation accordingly in the `column_op` function.

## Corrected Version
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function should preserve the type of the `right` parameter correctly, ensuring that the operations are performed as expected and passing the failing test case.
