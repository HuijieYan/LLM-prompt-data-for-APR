## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function lies in the way it handles the case when `right` is a scalar or a Series object with a specified axis. When `right` is a Series with `axis="columns"`, the function incorrectly generates the result by treating the values in the Series as individual rows instead of columns. This leads to an incorrect operation when performing arithmetic operations like multiplication between a DataFrame and a Series with `axis="columns"`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic inside the `dispatch_to_series` function to correctly handle the case when `right` is a Series with `axis="columns"`. Specifically, we need to iterate over the columns in the DataFrame and apply the operation between each column and the corresponding values in the Series.

## The Corrected Version of the Function

```python
# Fixed version with the bug corrected

def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate column-by-column
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            col_values = {col: b[col] for col in b.index}
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], col_values[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By iterating over the columns in the `right` Series when `axis="columns"`, the corrected version of the function ensures that the arithmetic operation is applied correctly between the DataFrame and the Series, producing the expected output for cases like the failing test provided.
