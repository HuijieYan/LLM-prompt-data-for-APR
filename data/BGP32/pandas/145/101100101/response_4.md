## Analysis
The `dispatch_to_series` function is designed to evaluate an operation between a DataFrame and either a scalar, another DataFrame, or a Series. The function determines the appropriate operation based on the type of the right operand and the specified axis.

In the failing test case, the operation involves multiplying a DataFrame (`df`) by a Series (`ser`) of dtype `timedelta64[ns]`. The expected output (`expected`) is a DataFrame where each column is the product of the corresponding column in `df` and the Series `ser`.

The bug occurs in the `dispatch_to_series` function when handling the case where the right operand is a Series and the axis is set to "columns". The implementation provided in the function does not correctly handle this scenario, leading to the incorrect result in the failing test.

## Bug Explanation
The bug arises from the incorrect implementation of the `column_op` function within the `dispatch_to_series` function when the right operand is a Series and the axis is set to "columns". In this case, the function should multiply each column of the DataFrame `left` by the corresponding value of the Series `right`. However, the current implementation incorrectly processes the indices.

The bug causes the operation to apply multiplication row-by-row instead of column-by-column, leading to unexpected results in the failing test.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the implementation of the `column_op` function within the `dispatch_to_series` function when dealing with a Series operand and the axis set to "columns". We should iterate over the columns of the DataFrame and apply the operation to each column with the corresponding value from the Series. This adjustment ensures that the multiplication operation is correctly applied column-wise.

Let's proceed with providing a corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function.

## Corrected Version
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # Corrected implementation for column-wise operation
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By correcting the implementation of the `column_op` function for the specific case of a Series operand with the axis set to "columns", we ensure that the operation is correctly applied column-wise. This corrected version should now pass the failing test case and provide the expected output.
