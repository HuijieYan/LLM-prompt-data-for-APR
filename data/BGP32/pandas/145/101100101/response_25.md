## Bug Explanation

The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function lies in the `column_op` function definitions based on the type of the `right` parameter. In the provided code, all the `column_op` function definitions essentially perform the same operation internally by iterating over the columns of the input DataFrame `a`. This causes the function to always treat `right` as if it were a scalar, even when it is a DataFrame or a Series.

When the `dispatch_to_series` function is called with a DataFrame `right` parameter (as in the failing test case), it should apply the operation element-wise between the corresponding columns of the input DataFrames `left` and `right`. However, due to the incorrect handling of the `right` parameter within the `column_op` function definitions, the output is incorrect.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `column_op` function definitions to correctly handle different types of the `right` parameter - scalar, DataFrame, or Series. Specifically, we need different implementations for each case to allow for element-wise operation between columns.

The corrected implementation should check the type of the `right` parameter and perform the operation between columns accordingly. When `right` is a scalar, we apply the operation element-wise between the columns of the `left` DataFrame and the scalar value. When `right` is a DataFrame, we perform the operation element-wise between corresponding columns of `left` and `right`. When `right` is a Series and the `axis` is "columns", we operate row-by-row treating the Series as the corresponding row in the DataFrame.

## Corrected Version of the Function

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index) 

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this corrected implementation, the `dispatch_to_series` function should now correctly handle different types of `right` parameters and perform element-wise operations as intended.
