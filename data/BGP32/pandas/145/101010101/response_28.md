### Analysis
The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is intended to evaluate an operation between a DataFrame and either a scalar, another DataFrame, or a Series. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the multiplication operation (`<built-in function mul>`) involving a `numpy.ndarray` and `NaTType`.

The cause of the bug seems to stem from the implementation of the `column_op` function inside `dispatch_to_series`. In the specific case causing the error, the right operand is a Series containing NaT values (`NaTType`). The current implementation of `column_op` is not handling this case correctly, resulting in the TypeError.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the `column_op` function within `dispatch_to_series` to handle the case where the right operand is a Series with `NaT` values. We should ensure that the operation between the DataFrame column and the Series element handles the `NaT` values gracefully.

### Corrected Code
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import numpy as np
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            if pd.api.types.is_timedelta64_dtype(b.dtype):  # Check if Series is of timedelta64 type
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i].value if pd.notnull(b.iloc[i]) else pd.NaT) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            else:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

The corrected code includes a check to handle the case where the Series `right` is of `timedelta64` type. If the Series is of this type, it replaces any `NaT` values with `pd.NaT` before performing the operation.

This adjustment ensures that the `NaT` values in the Series are correctly handled during the operation between the DataFrame and the Series.
