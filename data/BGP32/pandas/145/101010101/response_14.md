### Analysis
The error occurs when trying to perform the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing NaT values. NaT (Not a Time) represents missing or undefined datetime values. The error arises from the inability to perform the multiplication operation between a numpy array and NaT type.

### Bug Explanation
1. The function `dispatch_to_series` is designed to dispatch the operation column-by-column to Series implementation based on the type of input values.
2. In the failing test case, the right input value is a Series containing NaT values, causing a conflict when trying to perform the operation.
3. The problem occurs in the definition of `column_op` functions within `dispatch_to_series`, where it tries to perform the operation using a numpy array and the NaT value.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Update the `column_op` function to handle cases involving NaN values appropriately.
2. Introduce a check to bypass the multiplication operation if NaN values are present in the operation.

### Corrected code

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    # with non-unique columns.

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            # Handle NaN values
            if np.isscalar(b) and np.isnan(b):
                return {i: b for i in range(len(a.columns))}  # Skip operation
            else:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            # Handle NaN values
            if np.isscalar(b) and np.isnan(b):
                return {i: b for i in range(len(a.columns))}  # Skip operation
            else:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By adding the conditional checks to handle NaN values in the `column_op` functions, we ensure that the operation is only performed when a scalar value other than NaN is present. This correction will prevent the TypeError caused by trying to multiply a numpy array with a NaT value.
