The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function stems from the fact that `NaT` (Not a Time) values are not fully supported for arithmetic operations in Pandas. The error message specifically mentions that the operation `*` (multiplication) between an array and `NaT` results in a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `NaT` values are encountered during the operation. One approach to handle this is to convert the `NaT` values to a compatible type before performing the operation. 

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        if np.issubdtype(right.dtype, np.datetime64) and right.isna().any():
            right = right.fillna(pd.Timedelta(0))

        if isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
            assert right._indexed_same(left)

            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

        elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
            # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
            # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
            assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

        elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
            assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

        else:
            # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
            raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This version of the function includes additional checks to handle the issue with `NaT` values by converting them to a compatible type (`Timedelta`) before performing the arithmetic operation. This change should allow the function to handle the `NaT` values properly and avoid the `TypeError` that was occurring previously.

Please test the updated function with your use case to ensure that it now behaves correctly.
