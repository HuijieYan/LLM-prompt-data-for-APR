### Analysis
1. The `dispatch_to_series` function is designed to evaluate frame operations by dispatching column-by-column to the Series implementation.
2. The error occurs during an arithmetic operation involving a DataFrame and a Series where the Series has `NaT` values.
3. The error arises from a mismatch in types during the operations with `NaT` values.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where one of the operands is `NaT`.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `column_op` functions defined inside the `dispatch_to_series` function to handle the case where one of the operands is `NaT`. We can use the `notna` function to check if the values are not missing before performing the arithmetic operation.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import numpy as np
    from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_scalar, notna
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)

    def column_op(a, b):
        return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if notna(b.iloc[i]) else np.nan for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
``` 

This corrected version of the function should now handle the case where one of the operands is `NaT` correctly. Run the failing test case after applying this fix to verify that it passes successfully.
