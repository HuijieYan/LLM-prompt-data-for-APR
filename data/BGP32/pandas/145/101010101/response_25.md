### Analysis
The error message indicates that the bug occurs when trying to perform an unsupported operation between a NumPy array and a 'NaTType' value (representing 'Not A Time') during the evaluation of the arithmetic operation in the `_evaluate_standard` function. This error is due to the improper handling of the 'NaTType' value in the column_op function, where the function tries to perform arithmetic operations involving this special value.

### Bug
The bug lies in the `column_op` function within the `dispatch_to_series` function. Specifically, in the case when `right` is an `ABCSeries` and `axis` is not specified, the function tries to perform an operation involving the 'NaTType' value which leads to a `TypeError`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `column_op` function to handle the 'NaT' values properly when performing arithmetic operations with NumPy arrays. We should skip these 'NaT' values and not perform the operation with them.

### Corrected Version
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if pd.notna(b.iloc[i]) else np.nan for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if pd.notna(b) else np.nan for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
``` 

By implementing this correction, the function should now properly handle operations involving 'NaT' values when performing arithmetic operations between a DataFrame and a Series.
