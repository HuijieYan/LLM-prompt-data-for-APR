### Analyzing the buggy function and the error message

The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is called with a DataFrame `left`, a Series `right`, a scalar function, and an `axis` parameter. The function is designed to apply the function `func` (e.g., multiplication) column-by-column between the DataFrame and the Series.

The error occurs when the function reaches the point where it needs to evaluate the operation between the DataFrame column `a` and the Series `b`. The error message indicates that the operation is not supported between a numpy array and a 'NaTType' (representing a missing value in pandas).

The expected input consists of a DataFrame, a Series, and the operation `mul` (multiplication) between them.

### Error Location and Cause
The error occurs because the `mul` operation between a numpy array and a 'NaTType' raises a `TypeError` due to an unsupported operand type for the multiplication operation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
We need to handle the case where the operation is applied between a DataFrame column and a Series that contains 'NaT' values explicitly. One way to fix the bug is to modify the `column_op` function inside the `dispatch_to_series` function to handle this scenario. We can check for 'NaT' values in the Series and treat them differently. 

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if b.iloc[i] is not pd.NaT else pd.NaT for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if b.iloc[i] is not pd.NaT else pd.NaT for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
``` 

With this modification, we explicitly handle the case where 'NaT' values are present in the Series `right`, ensuring that the operation does not fail due to unsupported operand types.
