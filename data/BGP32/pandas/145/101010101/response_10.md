### Analysis
- The error message indicates that there is an issue with the operation between a numpy array and a NaTType (Not a Time) object.
- The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is intended to evaluate frame operations column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.
- The problem seems to be with how the operation is handled for the case where the right input is of type NaT and needs to be broadcasted across the DataFrame columns.

### Bug
The bug originates when the right input is a NaT (Not a Time) value that needs to be operated with each column of the DataFrame.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the right input is NaT separately from other cases and ensure that the operation is carried out correctly with each column of the DataFrame.

### Updated Function
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i % len(b)]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By updating the `column_op` functions for different cases, we ensure that the operation with NaT values is correctly applied to each column of the DataFrame when needed. This should resolve the issue with the operation between numpy array and NaTType.
