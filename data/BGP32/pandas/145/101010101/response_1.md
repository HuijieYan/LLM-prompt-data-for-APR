### Analysis
The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is supposed to evaluate the frame operation `func(left, right)` by operating column-by-column and dispatching to the Series implementation. The function has different cases depending on the type of `right` parameter, such as scalar, DataFrame, or Series. The error occurs when the `right` parameter is of type `Series` and the `op` is a multiplication operation. The error happens because the function `column_op` tries to perform the operation `op(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i])`, where indexing using `i` on a scalar Series like `NaT` raises an error.

### Bug
The bug occurs because when `right` is a Series and `axis` is not "columns", the function tries to access `b.iloc[i]`, which causes an error due to `b` being a scalar Series.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `column_op` function to handle the case where `b` is a scalar Series correctly. We can check if `b` is scalar and adjust the operation accordingly.

### Corrected Function
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            if lib.is_scalar(b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            else:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By including a check for scalar `b` in the `column_op` function for the case where `right` is a Series, we can ensure that the correct operation is performed without causing errors.
