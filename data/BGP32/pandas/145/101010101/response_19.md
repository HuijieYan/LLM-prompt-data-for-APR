### Analysis
The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is designed to handle various scenarios for evaluating frame operations by dispatching to the Series implementation. The error message indicates that the bug occurs when trying to evaluate the operation of multiplying a DataFrame by a Series containing NaT values.

The root cause of the bug is that the implementation of the `column_op` function within `dispatch_to_series` does not handle the case where one of the operands is NaT correctly, leading to a TypeError during the evaluation of the operation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `column_op` function within the `dispatch_to_series` function to handle the case where one of the operands is NaT. We should check for NaT values and handle them appropriately to prevent the TypeError during the operation evaluation.

### Corrected Function
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns) if not pd.isnull(b) else b}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns) if not pd.isnull(b.iloc[i]) else b.iloc[i]}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns) if not pd.isnull(b.iloc[i]) else b.iloc[i]}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns) if not pd.isnull(b) else b}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
``` 

By implementing this corrected version of the function, the bug should be fixed, and the function should now handle the case where one of the operands is NaT correctly.
