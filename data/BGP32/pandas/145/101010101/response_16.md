### Analysis
- The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is responsible for evaluating arithmetic operations column by column in a DataFrame by dispatching to the Series implementation.
- The error occurs when the function tries to perform the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing NaT values.
- The specific error message indicates that there is an unsupported operand type for multiplication: `'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'`
- The function utilizes different column_op functions based on the type of the right input.
- The issue arises in the block of code where `right` is a Series and `axis` is not equal to "columns". This situation leads to assigning `b` as `right` directly, causing issues with the operation.

### Bug
The bug occurs when processing a DataFrame multiplication operation with a Series containing NaT values. The logic within the function does not handle this scenario correctly, leading to a TypeError as it tries to perform the operation between 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'.

### Fix Strategy
We need to update the logic within the function to handle the specific case where `right` is a Series with NaT values. Since the mismatch in operand types causing the error, we should modify the column_op function to handle this scenario appropriately.

### Corrected Version
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns)}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif (isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis != "columns"):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By applying this fix, the function should now correctly handle the case of performing operations between a DataFrame and a Series with NaT values and avoid the TypeError encountered before.
