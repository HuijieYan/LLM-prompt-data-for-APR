### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `dispatch_to_series` function when trying to perform an arithmetic operation involving a DataFrame and a Series. The error message indicates that there is an issue with unsupported operand types for multiplication (`*`) between a NumPy array and `NaT` (Not a Time) type.

Looking at the code, the problem arises when trying to multiply the DataFrame by the Series, which causes the `TypeError` due to the unsupported operation between a NumPy array and `NaT`. The issue lies in how the calculations are being handled within the `dispatch_to_series` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Identify the specific case where the error occurs.
2. Modify the calculation logic in the function to handle the case where the operation involves a DataFrame and a Series.
3. Ensure that the respective columns are operated upon correctly to avoid the unsupported operation error.

### Bug Fix and Corrected Function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By modifying the `column_op` function for the case when `right` is an `ABCSeries` and not operating column by column against the `NaT` values directly, we can avoid the TypeError and correctly perform the operations involving DataFrame and Series.
