### Bug Analysis:
In the buggy `dispatch_to_series` function, the issue arises when the input `right` is a `Series` with a `dtype` of `timedelta64[ns]`, and the operation is multiplication (`<built-in function mul>`), and the `axis` is set to `'columns'`. 

The error occurs when trying to evaluate the operation using `expressions.evaluate`, which then calls `_evaluate_standard` with operands `a` as the DataFrame `left` and `b` as the Series `right`. The error message indicates that the issue is with the operation involving the numpy array `a` and NaT (Not-a-Time) value.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when the operation involves a DataFrame `left` and a Series `right` with `axis='columns'`, the operation should be applied row-wise instead of column-wise. This means applying the operation to corresponding rows of the DataFrame and Series.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    if isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # Apply the operation row-wise when right is a Series and axis is 'columns'
        new_data = {i: func(left.iloc[i], right) for i in range(len(left))}
    else:
        # Apply the operation to corresponding elements normally
        new_data = expressions.evaluate(func, str_rep, left, right)
        
    return new_data
```

By applying the operation row-wise when dealing with a DataFrame and a Series with `axis='columns'`, we ensure the correct operation is performed without running into the unsupported operand type error.

This corrected version should pass the failing test case mentioned and handle the scenario of operating between a DataFrame and a Series with timedelta data type correctly.
