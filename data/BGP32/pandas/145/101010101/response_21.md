### Analysis:
The error occurs when trying to perform an arithmetic operation involving a DataFrame and a Series with missing values (`NaT`). The `dispatch_to_series` function is designed to evaluate column-wise operations between a DataFrame and another data structure. In this case, the issue arises when trying to multiply a DataFrame by a Series containing `NaT` values.

The `column_op` inner function defined within `dispatch_to_series` is used to perform the actual column-wise operation. The problem lies in the implementation of this `column_op` function when dealing with missing values (`NaT`).

### Bug:
The bug occurs because the `column_op` function does not handle the case where a column in the DataFrame is multiplied by `NaT`. This leads to a `TypeError` where an unsupported operand type (`NaTType`) is used in the multiplication operation.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the implementation of the `column_op` function to properly handle situations where `NaT` values are involved. We should modify the function to check for `NaT` values and handle them appropriately.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    
    def handle_mult_by_nat(a, b):
        if pd.isna(b):
            return a
        else:
            return func(a, b)
        
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: handle_mult_by_nat(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: handle_mult_by_nat(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: handle_mult_by_nat(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: handle_mult_by_nat(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By incorporating the `handle_mult_by_nat` function to handle cases where a column is multiplied by `NaT`, we ensure that the operation is properly handled and the bug is resolved. This corrected version should pass the failing test case mentioned.
