### Analysis:
The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is supposed to evaluate frame operations column-by-column by dispatching to the Series implementation. The error occurs when trying to evaluate the operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing `NaT` values. The specific error message indicates an unsupported operand type for multiplication operation between a numpy array and `NaTType`.

### Bug:
The bug occurs because the function tries to perform an arithmetic operation between a DataFrame and a Series with `NaT` values, causing the `TypeError`.

### Solution:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `NaT` values are involved. We can modify the implementation of the `column_op` function for this specific case.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isnull(b) else np.nan for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isnull(b) else np.nan for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this corrected implementation, the function will now handle the case of `NaT` values appropriately when performing arithmetic operations between a DataFrame and a Series. This should resolve the `TypeError` that was occurring in the failing test.
