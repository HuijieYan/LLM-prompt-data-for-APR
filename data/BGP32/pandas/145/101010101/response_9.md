### Analysis
1. The `dispatch_to_series` function is designed to evaluate frame operations by dispatching column by column to the Series implementation.
2. The error occurs when trying to evaluate the multiplication operation (`<built-in function mul>`) between a DataFrame (`left`) and a Series with `NaT` values (`right`).
3. The error message indicates that the operation is performed on unsupported operand types for the multiplication operation.
4. The bug is likely related to handling the `NaT` (Not-a-Time) values in the Series during the operation with the DataFrame.

### Bug in the Code
The bug occurs when trying to perform the operation between a DataFrame column and a Series that contains `NaT` values. The implementation in `column_op` to handle this specific case does not correctly handle the `NaT` values.

### Solution Strategy
We need to handle the case where the right operand contains `NaT` values in the `dispatch_to_series` function. This handling should involve properly skipping the `NaT` values during the operation.

### Corrected Code
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns) if not pd.isna(b))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns) if b.iloc[:, i].notna())}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns) if pd.notna(b.iloc[i]))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns) if pd.notna(b[i]))}

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By adding checks for `pd.notna` in the `column_op` function, the code should now handle the `NaT` values correctly and skip them during the operation. This correction should resolve the issue identified in the failing test case.
