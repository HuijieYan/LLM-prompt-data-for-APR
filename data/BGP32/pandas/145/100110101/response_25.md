### Analysis:
The error occurs when the `dispatch_to_series` function is called with a DataFrame `left` and a Series `right` of dtype `timedelta64[ns]`. The `func` being used is the multiplication operator `mul`. The error arises from the `column_op` function, specifically in handling the case where `b` (right) is an ndarray of dtype `'timedelta64[ns]'`.

The bug originates from the mismatch between the datatype of the Series `right` and the handling within the `column_op` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by attempting to perform the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series with dtype `timedelta64[ns]`. This operation is not handled correctly within the `column_op` function, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to apply the operation on elements containing NaT.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `column_op` function to handle the multiplication operation with timedelta dtype correctly by considering the presence of NaT values. By properly handling the timedelta operations, we can ensure that the operation is applied successfully without causing errors.

### Updated Corrected Function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        def column_op(a, b):
            if b.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]':
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            else:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By adding a conditional check in the `column_op` function to handle the case when `b` has a dtype of `timedelta64[ns]`, we can ensure that the operation is applied correctly without causing a `TypeError`. This fix addresses the bug and allows the `dispatch_to_series` function to handle timedelta dtype operations appropriately.
