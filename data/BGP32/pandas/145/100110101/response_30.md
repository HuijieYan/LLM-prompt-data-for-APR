The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is causing a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'` error. This error occurs when trying to perform arithmetic operations on a DataFrame with a Series that contains `'NaT'` values.

The bug lies in the `column_op` function where it tries to apply the arithmetic operation between a DataFrame and a Series. In the case where the right operand is a Series and `axis!="columns"`, the operation is meant to be applied element-wise across the rows of the DataFrame.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `column_op` function to correctly handle the case where the right operand is a Series and we are not operating along columns. We will adjust the logic in `column_op` to handle this scenario properly.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis != "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version of the function should handle the operation correctly based on the type of operands and the specified axis. This fix ensures that the operation between a DataFrame and a Series with 'NaT' values behaves as expected.

After applying this fix, the failing test should pass and produce the expected output.
