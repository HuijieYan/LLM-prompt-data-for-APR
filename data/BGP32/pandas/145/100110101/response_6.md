To fix the bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function, we need to handle the case where the right input is a `NaT` value when performing multiplication with a DataFrame. The current implementation doesn't account for this scenario, leading to a TypeError during execution.

The cause of the bug is that the function doesn't handle the case of multiplying a DataFrame by a Series containing `NaT` values properly. The error occurs when the function tries to perform the multiplication operation with an invalid operand type, resulting in a TypeError.

To fix the bug, we need to add a specific condition to check for `NaT` values in the right Series and replace them with appropriate values before performing the operation. 

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], pd.to_timedelta(b.iloc[i], errors='coerce')) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, we added a condition inside the `column_op` function for handling `NaT` values by converting them to proper timedelta values using `pd.to_timedelta` with the `errors='coerce'` parameter. This modification ensures that the operation between the DataFrame and the Series with `NaT` values proceeds without raising an error.

After applying this fix, the `dispatch_to_series` function should now successfully handle the case where `NaT` values are present in the Series being multiplied with a DataFrame.
