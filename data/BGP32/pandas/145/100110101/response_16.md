## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `dispatch_to_series` function when trying to perform arithmetic operations involving a DataFrame and a Series with "NaT" values. The bug arises due to a mismatch in the handling of `NaT` values in the `column_op` function.

When attempting to apply the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing "NaT" values, the function fails to handle the `NaT` values correctly, leading to a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'` error.

The problem lies in the `column_op` function's implementation, specifically in the case where `right` is a Series and comparison of indexes or column names is not being handled correctly.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `column_op` function in the `dispatch_to_series` function to correctly handle the case when `right` is a Series and handle `NaT` values appropriately when performing the arithmetic operation. We need to ensure that the `NaT` values do not disrupt the operation.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i] if pd.notnull(b.iloc[i]) else pd.Timedelta('0 days')) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By adding the condition `if pd.notnull(b.iloc[i]) else pd.Timedelta('0 days')` in the `column_op` function for the case where `right` is an `ABCSeries`, we ensure that any `NaT` values in the Series are replaced with a value that does not disrupt the operation. This modification will address the `TypeError` caused by the presence of `NaT` values during the arithmetic operation.
