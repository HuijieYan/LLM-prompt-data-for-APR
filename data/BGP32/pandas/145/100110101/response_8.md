### Bug Analysis
- The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is trying to perform element-wise operations between a DataFrame and either a scalar, another DataFrame, or a Series. 
- The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` specifically tests multiplication between a DataFrame `df` and a Series `ser` containing NaN values in the form of NaT (Not a Time).
- The error message indicates a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'`, which suggests an issue with handling multiplication involving NaT values.
- The expected output of the test is a DataFrame where each column is multiplied by the corresponding element in the Series `ser`, with NaN values where the corresponding element in `ser` is NaT.

### Bug Explanation
- The bug occurs because the `dispatch_to_series` function does not handle operations involving NaT values appropriately. When trying to perform element-wise multiplication between the DataFrame and Series, the presence of NaT values in the Series causes the TypeError because NaT cannot be directly used in arithmetic operations.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Check for NaT values in the Series `right`.
2. Handle the case where NaT values are present accordingly to prevent the TypeError during element-wise operations.
3. Ensure that the final output follows the expected behavior even when NaN values (NaT) are involved.

### Corrected Implementation
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], np.where(b == np.datetime64('NaT'), np.nan, b.iloc[i])) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], np.where(b == np.datetime64('NaT'), np.nan, b)) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By using `np.where` to replace NaT values with NaN in the Series `right` before performing element-wise operations in the `column_op` functions, we can handle the presence of NaT values and ensure the correct behavior during arithmetic operations involving NaN values.
