Based on the provided buggy function and failing test case, the bug seems to lie in the handling of operations involving a DataFrame and a Series of timedelta values.

### Cause of the Bug:
When the `dispatch_to_series` function is called with a DataFrame `left` and a Series `right` containing `NaT` timedelta values, the error occurs during the evaluation of the operation. The function does not handle the case where the operation involves `'numpy.ndarray'` and `'NaTType'` operands, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to multiply the `numpy.ndarray` values with `NaT`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the implementation of the `column_op` function inside the `dispatch_to_series` function to properly handle the operation of `numpy.ndarray` values with `NaT` timedelta values. We can iterate over the columns of the DataFrame and check for `NaT` values in the Series before performing the operation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    
    def column_op(a, b):
        result = {}
        for i in range(len(a.columns)):
            if pd.isna(b.iloc[i]):
                result[i] = np.nan
            else:
                result[i] = func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i])
        return result

    right = pd.api.types.to_numeric(right, errors='coerce')
    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In this corrected version, we convert the `right` Series to numeric values (coercing 'NaT' to `np.nan`) before performing the operation column-wise. This modification ensures that the operation handles `NaN` values correctly and avoids the `TypeError` caused by attempting to perform arithmetic with `NaTType`.

By implementing this fixed version of the function, the provided failing test case should pass without any errors.
