### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs in the `na_arithmetic_op` function within the `array_ops.py` file. The error arises from the unsupported operation between a numpy array and a NaTType. This problem is triggered during the execution of the failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` when trying to operate a DataFrame with a Series of `timedelta64` containing NaT values.

### Bug Location
The bug is located in the `_evaluate_standard` function within `expressions.py`, specifically at the line `return op(a, b)`. The error occurs because the operation `<built-in function mul>` (multiplication) is being performed between a numpy array containing values `[1, 3]` and a NaT value.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by attempting an invalid operation between a numpy array and a NaTType. Numpy does not support direct operations between an array and NaT values, leading to the TypeError exception.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to implement a check in the `_evaluate_standard` function before executing the operation. This check should handle the case when one of the operands is a NaT value, ensuring that the operation is only performed on valid values. Additionally, we need to update the `column_op` function in the `dispatch_to_series` function to handle this scenario appropriately.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if not pd.isnat(b.iloc[i]) else b.iloc[i] for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isnat(b) else b for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version handles the case where a NaT value is encountered during the operation in the `column_op` function. It ensures that the operation is only performed when the right operand is not a NaT value, avoiding the TypeError exception.
