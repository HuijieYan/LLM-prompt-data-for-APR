## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is designed to handle operations between DataFrames and scalars/DataFrames/Series. In the failing test case, the function is being called with a DataFrame (`df`) and a Series (`ser`) both containing `NaT` values of dtype `timedelta64[ns]`. The specific operation causing the error is the multiplication operation (`*`).

The error message indicates a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'`, which suggests that the `NaT` values in the Series are causing issues during the multiplication operation with the DataFrame.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to handle the special case of performing arithmetic operations (like multiplication) involving `NaT` values correctly. Since arithmetic operations with `NaT` values can result in errors, we need to ensure that these operations are handled appropriately.

1. Modify the `column_op` function in `dispatch_to_series` to handle `NaT` values when performing arithmetic operations between DataFrames and Series.
2. Add specific checks and logic to handle `NaT` values in the arithmetic operation involving the `NaT` values in the Series.
3. Ensure that the corrected function properly evaluates the arithmetic operation without errors when `NaT` values are involved.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
  
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if not pd.isna(b.iloc[i]) else float('nan') for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isna(b.iloc[i]) else float('nan') for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
``` 

By updating the `column_op` functions to handle `NaT` values when performing arithmetic operations, the corrected function should now properly handle the multiplication operation between the DataFrame and the Series containing `NaT` values, resolving the TypeError issue.
