The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to arise from how it handles the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing timedelta values. The error message indicates that the function is trying to perform multiplication between a NumPy array and a `NaTType`, which is unsupported.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `column_op` function in the `dispatch_to_series` function to handle the case where the right operand is a Series with timedelta values. Specifically, we should check if the right operand is a Series with timedelta values and operate row-by-row instead of column-by-column.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and isinstance(right.array, ABCTimedeltaArray):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle timedelta Series

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this correction, the `column_op` function now explicitly checks if the right operand is a Series containing timedelta values. In such cases, it processes the operation row-by-row to handle the timedelta values correctly.

This correction should address the issue and make the failing test case `test_td64_op_nat_casting` pass successfully.
