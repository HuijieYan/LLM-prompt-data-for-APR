### Analysis
The error occurs when trying to perform a multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing `NaT` values. The error message indicates that there is an unsupported operand type for the `*` operation: `'numpy.ndarray'` and `'NaTType'`.

Looking at the buggy function, the `dispatch_to_series` function is receiving a DataFrame (`left`), a scalar or DataFrame (`right`), an operator (`func`), and other parameters. It then tries to evaluate the operation column-by-column by dispatching to the Series implementation. The issue arises when trying to perform operations on the columns with `NaT` values in the Series.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `column_op` function in the `dispatch_to_series` function. When it encounters a Series with `NaT` values, it tries to apply the operator by iterating over the individual items in the Series. However, the presence of `NaT` values leads to unsupported operand types.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `column_op` function to handle the case where the right input contains `NaT` values. One approach could be to check for `NaT` values before applying the operator on elements.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd

    right = pd.to_timedelta(right, errors='coerce')  # Convert 'NaT' strings to pd.NaT
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            if pd.isna(b):  # Check for 'NaT'
                return {i: b for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
``` 

This corrected version includes a check within the `column_op` function to handle `NaT` values appropriately by returning the `NaT` directly without attempting the operation.
