### Bug Analysis:
The error message indicates that there is an issue with performing the operation '*' (multiplication) between a numpy array and a NaT (Not-a-Time) value. This is likely due to a mismatch in operand types where the operation '*' is being applied to an array and a NaT value which is unsupported.

#### Bug Location:
The bug is likely occurring in the `na_arithmetic_op` function in the `array_ops.py` file, which is called during the operation evaluation process.

#### Cause of the Bug:
1. The function `na_arithmetic_op` is expecting two numpy arrays for the 'left' and 'right' inputs but is receiving a NaT value instead of a numpy array.
2. The error occurs when the function attempts to perform the operation between the numpy array and the NaT value, resulting in a `TypeError`.

#### Proposed Fix Strategy:
1. Check the input types to ensure that both 'left' and 'right' inputs are numpy arrays before performing the operation.
2. Handle the case when the 'right' input is a scalar or a non-numpy array separately to avoid the TypeError.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    left_values = left.values

    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        right_values = np.full_like(left_values, right)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        right_values = right.values

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        right_values = right.values.reshape(1, -1)
    
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        right_values = right.values.reshape(-1, 1)
    
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    def column_op(a, b):
        return {i: func(a[:, i], b[i]) for i in range(a.shape[1])}

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left_values, right_values)
    return new_data
```

By modifying the function to handle different types of 'right' input appropriately and ensuring that both 'left' and 'right' inputs are numpy arrays, the bug can be fixed.
