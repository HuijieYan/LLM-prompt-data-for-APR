### Analysis
The error message indicates a `TypeError` with the message `unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'`. This error occurs when trying to perform the multiplication operation (`*`) between a numpy array (`numpy.ndarray`) and a NaT value.

The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is called during DataFrame arithmetic, specifically when multiplying a DataFrame by a Series containing NaT values. The issue seems to arise in the `column_op` function, where the multiplication operation is performed between the DataFrame columns and the NaT values.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by trying to perform element-wise multiplication (`*`) between a DataFrame column and a NaT value, which is not supported in numpy operations. This causes a `TypeError` due to the unsupported operand types.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where one of the operands is NaT (Not-a-Time) appropriately. Since NaT represents missing values in pandas, we should treat it as a missing value when performing operations with numpy arrays.

### Corrected Function
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    def safe_op(op, a, b):
        mask = ~b.isna()
        result = np.empty(len(a), dtype=float)
        result[mask] = op(a[mask], b[mask])
        result[~mask] = np.nan
        return result

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right, safe_op=safe_op)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected function, a new `safe_op` function is introduced to handle operations between numpy arrays and NaT values by ignoring the missing values while performing the operation. This approach ensures that the operation does not fail when dealing with NaT values.
