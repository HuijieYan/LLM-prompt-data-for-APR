### Analysis
The error message indicates that there is an issue with the multiplication operation (`*`) between the DataFrame `df` and the Series `ser` containing `NaT` values. The error is caused by an unsupported operand type for multiplication: `'numpy.ndarray'` and `'NaTType'`.

The function involved in this issue is `dispatch_to_series` which is used to evaluate arithmetic or comparison operations between a DataFrame and either a scalar, another DataFrame, or a Series. The error occurs when trying to perform the operation column-wise, generating arrays of different types which are not compatible for operation.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function `column_op` in `dispatch_to_series` is not handling the case when the right operand is a Series containing `NaT` values correctly. This leads to generation of numpy arrays which include `NaT` values, causing the TypeError during evaluation.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `column_op` function in the `dispatch_to_series` method to handle the `NaT` values properly when operating on a column-wise basis.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if b.iloc[i] != pd.NaT else pd.NaT for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function should now handle the case of operating with a Series containing `NaT` values more appropriately, preventing the TypeError that was occurring before.
