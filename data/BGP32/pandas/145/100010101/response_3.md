### Analysis
The error message indicates that there is an issue with the multiplication operation between a NumPy array and a NaT (Not a Time) value. The error arises from the `_evaluate_standard` function in `expressions.py` when trying to perform the multiplication operation.

### Bug Explanation
1. The `dispatch_to_series` function is expecting to perform an element-wise operation between a DataFrame `left` and a Series `right`.
2. The input `right` is a Series containing NaT values of type `timedelta64[ns]`.
3. When the function tries to perform the operation using the `evaluate` function, it eventually reaches the `_evaluate_standard` function where the multiplication operation is attempted.
4. Multiplying a NumPy array (representing a column of the DataFrame) with a NaT value results in a TypeError due to unsupported operand types.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we should handle the case where the operation involves a NumPy array and a NaT value. We should filter out the NaT values before performing the operation to avoid the TypeError.

### Corrected Function
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            # Filter out NaT values from b before performing the operation
            mask = ~b.isna()
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i][mask], b[mask]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

The corrected function now filters out NaT values from the Series `right` before performing the operation between the DataFrame column and the Series to avoid the TypeError.
