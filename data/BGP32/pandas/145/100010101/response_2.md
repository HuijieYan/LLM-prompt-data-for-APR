### Bug Analysis:
The error message indicates a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'`, which suggests that the function is attempting to perform a multiplication operation involving a NumPy array and a 'NaT' (Not a Time) value.

Looking at the `dispatch_to_series` function, it handles different cases based on the type of `right` parameter. The issue seems to arise when `right` is a Series with dtype 'timedelta64[ns]' containing 'NaT'. The `column_op` function defined inside the conditional block for `isinstance(right, ABCSeries)` is causing the problem, specifically when trying to apply the arithmetic operation between `a.iloc[:, i]` (a column of the DataFrame) and `b` (which is 'NaT').

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, we need to update the `column_op` function logic to handle the case when dealing with 'NaT' values appropriately. We should exclude the 'NaT' values from the computation to avoid the TypeError.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases with non-unique columns
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
    
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if not pd.isnull(b.iloc[i]) else b.iloc[i] 
                   for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function includes a check inside the `column_op` function to skip the computation involving 'NaT' values by using `pd.isnull` check. This change should prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring during the operation involving NumPy arrays and 'NaT' values.
