### Analysis
The error message indicates that there is an issue with the multiplication operation (`'*'`) between the DataFrame `left` and the Series `right`, specifically due to the unsupported operand types of 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'.

The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is trying to evaluate the frame operation `func(left, right)` by dispatching to the Series implementation. The error occurs during the evaluation process when the `expressions.evaluate` function is called.

The expected input parameters include a DataFrame `left`, a Series `right` containing `NaT` values, and the desired operation function `func` as multiplication (`'*'`). The function should apply the multiplication operation column-wise for each element in the DataFrame and the corresponding element in the Series.

### Bug
The bug is in the implementation of the `column_op` function within the `dispatch_to_series` function. In the case when `right` is a Series and `axis != "columns"`, the function should iterate over the columns of the DataFrame and apply the operation with the corresponding row of the Series. However, the bug causes it to iterate over the columns and directly apply the operation with the Series itself, causing the unsupported operand type error.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `column_op` function to handle the case when `right` is a Series and `axis != "columns"` correctly. We should modify the logic to iterate over the columns and apply the operation with the correct element of the Series.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        if axis == "columns":
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        else:
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version ensures that when `right` is a Series and `axis != "columns"` the function applies the operation correctly column by column with the corresponding values from the Series.
