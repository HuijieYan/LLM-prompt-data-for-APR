The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is likely due to the incorrect handling of the cases when `right` is a Series and `axis` is set to `'columns'`.

### Bug Explanation:
- When `right` is a Series and `axis` is set to `'columns'`, the function should operate row-by-row, matching the index of the Series with the columns of the DataFrame. However, the current implementation mistakenly tries to access the Series elements by index which leads to incorrect behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly handle the case when `right` is a Series and `axis` is set to `'columns'`. We should match the index of the Series with the columns of the DataFrame to operate row-by-row.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
    
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.loc[a.index]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)
    
    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

### Changes Made:
- In the case where `right` is a Series and `axis` is set to `'columns'`, updated the `column_op` function to match the index of the Series (`b`) with the index of the DataFrame columns (`a.index`) when performing the operation.

By making this adjustment, the function should now correctly handle the case where `right` is a Series and `axis` is set to `'columns'`, fixing the bug in the original implementation.
