### Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided function `dispatch_to_series` arises when the input `right` is a Series with non-matching index compared to the DataFrame `left`, and `axis` is set to `'columns'`. In this case, the function incorrectly assumed that the index of the Series should match the columns of the DataFrame to perform element-wise operations, leading to the NotImplementedError being raised.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to handle the case where `right` is a Series and `axis` is set to `'columns'` correctly by matching the index of the Series with the columns of the DataFrame. We can achieve this by updating the if condition block that checks for the type of `right` being an ABCSeries and `axis` being `'columns'`.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the function with the bug fixed:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.loc[a.columns[i]]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This correction ensures that when `right` is a Series and `axis` is set to `'columns'`, the function matches the index of the Series with the columns of the DataFrame for proper element-wise operations.
