The bug in the provided function `dispatch_to_series` seems to be related to how the operation is performed between the DataFrame `left` and the Series `right`. The function is supposed to dispatch the operation based on certain conditions like the type of `right` and the value of `axis`.

Based on the provided runtime values and types, it seems that the issue arises when dealing with a Series `right` and the `axis` being `'columns'`. The function attempts to perform the operation row-by-row (`iloc[i]`), but encounters a problem with handling timedelta data in the Series.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the way the operation is done when the `axis` is set to `'columns'`. Specifically, we need to iterate over the columns of the DataFrame `a` and apply the operation between each column of `a` and the whole Series `b`.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # Applying operation column-wise to left and right Series
        return {i: func(left.iloc[:, i], right) for i in range(len(left.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In this corrected version, when `right` is a Series and `axis` is set to `'columns'`, the operation is directly applied column-wise between each column of the DataFrame `a` and the Series `b`.

This modification should address the bug and ensure correct processing of the operation in the specified scenario.
