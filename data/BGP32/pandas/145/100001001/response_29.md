The bug in the provided function is due to an incorrect handling of the `right` input parameter when it is a Series and the `axis` is set to "columns". The function is supposed to perform column-wise operations between the DataFrame `left` and the Series `right`. However, in the case when `right` is a Series and axis is "columns", the function tries to access `iloc[i]` on the Series `b`, which is incorrect.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the `column_op` function when `right` is a Series and `axis` is "columns" to correctly handle row-wise operations. We can achieve this by iterating over the rows of the DataFrame `a` and matching each row with the corresponding value in the Series `b`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
    
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # Perform row-wise operations when right is a Series and axis is "columns"
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This correction ensures that when `right` is a Series and `axis` is set to "columns", the function correctly performs row-wise operations between the DataFrame `left` and the Series `right`. This should resolve the bug and make the function work as intended for the given input scenario and other similar cases.
