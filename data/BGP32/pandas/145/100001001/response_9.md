The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function lies in the handling of the cases where `right` is a Series and `axis` is either `'columns'` or not provided. In these cases, the function is attempting to perform element-wise operations between the DataFrame `left` and the Series `right`, which results in mismatched dimensions.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `column_op` function to handle the element-wise operation correctly. We should iterate over the rows of the DataFrame `a` and perform the operation with the corresponding value from Series `b`.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # Perform row-wise operation
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By making this adjustment to handle row-wise operations when `right` is a Series and `axis` is `'columns'`, the function should now correctly perform element-wise operations between the DataFrame and Series inputs, resolving the bug.
