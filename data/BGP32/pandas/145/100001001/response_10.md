The bug in the provided function `dispatch_to_series` seems to be in the handling of the `right` parameter, specifically when it is a Series and the `axis` is set to `'columns'`.

Looking at the provided runtime values for Case 1:
- The `right` parameter is a Series with an index of `RangeIndex(start=0, stop=2, step=1)`.
- The `left` parameter is a DataFrame with columns and index both as `RangeIndex(start=0, stop=2, step=1)`.
- The `axis` parameter is set to `'columns'`.

In the function, when `right` is a Series and `axis` is `'columns'`, the function is trying to access `b.iloc[i]`, where `b` corresponds to the Series (`right`) passed as input. However, Accessing Series with DataFrame indexing is leading to the bug in the function.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the code handling the case when `right` is a Series and `axis` is `'columns'`. We should directly operate on the columns of both the DataFrame `left` and the Series `right`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # Operate directly on columns
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        new_data = {}
        for i in range(len(left.columns)):
            new_data[i] = func(left.iloc[:, i], right)

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    if isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        return pd.DataFrame(new_data)
    else:
        new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
        return new_data
```

This corrected version directly operates on the columns of the DataFrame `left` and the Series `right` when the condition `isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns"` is met. This update should address the bug in the function.
