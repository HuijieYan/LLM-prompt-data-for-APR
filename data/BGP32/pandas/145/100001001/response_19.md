The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function lies in the creation of the `column_op` function for handling different types of `right` inputs.

### Cause of the bug:
When the input `right` is a Series and `axis` is set to `'columns'`, the function should operate row-by-row. However, the current implementation incorrectly treats it as another case where it should operate column-by-column. This leads to the incorrect behavior and raises an assertion error.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `column_op` function for the case when `right` is a Series and `axis` is set to `'columns'`. We should modify the way the function loops over the columns and rows to handle row-wise operations correctly.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[i], b) for i in range(len(a))}
            
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By updating the `column_op` function to correctly handle row-wise operations when `right` is a Series and `axis` is set to `'columns', the bug in the function should be fixed.
