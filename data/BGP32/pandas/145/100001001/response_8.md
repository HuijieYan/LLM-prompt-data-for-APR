The bug in the provided function `dispatch_to_series` is likely due to the mismatch in dimensions when applying the function `func` between the DataFrame `left` and the series `right`. 

Given the runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables, we can observe the following:
- The `left` DataFrame has columns and index with `RangeIndex` values.
- The `right` Series has a `RangeIndex` as the index.
- The function `func` is set to multiplication (`<built-in function mul>`).
- The `axis` parameter is set to `'columns'`.

Based on the above information, it is clear that the bug occurs when trying to apply the function `func` (multiplication) between the DataFrame `left` and the Series `right` since the Series has an index that is different from the DataFrame's index or columns.

To fix the bug, we need to align the indices properly before performing the operation. We can achieve this by using the `align` method provided by pandas to align the indices of the DataFrame and the Series before applying the function `func`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        a, b = left, right.align(left, axis=0, join='inner')[1]

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later
        a, b = left, right.align(left, axis=0, join='inner')[1]

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, a, b)
    return new_data
```

In this corrected version, we added the `align` method to align the indices of the DataFrame `left` and the Series `right` before performing the operation. This ensures that the dimensions match correctly before applying the function `func`.
