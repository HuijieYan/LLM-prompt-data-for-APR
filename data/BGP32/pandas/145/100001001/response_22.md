The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be related to the handling of operations between a DataFrame and a Series when `axis='columns'`. 

In the provided example, the function encounters an `NotImplementedError` because it fails to handle the case when `right` is a Series, `axis='columns'`, and the indices of the Series and DataFrame do not match.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly handle this case by aligning the indices before performing the operation.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # Align the index before operations
        right_aligned = right.reindex(left.columns)
        
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.loc[left.index[i]]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right_aligned)
    return new_data
```

In this corrected version, when `right` is a Series and `axis='columns'`, we first align the index of the Series with the columns of the DataFrame before performing the operation. This ensures that the indices match before the operation is applied, resolving the bug.
