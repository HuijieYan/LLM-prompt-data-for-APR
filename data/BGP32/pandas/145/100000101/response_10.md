The bug in the provided function is that when the input `right` is a Series, the function does not handle the case where the `axis` parameter is set to `'columns'` correctly. The buggy function is trying to access the `right.index` for comparison with `left.columns`, but it is not considering 'columns' alignment specifically.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function so that it correctly handles the case when `right` is a Series and `axis` is set to 'columns'. We will update the function to check both the 'columns' alignment and 'index' alignment separately for more accurate handling.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
    
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        # Handle row-by-row calculation when 'axis' is 'columns'
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[i], b) for i in range(len(a))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version includes a specific condition for handling the case when `right` is a Series and `axis` is set to 'columns', enabling correct column-by-column processing in that scenario.
