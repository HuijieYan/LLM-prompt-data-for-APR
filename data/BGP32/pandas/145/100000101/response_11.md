The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function arises from the incorrect handling of the input data when `right` is a Series and the `axis` is set to `'columns'`. The function tries to perform element-wise operations between the columns of the DataFrame `left` and the Series `right`, but the implementation is flawed.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `column_op` function to correctly handle the operation between the DataFrame columns and the Series elements.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # Perform row-by-row operation between DataFrame columns and Series elements
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {col: func(a[col], b.values) for col in a}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this correction, the function now handles the case where `right` is a Series and the `axis` is set to `'columns'` correctly and performs the row-by-row operation between DataFrame columns and Series elements, as expected in the provided test case.
