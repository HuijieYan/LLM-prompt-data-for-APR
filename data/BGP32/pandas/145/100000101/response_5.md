The bug in the provided function is due to the incorrect handling of the input parameters `right` and `axis`. The function is designed to dispatch operations to series based on the type of `right` and `axis`. However, in the current implementation, the handling of `right` as a Series with `axis='columns'` is problematic.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the function to properly handle cases where `right` is a Series and `axis='columns'`. In this case, we need to operate row-by-row instead of column-by-column.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import numpy as np
    from pandas.core.dtypes.generic import ABCDataFrame, ABCSeries
    from pandas.core.computation.expressions import evaluate

    right = np.atleast_1d(right)
    
    if isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        
        def row_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a))}

        new_data = evaluate(row_op, str_rep, left, right)
        
    else:
        right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
        if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

        elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
            assert right._indexed_same(left)

            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

        elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "index":
            assert right.index.equals(left.index)

            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

        else:
            # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
            raise NotImplementedError(right)

        new_data = evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)

    return new_data
```

This corrected version of the function now properly handles the case where `right` is a Series and `axis='columns'`. It performs a row-wise operation in this specific scenario. Other cases are still handled similarly as in the original function.
