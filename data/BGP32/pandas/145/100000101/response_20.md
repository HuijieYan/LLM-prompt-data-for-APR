The bug in the provided function is that the `column_op` function is not correctly handling the case when `right` is a Series and `axis` is set to `"columns"`. The function `column_op` is supposed to iterate over the columns of the DataFrame `a` and perform the operation between each column and the corresponding element in the Series `b`. However, in this case, the loop is incorrectly trying to access `b.iloc[i]` instead of `b.iloc[i]`.

To fix this bug, the `column_op` function should correctly handle the case where `right` is a Series and `axis` is set to `"columns"`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version ensures that the `column_op` function correctly handles the case when `right` is a Series and `axis` is set to `"columns"`. This fix addresses the issue and aligns with the expected input/output values provided.
