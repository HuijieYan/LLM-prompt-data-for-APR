The bug in the provided function `dispatch_to_series` lies in the way the `right` input parameter is treated and used within the function. The function aims to perform element-wise operations between a DataFrame `left` and a scalar or another DataFrame `right`. However, the handling of `right` as a Series and the subsequent operations are incorrect, leading to unexpected behavior.

The bug arises from the lack of handling for cases where `right` is a Series with `axis='columns'`. The current implementation does not consider this case properly and fails to operate row-by-row as intended.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to correctly handle the scenario when `right` is a Series with `axis='columns'`. We need to adjust the column operation function to align with this specific case to ensure that the operation is performed row-by-row as expected.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        if axis == "columns":
            assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        else:
            assert right.index.equals(left.index)

            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the input scenarios as described and return the expected output for each case.
