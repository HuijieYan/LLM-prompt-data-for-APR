Based on the expected case provided, the buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is failing to handle the case where `right` is a Series and `axis == "columns"`. The issue arises in the portion of the code where it checks for these conditions and constructs the `column_op` function accordingly.

The bug occurs because when `right` is a Series and `axis == "columns"`, the function should operate row-by-row, but the current implementation is incorrectly trying to access columns of the Series `b` which should be applied element-wise instead.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `column_op` function to operate row-by-row when `right` is a Series and `axis == "columns"`. We should modify this part of the code to correctly iterate over rows of the DataFrame `a` and Series `b`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the case where `right` is a Series and `axis == "columns"` by operating row-by-row as expected in the provided test case.
