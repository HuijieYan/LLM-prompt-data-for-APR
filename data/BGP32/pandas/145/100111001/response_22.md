### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is designed to handle operations between DataFrames and other data types (scalars, DataFrames, Series) by dispatching to the Series implementation. The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` tries to multiply a DataFrame by a Series containing `NaT` values. The error occurs when trying to perform the multiplication operation between the DataFrame elements and `NaT`, leading to a `TypeError` due to unsupported operand types.

The key issue lies in the implementation of the `column_op` function inside the `dispatch_to_series` function. When trying to perform the operation between DataFrame elements and `NaT`, it leads to the `TypeError`. This is because the `func` operation is applied element-wise between DataFrame columns and `NaT`, which is not supported operation leading to the error.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the special case of dealing with `NaT` values appropriately when performing the operation between the DataFrame and Series. One approach could be to check for `NaT` values and apply the operation accordingly to avoid the `TypeError`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    # with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns)) if not pd.api.types.is_null(b.iloc[i])}  # Handle operation excluding NaT values

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By modifying the `column_op` function inside the `dispatch_to_series` function to exclude `NaT` values from the operation between DataFrame columns and Series, we address the `TypeError` caused by the unsupported operand types. This fix ensures that the function can handle operations involving `NaT` values appropriately.
