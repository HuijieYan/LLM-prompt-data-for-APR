### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs because the function `na_arithmetic_op` encounters an unsupported operand type error when attempting to evaluate the operation of multiplying a DataFrame with a Series which contains NaT (Not a Time) values. The error happens during the evaluation of the operation using `expressions.evaluate()`.

The main issue lies in the `na_arithmetic_op` function where the operation of multiplying a numpy array (`DataFrame`) with NaT values is not handled correctly, leading to the unsupported operand type error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the operation is handled when encountering NaT values in the Series. We should check for NaT values in the Series and ensure that the arithmetic operation is applied only to non-NaT elements of the arrays. 

### Corrected Function
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if not pd.isna(b.iloc[i]) else b.iloc[i] for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if not pd.isna(b.iloc[i]) else b.iloc[i] for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

### Changes Made
- Modified the `column_op` function for both ABCSeries cases to check for NaT values before applying the operation.
- Added a condition to handle NaN values in the Series by directly assigning them to the result without performing the arithmetic operation.

By making these changes, the corrected function should now handle the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series with NaT values correctly and avoid the unsupported operand type error.
