### Analysis
- The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is designed to handle operations between a DataFrame and either a scalar, another DataFrame, or a Series.
- The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` aims to perform element-wise multiplication between a DataFrame and a Series containing 'NaT' values.
- The error occurs during the evaluation of the operation (`op`) in the `expressions.evaluate` function, where the operation involves an unsupported operand type for multiplication: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'.

### Bug Cause
- The bug is caused by the attempt to perform multiplication between a DataFrame and a Series containing 'NaT' values, leading to an unsupported operand type error when trying to evaluate the operation.

### Fix Strategy
- To resolve the bug, we need to handle the case where 'NaT' values are present in the Series when operating with a DataFrame.
- We should perform the operation by excluding the 'NaT' values, as they are not suitable for arithmetic operations.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns)) if pd.notnull(b.iloc[i])}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns)) if pd.notnull(b.iloc[i])}

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

### Summary
- The corrected function now includes conditions to handle the presence of 'NaT' values in the Series when performing operations with a DataFrame.
- By excluding the 'NaT' values from the operation, the corrected function should now be able to process the element-wise multiplication correctly without raising an error.
