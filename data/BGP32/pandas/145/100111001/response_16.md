### Bug Analysis:
The error message indicates that there is an issue with the multiplication operation (`*`) between a DataFrame and a Series containing `NaT` values. The error stems from the `masked_arith_op` function trying to perform the operation on non-NULL elements only but encountering an unsupported operand type `NaTType`.

#### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the operation between a DataFrame and a Series involving `NaT` values is not handled correctly in the `dispatch_to_series` function. When performing an element-wise operation with `NaT` values, the function fails to handle the operation correctly.

#### Bug Fix Strategy:
To resolve this bug, we need to account for the presence of `NaT` values in the Series when performing element-wise operations with a DataFrame. Specifically, we need to ensure that the operation is handled appropriately for cases where `NaT` values are involved.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if not pd.isna(b.iloc[i]) else b.iloc[i] for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isna(b) else b for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

Applying this correction accounts for handling `NaT` values in the Series appropriately during the element-wise operation with a DataFrame, which should resolve the issue reported in the failing test case.
