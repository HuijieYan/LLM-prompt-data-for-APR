### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is failing to handle the case where the right input is a Series with NaT values (Not-a-Time) in the context of arithmetic operations. The error occurs when trying to perform the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing NaT values.

The specific error message indicates a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'`. This error occurs because the function is attempting to perform multiplication between a numpy array and a NaT value, which is not a valid operation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the implementation of the `column_op` function within the `dispatch_to_series` function to handle the case where the right input is a Series with NaT values. We need to implement a special case for NaT values to ensure the operation behaves correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if not pd.isna(b.iloc[i]) else np.nan for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version includes a check for na values (NaT) in the Series `right` input to handle it appropriately during the arithmetic operation in the `column_op` function. This modification should address the issue identified in the failing test and prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.
