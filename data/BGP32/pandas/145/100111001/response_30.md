The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is related to the handling of the operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing NaT values. In the failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting`, the DataFrame `df` is being multiplied element-wise by a Series `ser` containing NaT values. This operation is causing a TypeError due to unsupported operand types for multiplication.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where the Series contains NaT values properly. The error message indicates that the operation between a numpy array representing the DataFrame and NaT is unsupported.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `column_op` function to handle the case where the right operand is a Series containing NaT values. We should skip the operation if the value is NaT in the Series, as arithmetic operations with NaT are not supported.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns)) if not pd.isna(b)}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns)) if not pd.isna(b.iloc[i])}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By adding the `if not pd.isna(b)` condition in the `column_op` functions where the Series is involved, we ensure that the operation skips NaT values during arithmetic operations, which resolves the TypeError and allows the function to handle NaT values gracefully.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` successfully.
