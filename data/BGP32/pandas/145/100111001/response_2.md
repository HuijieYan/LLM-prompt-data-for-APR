### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs when the `dispatch_to_series` function is called to perform a multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series with values of `NaT` (Not a Time) type. The error message indicates that the operation fails because it encounters an unsupported operand type(s) for multiplication (`*`) between a `numpy.ndarray` and `NaTType`.

### Bug Location
The bug is likely located in the `column_op` function where the multiplication operation is performed between the DataFrame columns and the Series values, specifically for the case when the right input is a Series with `NaT` values.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the existing implementation does not handle the case of multiplication between a DataFrame and a Series with `NaT` values. The multiplication operation does not support the operand types of `numpy.ndarray` and `NaTType`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the right input is a Series with `NaT` values appropriately. This can be achieved by checking for `NaT` values in the Series and handling them separately during the multiplication operation.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """

    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if not pd.isnull(b.iloc[i]) else b.iloc[i] for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isnull(b) else b for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By adding checks for `NaT` values in the Series during the multiplication operation, we can prevent the unsupported operand error and successfully perform the arithmetic operation between the DataFrame and the Series with `NaT` values.
