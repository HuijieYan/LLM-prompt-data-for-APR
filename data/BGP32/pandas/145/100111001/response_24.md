### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs due to the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing NaT values. The function `dispatch_to_series` fails to handle this scenario leading to a `TypeError` during evaluation.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The test case involves multiplying a DataFrame `df` with a Series `ser` containing NaT values.
2. The `dispatch_to_series` function is designed to handle different types of right operands.
3. The error occurs during the evaluation process when trying to perform the multiplication operation on a numpy array and NaT type.
4. The function should handle the case of dealing with NaT values appropriately to avoid the TypeError.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `column_op` function within the `dispatch_to_series` function to account for the special case when the right operand is a Series containing NaT values.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            if b is pd.NaT:
                return {i: pd.NaT for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By updating the `column_op` function to correctly handle the case when the right operand is pd.NaT, the corrected version of the function should now be able to handle the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing NaT values without raising a TypeError.
