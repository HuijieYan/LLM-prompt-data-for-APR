### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs when trying to perform an arithmetic operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing NaT (Not a Time) values. The error happens because the operation is not handled correctly when one of the operands is NaT.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The `dispatch_to_series` function is designed to handle various cases when performing operations between a DataFrame and another object (scalar, DataFrame, or Series).
2. In the failing test, the DataFrame `df` is multiplied by a Series `ser` containing NaT values.
3. The code encounters an error while trying to evaluate the multiplication operation between the DataFrame and the Series due to the presence of NaT values in the Series.
4. The error occurs during the evaluation of the expression in the `_evaluate_standard` function within `expressions.py`. The function tries to execute the multiplication operation (`*`) between `'numpy.ndarray'` (from the DataFrame) and `'NaTType'` (NaT from the Series), leading to a `TypeError`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this issue, we need to handle the case where the Series contains NaT values properly. We should skip the operation for rows corresponding to NaT values. Here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    # with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, (ABCSeries, ABCDataFrame)):
        if isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
            assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        else:
            assert right.index.equals(left.index)

            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if b.iloc[i] is not pd.NaT else pd.NaT for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

### Corrected Version:
The corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function now includes additional checks to handle the case where the Series contains NaT values. It skips the operation for rows corresponding to NaT values instead of directly performing the arithmetic operation, preventing the `TypeError` that occurred in the buggy version.

By applying this fix, the failing test case `test_td64_op_nat_casting` should now pass successfully.
