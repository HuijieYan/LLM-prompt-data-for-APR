### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is designed to evaluate frame operations by dispatching to the Series implementation column-by-column. The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` involves multiplying a DataFrame by a Series containing `NaT` values which results in a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'`.

The error occurs when trying to apply the operation (`*`) between the DataFrame and the Series with `NaT` values. The DataFrame contains regular integer values, while the Series contains `NaT` values. This incompatible combination leads to a TypeError during the operation.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the multiplication operation between the DataFrame with regular integer values and the Series containing `NaT` values gracefully. One way to approach this is to apply the operation only to the non-`NaT` values in the Series and leave `NaT` values as is in the result.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            if isinstance(b, pd.Timedelta):
                return {i: np.where(b.isna(), np.nan, func(a.iloc[:, i], b)) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            else:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version handles the case where the Series contains `NaT` values by checking if the Series element is `NaT` before applying the operation. If it is `NaT`, it leaves the result as `NaN` in the output DataFrame.
