Looking at the failing test and the error message, the issue arises from the operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing `NaT` values of `timedelta64[ns]` dtype. The error occurs during the multiplication operation in the `dispatch_to_series` function.

The problem lies in the `column_op` function defined within `dispatch_to_series`, where it tries to perform element-wise operations between DataFrame columns and the Series values. When encountering a `NaT` value in the Series, the multiplication operation fails due to unsupported operand types.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `column_op` function to handle the `NaT` values appropriately for the multiplication operation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if not pd.isnull(b.iloc[i]) else b.iloc[i] for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isnull(b) else b for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the modified `column_op` functions for handling multiplication, we check for `NaT` values in the Series and replace them with the same value instead of performing the operation. This will prevent the unsupported operand type error when encountering `NaT` values during the multiplication operation.

After applying this fix, the function should be able to handle the multiplication between the DataFrame and Series with `NaT` values correctly.
