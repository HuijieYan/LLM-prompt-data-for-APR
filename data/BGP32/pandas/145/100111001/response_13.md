### Bug Analysis:
The error message indicates a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'`. This error occurs during the multiplication operation between a NumPy array and NaT (Not-a-Time). The bug is likely in the part of the function where the operation is applied to the input data.

### Bug Explanation:
In the `column_op` function within the `dispatch_to_series` function, the bug occurs when the `op` function (multiplication in this case) is applied to the DataFrame `a` and the Series `b`, which contains NaT values. This operation results in the unsupported operand type error due to the mismatch between a NumPy array and NaT.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the operation involves a DataFrame and a Series containing NaT values (timedelta data). One way to handle this is to check for NaT values in the Series before performing the operation and skip the operation for those specific values.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if not pd.isna(b.iloc[i]) else b.iloc[i] for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns)) if not pd.isna(b)}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
``` 

By incorporating the `if not pd.isna(b)` check in the `column_op` function, we can prevent the operation from being applied to NaT values in the Series `b`, thus avoiding the `TypeError` related to unsupported operand types.
