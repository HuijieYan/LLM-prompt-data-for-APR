### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs when trying to perform an arithmetic operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing NaT values. The error message indicates that the operation is unsupported, leading to a TypeError.

The issue stems from the `column_op` function within the `dispatch_to_series` function, where the operation is attempted element-wise between the DataFrame columns and the Series. Since NaT is a specific marker for missing values in pandas, the operation involving NaT results in the unsupported operand error.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the operation involves NaT values properly. One way to approach this is to check for NaT values and handle them separately during the operation.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    
    def handle_nat(x):
        if x is pd.NaT:
            return x
        else:
            return func(x, right)

    def column_op(a, b):
        return {i: handle_nat(a.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left)
    return new_data
```

This corrected version incorporates a `handle_nat` function to handle the case when NaT values are encountered during the operation.

By checking for NaT explicitly and handling it accordingly, the function should now be able to perform the arithmetic operation without raising a TypeError related to unsupported operand types.
