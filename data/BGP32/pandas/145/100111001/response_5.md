### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is designed to handle arithmetic or comparison operations between a DataFrame and a scalar or another DataFrame. The error is occurring when trying to multiply a DataFrame by a Series containing 'NaT' values of timedelta64 type. The error message indicates that the operation fails due to an unsupported operand type for multiplication between a numpy.ndarray and 'NaTType'.

The buggy function selects a specific operation based on the type of the `right` input but encounters issues when dealing with 'NaT' values in this context. In the failing test, the DataFrame `df` is being multiplied by a Series `ser` containing 'NaT' entries, triggering the bug.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to update the handling of operations involving 'NaT' values. Specifically, when performing arithmetic operations between a DataFrame and a Series containing 'NaT' values, we should handle these cases gracefully to avoid the TypeError caused by unsupported operand types.

### Corrected Function
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if not pd.isna(b.iloc[i]) else np.nan for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isna(b) else np.nan for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

### Correction Rationale
I updated the `column_op` functions for the cases where the `right` input is a Series containing 'NaT' values. In these cases, I added checks to handle 'NaT' entries by replacing them with `np.nan` in the resulting DataFrame. This modification ensures that the operation can proceed without triggering a TypeError due to unsupported operand types involving 'NaT' values.

By making these adjustments, the corrected function should now handle operations involving 'NaT' values appropriately and resolve the issue encountered in the failing test.
