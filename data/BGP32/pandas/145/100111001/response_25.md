### Analysis:
- The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is designed to evaluate frame operations by going column-by-column and dispatching to the Series implementation.
- The failing test `test_td64_op_nat_casting` involves multiplying a DataFrame `df` by a Series `ser` containing NaT values with dtype `timedelta64[ns]`.
- The error occurs when trying to evaluate the operation using `expressions.evaluate` which leads to `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'`.
- The issue seems to be related to handling NaT values during the operation, resulting in an unsupported operand type error.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because in the case where the right operand is a Series with NaT values, the function fails to handle the operation correctly, leading to the TypeError.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `column_op` function to handle the case when the right operand is a Series with NaT values. We should account for the NaT values during the operation to avoid the unsupported operand type error.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns)}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns)}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns)}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if not isna(b.iloc[i]) else b.iloc[i] for i in range(len(a.columns)}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

By modifying the `column_op` function to handle the case where the right operand is a Series with NaT values, the corrected version should now handle the operation correctly and pass the failing test.
