### Bug Identification
The bug occurs when trying to perform the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing `NaT` values. The error happens when the `evaluate` method is called inside the `dispatch_to_series` function.

### Bug Explanation
1. The test case creates a DataFrame `df` with values `[1, 2]` and `[3, 4]` and a Series `ser` with values `NaT` and `NaT.`
2. When trying to perform `df * ser`, the `dispatch_to_series` function is called to handle the operation.
3. The function attempts to evaluate the operation column-by-column between the DataFrame and the Series. However, when it encounters a `NaT` value in the Series, it causes an error because `NaT` is not a valid operand for multiplication.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `NaT` values are present in the Series. Since arithmetic operations with `NaT` will not work, we can replace `NaT` values with `np.nan` before performing the operation.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    right = right.where(pd.notnull(right), np.nan)  # Replace NaT with np.nan

    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    
    return new_data
``` 

By replacing `NaT` values with `np.nan`, we prevent the TypeError caused by trying to perform arithmetic operations with invalid operands. This correction should address the bug and allow the test case to pass successfully.
