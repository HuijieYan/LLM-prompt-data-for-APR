### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object, which is intended to avoid reference cycles. Then it passes this weak reference to `self._engine_type` along with the length of `self`.

### Identifying the Issue
1. The usage of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference appears to be incorrect as it is not being utilized properly.
2. The return statement is passing the weak reference `period` to `self._engine_type` along with the length of `self`, which might not be the intended behavior.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference, leading to unexpected behavior when `period` is passed to `self._engine_type`.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the usage of `weakref.ref(self)` and how the weak reference is passed to `self._engine_type`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass self directly to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
``` 

In the corrected version, we are passing `self` directly to `_engine_type`, which should maintain the intended behavior while avoiding reference cycles.
