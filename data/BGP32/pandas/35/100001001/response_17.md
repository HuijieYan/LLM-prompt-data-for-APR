### Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided function `_engine` is that it incorrectly uses `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This operation does not create a weak reference to `self` but rather creates a weak callable object that returns `self` when called. This leads to a reference cycle not being broken as intended, causing potential memory leaks.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to correctly create a weak reference to `self` using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`. This will properly break the reference cycle and avoid potential memory leaks.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
