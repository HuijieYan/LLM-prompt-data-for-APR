### Explanation
The bug in the `_engine` function is that it is attempting to create a weak reference to the `self` object but is not correctly dereferencing it when passing it to `_engine_type`. This results in a circular reference and potentially a memory leak.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to correctly dereference the weak reference object before passing it to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

In the corrected version, we call `period()` to dereference the weak reference object before passing it to `_engine_type`. This ensures that there are no circular references and potential memory leaks.
