### Analysis
- The function `_engine` is using a cache decorator (`@cache_readonly`) to memoize the result of the `_engine_type` method.
- The function takes a `self` parameter, representing a `PeriodIndex` object, and a `value` parameter, which is not used within the function.
- The function creates a weak reference to `self` using `weakref.ref` and passes it to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`.

### Error Location
The potential error in the function lies in the creation of the weak reference to `self` using `weakref.ref(self)`.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the function is that `weakref.ref` does not return the object but a weak reference proxy, which needs to be dereferenced to access the original object. Therefore, when the weak reference `period` is passed to `_engine_type`, it is actually passing the proxy weak reference instead of the original `self` object.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to dereference the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`. This can be achieved by calling the weak reference object to retrieve the original object.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
