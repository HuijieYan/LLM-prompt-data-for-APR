### Analysis
The `_engine` function is a cache_readonly method that is intended to return the engine type associated with the PeriodIndex object. The function uses weakref to create a weak reference to the PeriodIndex object to prevent reference cycles.

### Issues
1. The weak reference is not used correctly, as it should be passed to `_engine_type`, but instead, it is returned as a weak reference object directly.
2. The `_engine_type` is called with incorrect arguments, as it should take the weak reference and the length of the PeriodIndex object.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of weakref and the incorrect arguments passed to `_engine_type`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Create a weak reference to the PeriodIndex object correctly.
2. Pass the weak reference and the length of the PeriodIndex object to the `_engine_type` constructor.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Pass the weak reference and the length of self to _engine_type
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By making these changes, the function should now correctly pass the weak reference object and the length of the PeriodIndex object to the `_engine_type` constructor, fixing the bug.
