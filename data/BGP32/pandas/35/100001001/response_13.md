### Explanation of the bug
The bug in the `_engine` function is that it is creating a weak reference to `self` using `weakref.ref(self)` but not properly extracting the object referenced by the weak reference to pass it to `_engine_type`. This results in passing the weak reference `period` instead of the referenced object `self` to `_engine_type`, which causes the subsequent code to fail.

### Bug location
The bug is in the line `period = weakref.ref(self)`, where a weak reference to `self` is created but not used correctly.

### Fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to extract the object referenced by the weak reference `period` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This can be done by calling `period()` to retrieve the object. 

### Corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

By making this change, we correctly retrieve the object referenced by the weak reference `period` before passing it to `_engine_type`, fixing the bug in the function.
