### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is supposed to return an instance of the `_engine_type` class using a weak reference to the `self` object. However, the implementation of creating a weak reference using `weakref.ref(self)` is incorrect since it returns a weak reference object, not the actual object itself.

### Potential Error
1. Incorrect handling of weak reference creation.
2. `period` variable being a weak reference object instead of the actual object.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the function is returning a weak reference object instead of the actual object required by `_engine_type`, causing issues with subsequent operations expecting the actual object.

### Fix Strategy
Modify the function so that it retrieves the actual object from the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
