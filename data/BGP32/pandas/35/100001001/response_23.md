### Explanation
The bug in the `_engine` function is due to the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref`, which is causing the weak reference to be created incorrectly. Instead of passing a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`, a weak reference to `self` should be stored in a variable, and that weak reference should be passed to `_engine_type`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Create a weak reference to `self` and store it in a variable.
2. Pass the weak reference variable to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self` as the arguments.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self
    weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weak_period, len(self))
```
