### Case 1
#### Runtime values and types of the input parameters of the buggy function
`self`: `PeriodIndex(['2019Q1', '2019Q2'], dtype='period[Q-DEC]', freq='Q-DEC')`, type: `PeriodIndex`

#### Values and types of relevant variables at the function's return
- `period`: `<weakref at 0x7f8e232e0f90; to 'PeriodIndex' at 0x7f8e232db350>`

### Explanation
The bug in the function is that it incorrectly sets the `period` variable as a weak reference to `self` without actually creating a weak reference to `self`. This leads to a reference cycle problem as mentioned in the comment, potentially causing memory leaks.

### Suggested Fix
To fix this bug, the correct way to create a weak reference to `self` is to use `weakref.ref(self)` directly rather than assigning it to the `period` variable. 

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```
