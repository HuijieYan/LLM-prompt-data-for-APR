### Analysis
- The function `_engine` is supposed to return an instance of `_engine_type` by passing a weak reference of `self` to it.
- The usage of `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self` is correct.
- However, the error might be related to how the weak reference is passed to `_engine_type`.

### Error Location
- The potential error is in how the weak reference `period` is used while calling `_engine_type`.

### Bug Explanation
- The bug might be causing an issue in maintaining the weak reference to `self` while creating an instance of `_engine_type`. This can lead to a reference cycle, which could create memory leaks or affect the garbage collection process.

### Fix Strategy
- To fix the bug, you should properly use the weak reference `period` while calling `_engine_type` to ensure that the weak reference is maintained correctly.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

In the corrected version, `period()` is called to retrieve the weakly referenced object before passing it to `_engine_type`. This ensures that the weak reference is properly used and prevents any reference cycle issues.
