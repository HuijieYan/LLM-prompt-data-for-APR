### Explanation:
The buggy function `_engine` is intended to create an instance of the `_engine_type` class by passing a weak reference to the current `PeriodIndex` instance and its length. However, the implementation is incorrect because it assigns `weakref.ref(self)` to `period`, which only creates a weak reference to `self`, but it should instead create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance.

### Bug:
The bug in the function is that it is creating a weak reference to `self` instead of the `PeriodIndex` instance.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the function to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance instead of just `self`.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weak reference of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

In the corrected version, `weakref.ref(self)()` creates a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance instead of just `self`.
