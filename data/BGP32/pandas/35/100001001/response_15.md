### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type` but is not correctly creating the weak reference object. This is causing issues with reference cycle management.

### Error Location
The error is located in the line:
```python
period = weakref.ref(self)
```

### Cause of the Bug
The bug arises from the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference object. The `weakref.ref` function should be used to create a weak reference to an object, not directly assigned to a variable.

### Fix
To fix this bug, we need to properly create a weak reference object to `self`. We can do this by modifying the line as follows:
```python
period = weakref.ref(self)
```

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
