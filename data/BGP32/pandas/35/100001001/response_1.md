### Analysis
- The function `_engine` is supposed to return an engine type based on the input `self`.
- The use of `weakref.ref` suggests that the function is trying to avoid a reference cycle by creating a weak reference to `self`.
- The return statement creates an engine type using the weak reference to `self`.

### Issues
1. The function is creating a weak reference to `self`, but it is not utilizing this weak reference correctly when creating the engine type.
2. The engine type creation should use the weak reference object to avoid potential reference cycle issues.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by not correctly utilizing the weak reference object to `self` when creating the engine type. The function should utilize the weak reference object to prevent the creation of a reference cycle.

### Fix
Use the weak reference object (`period`) correctly when creating the engine type.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

In the corrected version, `period()` is called to return the original object from the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`.
