### Analysis
The function `_engine` is supposed to return an instance of the `_engine_type` class with the reference of `self` passed as a weak reference. However, the implementation using `weakref.ref(self)` is incorrect as it doesn't create a weak reference to `self` but rather a reference to `self`.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by using `weakref.ref(self)` incorrectly, which doesn't create a weak reference as intended.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to correctly create a weak reference to `self` using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
