### Explanation of the bug
The bug in the `_engine` function lies in the line `period = weakref.ref(self)`. This line is creating a weak reference to `self`, which means that the object may be garbage collected before the engine is created, leading to unexpected behavior. As a result, when `_engine_type` is called with `period` as an argument, `self` may have been deallocated.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that a strong reference to `self` is maintained until the engine is created. One way to achieve this is by storing `self` in a variable before creating a weak reference to it.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a strong reference to self
    self_strongref = self
    # Pass a weakref of self to _engine_type
    def create_engine():
        return self_strongref._engine_type(weakref.ref(self_strongref), len(self_strongref))
    
    return create_engine()
``` 

In this corrected version, we maintain a strong reference to `self` using `self_strongref`, and then pass a weak reference to `self` to `_engine_type`. This ensures that `self` is not deallocated before the engine is created.
