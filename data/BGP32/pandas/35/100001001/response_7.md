### Explanation of the bug

The bug in the `_engine` function lies in the line `period = weakref.ref(self)`. This line is creating a weak reference to `self`, but it is not storing the result in a variable or passing it to any other function. This means that the weak reference created is essentially useless and does not serve any purpose in preventing a reference cycle.

### Bug fixing strategy

To fix this bug, we need to properly use the weak reference created to avoid reference cycles. We should pass this weak reference to the `_engine_type` function to ensure we are actually breaking any potential reference cycles.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Pass a weakref of self to _engine_type to avoid a reference cycle.
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
``` 

By passing the weak reference to `_engine_type`, we ensure that reference cycles are correctly handled within the `_engine` function.
