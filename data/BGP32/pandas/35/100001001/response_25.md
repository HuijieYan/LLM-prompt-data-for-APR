### Analysis
The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`. However, this approach is not correct as `weakref.ref()` creates a weak reference object, and when the weak reference is resolved, it returns the original object. This means that when `period` is passed to `_engine_type`, it will resolve to the original `self` object, leading to a potential reference cycle issue.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by using `weakref.ref(self)` incorrectly to pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`, which might result in a reference cycle issue.

### Bug Fix
Instead of creating a weak reference object, directly pass `self` to `_engine_type` to avoid potential reference cycle issues.

### Corrected Version

def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
