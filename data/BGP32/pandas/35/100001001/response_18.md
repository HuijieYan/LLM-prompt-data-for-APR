### Analysis
- The function `_engine` is a cache_readonly decorator, indicating that its result should be cached for subsequent calls.
- The function is using weakref to avoid a reference cycle when passing `self` to `_engine_type`.
- The function should return the result of calling `_engine_type` with `period` (which is a weak reference to `self`) and the length of `self` (which is a PeriodIndex).

### Bug
The bug in the function is the incorrect usage of `weakref` to create a weak reference to `self`. The weak reference should be created using `weakref.ref(self)` instead of attempting to pass `self` directly to `_engine_type`.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to correctly create a weak reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
