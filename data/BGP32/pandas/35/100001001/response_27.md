### Analysis
The `_engine` function is trying to create an engine type using a weak reference to the `self` object. However, it is not generating the engine correctly based on the input `PeriodIndex` object.

### Bug
The bug lies in the way the weak reference `period` is being created with `weakref.ref(self)`, as it is not being used correctly to create the engine type.

### Fix
To fix the bug, the weak reference needs to be accessed correctly to refer to the actual object. By modifying how the weak reference is used in creating the engine type, we can ensure that the engine is created correctly.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

In the corrected version, `period()` is used to access the actual object referred to by the weak reference, which ensures the correct engine type is created.
