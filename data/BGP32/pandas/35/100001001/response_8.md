### Explanation:
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` incorrectly. The intention seems to be creating a weak reference to avoid potential reference cycles, but `weakref.ref(self)` does not create a weak reference to the object itself. Instead, it creates a weak reference to the method `self`. This is likely the cause of the bug, as it does not achieve the intended purpose of avoiding reference cycles.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to create a weak reference to the `self` object, not to the method `self`. We can achieve this by using `weakref.ref(self)` in a different way.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref(), len(self))
``` 

In this corrected version, `weakref.ref(self)` is stored in `period_ref`, and the weak reference to the object itself is obtained by calling `period_ref()`. This should address the issue and correctly create a weak reference to the object.
