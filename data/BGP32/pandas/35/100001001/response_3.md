### Explanation of the bug
The bug in the `_engine` function lies in the usage of `weakref.ref()` on `self`. `weakref.ref()` creates a weak reference to the object rather than a strong reference, which leads to unexpected behavior when trying to access the object later. This can result in the `self` object being garbage collected prematurely or not being accessible when needed.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that a strong reference to `self` is passed to `_engine_type` rather than a weak reference. This will prevent premature garbage collection and ensure the object is accessible when needed.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
``` 

By directly passing `self` to `_engine_type`, we are ensuring a strong reference to the object is used, preventing any premature garbage collection issues.
