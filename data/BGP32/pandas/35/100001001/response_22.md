### Case 1
#### Runtime values and types of the input parameters of the buggy function
self, value: `PeriodIndex(['2019Q1', '2019Q2'], dtype='period[Q-DEC]', freq='Q-DEC')`, type: `PeriodIndex`

#### Relevant variable values and types at the function's return
- period: `<weakref at 0x7f9007b057c0; to 'PeriodIndex' at 0x7f9007b11700>`

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_engine` function is that it is creating a weak reference to `self` without actually accessing the referenced object. This means that the weak reference does not serve its purpose of breaking a potential reference cycle properly.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to actually access the object referenced by the weak reference `period` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This ensures that the weak reference captures the object correctly and avoids the reference cycle.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Accessing the object referenced by the weak reference
    period = weakref ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
