### Explanation
The bug in the `_engine` function lies in the way the `weakref.ref()` is used to create a weak reference to `self`. In the buggy implementation, `period = weakref.ref(self)` does not create a weak reference to the `self` object. Instead, it creates a weak reference to the `_weakref` object itself.

### Potential Error Location
1. Incorrect usage of `weakref.ref(self)`

### Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is that `weakref.ref(self)` is creating a weak reference to the `_weakref` object itself, not to the `self` object. This means that the intended weak reference to the `self` object is not actually being formed, leading to potential memory leaks or reference cycle issues.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly create a weak reference to the `self` object in the `_engine` function. This can be done by modifying the way weak references are created.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we create a weak reference to the `self` object as intended. This change should resolve the bug in the `_engine` function.
