### Analysis and Explanation
In the provided buggy function `_engine`, there seems to be an issue with how the `period` variable is being assigned. It is using `weakref.ref(self)` which attempts to create a weak reference to `self`, but it is not handling the reference properly in the return call to `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.

The usage of `weakref.ref(self)` should be handled differently to ensure that the weak reference does not get garbage collected prematurely.


### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to properly handle the weak reference creation and ensure that it stays alive throughout the `_engine` function call. One way to do this is by storing the weak reference in a local variable within the `_engine` function.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
``` 

In this corrected version, we store the weak reference `period_ref` in a local variable and then pass it to `self._engine_type` to prevent premature garbage collection.
