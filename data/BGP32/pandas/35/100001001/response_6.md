### Case 1
#### Runtime values and types of the input parameters of the buggy function
self, value: `PeriodIndex(['2019Q1', '2019Q2'], dtype='period[Q-DEC]', freq='Q-DEC')`, type: `PeriodIndex`

#### Values and types of relevant variables at return
period: `<weakref at 0x7f920563b570; to 'PeriodIndex' at 0x7f920559abe0>`

### Explanation of the bug
The bug in the `_engine` function lies in how the weak reference to `self` is being assigned to the `period` variable. Currently, `period = weakref.ref(self)` is creating a weak reference to `self` but not correctly dereferencing it when calling `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. This leads to incorrect behavior when trying to create the engine with a weak reference instead of the actual object.

### Fix strategy
To fix this bug, we need to correctly dereference the weak reference `period` before passing it to `self._engine_type`. We can achieve this by calling `period()` to get the actual object the weak reference is pointing to.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type
    # Dereference the weak reference to get the actual object
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
