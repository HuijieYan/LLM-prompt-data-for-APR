### Analysis
The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to the `self` object (an instance of `PeriodIndex`) and pass it to `_engine_type` along with the length of the `PeriodIndex`. However, the usage of `weakref.ref` seems to be incorrect in this context and might be causing the bug.

### Bug Explanation
The bug might be caused by using `weakref.ref` inappropriately. The purpose of `weakref.ref` is to create weak references to objects to avoid reference cycles and enable objects to be garbage collected when not in use. In this case, creating a weak reference to `self` and passing it to `_engine_type` may not be necessary and could result in unexpected behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
Since creating a weak reference to `self` might not be needed in this context, we can directly pass `self` to `_engine_type` while keeping the length of the `PeriodIndex`. By removing the use of `weakref.ref`, we can potentially fix the bug and simplify the function.
