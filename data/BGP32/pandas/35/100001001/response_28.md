### Case 1 Analysis
- `self`: `PeriodIndex(['2019Q1', '2019Q2'], dtype='period[Q-DEC]', freq='Q-DEC')`, type: `PeriodIndex`
- `value`: Not directly used in the buggy function.

### Error Location
The error is likely occurring in the line `period = weakref.ref(self)`. In this line, `self` is used to create a weak reference, but it is not being stored anywhere, making it ineffective.

### Bug Explanation
The bug is caused by creating a weak reference to `self` without actually storing it in a variable. Consequently, when `_engine_type` is called with `period` as an argument, it doesn't contain a valid weak reference to `self`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the weak reference created from `self` needs to be stored in a variable so that the reference is maintained throughout the function's execution.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_weakref, len(self))
```
