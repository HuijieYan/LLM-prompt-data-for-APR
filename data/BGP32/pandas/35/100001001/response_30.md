### Analysis
The `_engine` function is a `cache_readonly` function that is supposed to return the `_engine_type` instance for the current object. The bug seems to be related to how the `weakref.ref` object is created for the `self` object.

### Issues
1. The `weakref.ref(self)` call does not correctly create a weak reference to the `self` object. 
2. The `self._engine_type` call might not be functioning as expected due to the incorrect weak reference.

### Bug Cause
The bug likely arises from the incorrect creation of the weak reference for the `self` object, which is causing the subsequent operations to fail when interacting with the `self` object.

### Fix Strategy
1. To fix the bug, we need to correctly create a weak reference to the `self` object for the `_engine_type` call.
2. We should ensure that the weak reference maintains the reference for the duration of the function call.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Correctly create a weak reference to self.
    weak_self = weakref.ref(self)
    # Call _engine_type with the weak reference.
    return self._engine_type(weak_self, len(self))
```
