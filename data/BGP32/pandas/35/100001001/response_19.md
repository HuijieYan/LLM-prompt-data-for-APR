The bug in the `_engine` function is related to the use of `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`. The function is intended to return an instance of `_engine_type` with the weak reference and the length of `self`, but it seems the implementation is incorrect.

The use of `weakref.ref(self)` creates a weak reference object but does not return the original object. Therefore, when `_engine_type` is called with `period` and the length of `self`, it is actually operating on the weak reference object and not the original `self`.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `_engine` function to properly extract the original object from the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`. Here is the corrected version:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we ensure that the original object is passed to `_engine_type` and the weak reference doesn't interfere with the intended functionality.
