The buggy function `_engine` is trying to create a weak reference to the `self` object and then instantiate an `_engine_type` object using that weak reference. However, the bug occurs because it seems that `_engine_type` is not being properly instantiated, leading to an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` when trying to access an attribute on the `_engine` object.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine_type` is properly instantiated with the weak reference to `self`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In this corrected version, we call `period()` to get the actual object (not just the weak reference) before passing it to `_engine_type`. This should ensure that `_engine_type` receives the proper object and does not result in a `NoneType` object. This fix should address the issue and make the failing test pass as expected.
