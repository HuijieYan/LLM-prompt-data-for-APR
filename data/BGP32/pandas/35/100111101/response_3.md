The bug in the `_engine` function arises from the fact that the `period` variable is assigned to the result of `weakref.ref(self)`, which returns a weak reference object instead of the actual reference to `self`. This leads to the AttributeError when trying to access attributes of the weak reference object.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `_engine` function to return the reference to `self` directly without using `weakref`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By returning `self` directly, the function will provide a reference to the actual `self` object, avoiding the weak reference issue.

This correction should resolve the AttributeError and make the failing test pass as expected.
