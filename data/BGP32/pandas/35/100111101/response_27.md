The bug in the `_engine` function likely stems from the fact that `self._engine_type` is returning a `NoneType` object instead of the expected `PeriodEngine` object, leading to the AttributeError when trying to access the 'view' attribute.

To fix this bug, we should ensure that the `_engine_type` function returns a valid `PeriodEngine` object. This can be achieved by updating the `_engine_type` method or handling the possibility of a `NoneType` return when calling it.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type returned None, expected PeriodEngine")
    return engine
```

By adding a check to ensure that the returned `engine` is not `None`, we prevent the AttributeError from occurring.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
