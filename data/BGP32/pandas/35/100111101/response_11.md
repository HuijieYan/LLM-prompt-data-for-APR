The issue in the `_engine` function arises from the fact that `self._engine_type` is expecting the `period` argument to be a reference to the `PeriodIndex` object but instead is receiving a `weakref` reference. This causes an attribute error when trying to access the `view` method on the `NoneType` object.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that `period` is correctly passed as a reference to the `PeriodIndex` object when calling `self._engine_type`. Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By directly passing `self` rather than a weak reference to `self`, we address the bug and ensure that the engine receives the correct reference.

With this correction, the function should now behave as expected and pass the failing test.
