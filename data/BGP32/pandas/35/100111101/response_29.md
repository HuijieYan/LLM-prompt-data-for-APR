The bug in the `_engine` function arises from an issue with how the `period` reference is being created. The weak reference created using `weakref.ref(self)` is not being correctly utilized when passed to `_engine_type`. This results in an 'AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'' when trying to access attributes of the weak reference.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is properly utilized in the `_engine` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By invoking `weakref.ref(self)` and immediately calling it with `()`, we retrieve the weakly-referenced object itself. This corrected version should resolve the AttributeError issue reported in the failing test.
