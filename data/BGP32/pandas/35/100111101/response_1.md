The bug in the `_engine` function is due to the `period` weak reference being incorrectly implemented. This leads to the `PeriodEngine` instance not being properly set, causing the attribute error during the test execution.

Here's a strategy to fix the bug:

1. Instead of creating a weak reference to `self`, pass `self` directly when creating the `PeriodEngine` instance.
2. Ensure that the `PeriodEngine` instance is properly set up to avoid the attribute error.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))  # Pass self directly to PeriodEngine
```

This fix should address the issue and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
