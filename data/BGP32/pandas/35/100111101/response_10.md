### Bugs Analysis:
1. The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` incorrectly. It should be `weakref.ref(self)` without parentheses.
2. The error message indicates an AttributeError `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, which suggests that the `_engine_type` function is returning `None`, leading to the subsequent error.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Remove the parentheses after `self` in `weakref.ref(self)` to correctly create a weak reference.
2. Ensure that the `_engine_type` function returns a valid object and does not return `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is not None:
        return engine
    raise ValueError("_engine_type cannot return None.")
``` 

By making the above correction, the `NoneType` error will be handled, and the corrected function should now pass the failing test.
