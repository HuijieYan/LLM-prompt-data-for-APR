### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when trying to access the `_engine` attribute, which is expected to be an instance of `PeriodEngine`, but due to the weak reference implementation, it is returning a `NoneType` instead, leading to the `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference implementation returns the correct instance of `PeriodEngine` instead of `None`. One way to achieve this is by modifying the creation of the weak reference and ensuring that the instance referenced is correctly stored.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the correct file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version of _engine
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a strong reference to self to prevent it from being garbage collected
    self._weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._weak_period, len(self))

```

By storing a strong reference to `self`, we prevent it from being garbage collected prematurely, which ensures that the `self._engine_type(self._weak_period, len(self))` call successfully retrieves the correct instance of `PeriodEngine`, resolving the bug.
