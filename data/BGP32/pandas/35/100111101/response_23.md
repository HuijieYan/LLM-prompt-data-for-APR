### Bug Explanation
The error message `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` suggests that the `PeriodEngine` object is somehow becoming `None` leading to this attribute error. This can happen if the weak reference is not properly maintained and the object gets garbage collected before being accessed in the function.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference of `self` is properly maintained throughout the function's execution. We can achieve this by storing the weak reference in a class attribute or a local variable to prevent it from being garbage collected prematurely.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, store a weakref of self in a local variable.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference in a local variable `period_ref`, we prevent premature garbage collection of the object referenced by `self`, and the function should now work correctly without raising any `NoneType` attribute errors.
