### Analysis
1. The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to pass a weak reference of the `self` object to `_engine_type`.
2. The error occurs when trying to access the view of `super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter()`, where the return value is `NoneType`.
3. This AttributeError happens when the engine type reference is lost or incorrectly initialized, leading to a `NoneType` object.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the engine type reference is correctly initialized and accessible.

### Correction
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Ensure a strong reference to self
    period = self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By updating the `_engine` function to use a strong reference to `self`, we prevent the weak reference issue that caused the AttributeError. This correction should resolve the problem and allow the failing test to pass.
