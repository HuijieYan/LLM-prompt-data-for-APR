The bug in the `_engine` function is related to the return statement that uses `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. The issue arises from how `period` is defined using `weakref.ref(self)`. This causes problems when accessing attributes or methods of `period` later on.

To fix this bug, we should modify how `period` is defined and accessed within the function. Instead of using weak references, we can directly pass `self` to `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By making this change, we ensure that the function `self._engine_type` receives a direct reference to `self`, which should resolve the AttributeError issue related to 'NoneType' object in the failing test case.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test case.
