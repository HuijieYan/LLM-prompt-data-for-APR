Upon analyzing the provided code and error message, it appears that the bug lies in the `_engine` function in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file. The function is trying to return a value from `_engine_type` but is encountering an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`. This error arises when the function is trying to access a method or attribute on a `NoneType` object.

The issue seems to be related to the `period` variable which is assigned as a weak reference to `self`. Weak references allow the referenced object to be garbage collected if there are no strong references. In this case, since `period` is a weak reference, it may become `None` at some point, leading to the `NoneType` error.

To fix this bug, we should avoid using weak references in this context as it seems unnecessary. Instead, directly pass `self` to `_engine_type`. This will maintain a strong reference to the object and prevent it from being garbage collected prematurely.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By directly passing `self` to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the object remains valid throughout the function's execution.

This correction should resolve the `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` issue observed in the failing test.
