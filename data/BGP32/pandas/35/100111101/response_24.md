The bug in the `_engine` function arises from the fact that `self._engine_type` is expecting a reference to `self` but instead receives a weak reference which causes an AttributeError when trying to access 'view' attribute on a NoneType object.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to pass a reference to `self` instead of a weak reference.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By returning `self` instead of a weak reference to `self`, we ensure that the engine receives the proper reference and can access its attributes correctly. This correction should resolve the AttributeError seen in the failing test and make it pass successfully.
