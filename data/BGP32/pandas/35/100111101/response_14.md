The bug in the `_engine` function is related to the weak reference creation of the `period` variable. The issue arises from the way `weakref.ref` is used to create the weak reference. 

The `weakref.ref()` function returns a weak reference object pointing to the original object (in this case, `self`), but the `period` variable is not used correctly in the function. When `weakref.ref(self)` is assigned to `period`, it retains a weak reference and does not dereference to the original object automatically. Hence, while invoking `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, it is still passing a weak reference object instead of the original object.

To fix this bug, we need to dereference the weak reference object `period` before passing it to the `_engine` method.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Dereference the weak reference to obtain the original object
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By dereferencing `period` using `weakref.ref(self)()`, we obtain the original object that `self` references. This correction ensures that the original object is passed to the `_engine_type` method.

After applying this fix, the `_engine` function should now correctly pass the original object to the `_engine_type` method, resolving the issue reported in the failing test.
