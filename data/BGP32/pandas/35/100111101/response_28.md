The bug in the `_engine` function is causing an `AttributeError` due to returning a `NoneType` object that does not have the attribute `view`. This error is triggered by the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` in the file `test_get_level_values.py`, leading to the assertion failure.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine` function returns a valid object instead of a `NoneType`. We can modify the function to properly instantiate the `PeriodEngine` object and return it.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if self._engine_type else None
```

This modification ensures that if `self._engine_type` is not None, then the `PeriodEngine` object is properly instantiated and returned. This change should resolve the `AttributeError` that was occurring.

Please test the corrected version to confirm that it fixes the issue with the failing test.
