The bug in the `_engine` function is due to the fact that `weakref.ref(self)` is being assigned to `period` which is causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a weak reference instead of a strong reference to `self`. This leads to the AttributeError when trying to access methods of `self`.

To fix this bug, the `weakref.ref(self)` should be changed to just `self` so that a strong reference is passed to `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By making this change, the `_engine` function should now correctly pass a strong reference to `_engine_type` and resolve the AttributeError issue observed in the failing test.
