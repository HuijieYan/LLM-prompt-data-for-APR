### Bug Explanation
The error message indicates that there is an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` being raised. This suggests that a variable that is supposed to have a `view` method is actually `None`. Looking at the provided buggy function `_engine`, we can see that `period` is being set as a weak reference of `self`, but it is not being passed correctly when creating the engine. This causes the `self._engine_type` method to not receive the `period` weak reference as expected, leading to the error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to correctly pass the weak reference of `self` when creating the engine. This involves making sure that the `period` variable is correctly passed to the `_engine_type` method.

### The corrected version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference `period` is dereferenced by calling `period()` before being passed to the `_engine_type` method. This ensures that the engine receives the actual `self` object instead of a weak reference. This correction should address the `NoneType` error and make the function work correctly with the provided test.
