### Fixing the Bug

#### Issue:
The error message indicates that the `_engine` attribute of the `PeriodIndex` instance is returning `None`, leading to the `AttributeError`. This suggests that the `_engine_type` method is not creating the engine object correctly, resulting in it being `None`.

#### Solution:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine_type` method correctly creates the engine object and returns a valid reference to it. It seems that the weak reference usage is causing the issue. We will modify the `_engine` method to handle the weak reference correctly and avoid the situation where the engine object becomes `None`.

#### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weak_period, len(self))
```

By modifying the `_engine` function to correctly create and return the engine object using the weak reference `weak_period`, we ensure that the engine object is not becoming `None`, fixing the bug that caused the failing test.
