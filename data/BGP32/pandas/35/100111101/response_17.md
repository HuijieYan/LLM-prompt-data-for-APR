The bug in the `_engine` function is due to the fact that `self._engine_type` is receiving a weak reference to `self`, but it seems that it is not being properly handled in the `_engine_type` function. This results in an `AttributeError` when trying to access an attribute of a `NoneType`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is being correctly handled in the `_engine_type` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine_type if engine_type is not None else self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this fix, the function now checks if the result returned by `self._engine_type` is `None` and if so, it will call the function again to ensure that a valid engine is returned. This should resolve the `AttributeError` issue seen in the failing test.

After applying this correction, the `_engine` function should now work as expected and pass the failing test.
