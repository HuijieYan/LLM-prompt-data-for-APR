The cause of the bug in the provided function `_engine` is that the weak reference created with `weakref.ref(self)` is not properly used when calling `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. This leads to an error where the `_engine` object is not correctly referenced, resulting in the `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` during the failing test execution.

To fix this bug, the weak reference object should be properly dereferenced using `period()` before passing it to `self._engine_type`. This will ensure that the weak reference is correctly pointing to the `self` object.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By dereferencing the weak reference with `period()`, we can ensure that the correct object is being passed to `_engine_type`, fixing the bug and enabling the test to pass successfully.
