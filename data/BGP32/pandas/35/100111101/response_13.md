The bug in the `_engine` function is due to the fact that `self._engine_type` is trying to access the `view` attribute of a `NoneType` object, resulting in an `AttributeError`. This is likely caused by an improper initialization of `self._engine_type`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `self._engine_type` is properly initialized before accessing its attributes.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    if hasattr(self, '_engine_type'):
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        return None
```

By checking if `self._engine_type` exists before accessing its attributes, we prevent the `AttributeError` from occurring.

This correction should address the issue and make the test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` pass.
