The bug in the `_engine` function is caused by returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` without properly initializing `self._engine_type`. This leads to an `AttributeError` on the line `return super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter().view("i8")`.

To fix the bug, we need to properly initialize the `self._engine_type` attribute before returning it in the `_engine` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    if not hasattr(self, '_engine_type'):
        self._engine_type = PeriodEngine
    
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This corrected version ensures that `self._engine_type` is properly initialized before being returned, fixing the `AttributeError` issue.
