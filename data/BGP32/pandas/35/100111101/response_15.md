The bug in the `_engine` function is that `self._engine_type` is called with a `weakref` object `period` rather than the actual `self`. This results in an AttributeError when trying to access an attribute on the `period` object.

To fix this bug, we need to pass the `self` object instead of the `weakref` object to `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# Fixing the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By making this change, the `self` object will be directly passed to `_engine_type`, ensuring that the expected attributes can be accessed without any `NoneType` error.

After applying this correction, the `test_get_level_values_when_periods` test should pass without encountering the AttributeError.
