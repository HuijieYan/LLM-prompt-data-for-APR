The bug in the `_engine` function arises from the fact that the `weakref.ref` method is not being correctly utilized to create a weak reference to `self`, leading to an incorrect reference cycle. This results in an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute on a `NoneType` object.

To fix this bug, we need to correctly create a weak reference to `self` using the `weakref.ref` method. Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` instead of just `period`, we retrieve the actual object that the weak reference points to. This should resolve the reference cycle issue and prevent the `AttributeError` from occurring.

With this correction, the function should now correctly create the `_engine` object without causing any attribute errors, and the failing test should pass as expected.
