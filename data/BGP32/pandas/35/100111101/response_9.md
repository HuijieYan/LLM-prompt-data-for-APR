### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_engine` function arises from the fact that the `weakref.ref(self)` returns a weak reference to `self`, which might lead to the `self` being garbage collected before `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` is executed. This can result in `self` being `None` when trying to access attributes or methods of `self`, leading to the 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view' error.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `self` is accessible throughout the `_engine` function. One way to achieve this is by storing a strong reference to `self` before creating the weak reference, so that `self` is not prematurely garbage collected.

### Corrected Version of the `_engine` Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a strong reference to self
    period = self
    # Create a weak reference to avoid reference cycles
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_weakref, len(period))
```

With this fix, we ensure that `self` is not garbage collected before `_engine_type` is called, avoiding the 'NoneType' object attribute error. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
