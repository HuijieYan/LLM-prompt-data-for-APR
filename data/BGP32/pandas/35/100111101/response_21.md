### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` incorrectly. It is passing `self` to `weakref.ref`, which is creating a weak reference to `self`. This results in `_engine_type` receiving a weak reference instead of the intended object, leading to an `AttributeError` when trying to access an attribute that does not exist on a weak reference.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref(self)` in the `_engine` function. Instead of passing `self` directly to `_engine_type`, it passes a weak reference, causing the `AttributeError` when trying to access an attribute on the weak reference object.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to change how the weak reference is created. Instead of passing the weak reference to `_engine_type`, we should pass the actual object. This can be achieved by calling `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By correcting the function as described above, it should now pass the failing test.
