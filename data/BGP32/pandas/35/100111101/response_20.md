Based on the error message and the runtime values provided, the bug seems to be related to the `PeriodEngine` class returning a `NoneType` object, which triggers an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine_type` function in the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class returns a valid instance of `PeriodEngine` instead of a `NoneType`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` method:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        engine = PeriodEngine(period, len(self))  # Create a new instance if _engine_type returns None
    return engine
```

By checking if the `_engine_type` returns `None`, we make sure that we always have a valid `PeriodEngine` instance to work with, preventing the `AttributeError` observed during the failing test.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and meet the expected input/output values.
