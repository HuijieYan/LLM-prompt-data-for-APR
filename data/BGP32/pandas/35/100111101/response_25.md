The issue in the provided `_engine` function is that it is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` without properly setting the `period` variable. This leads to an AttributeError when trying to access `view("i8") on a NoneType object. 

To fix this bug, we need to correctly set the `period` variable before passing it to `_engine_type`. We can achieve this by directly passing `self` to `_engine_type` without using `weakref`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

This correction should resolve the AttributeError issue and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
