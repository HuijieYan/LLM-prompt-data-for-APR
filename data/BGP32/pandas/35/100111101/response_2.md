The bug in the provided function `_engine` is due to the fact that `self._engine_type` is expecting a non-weak reference to `self`, but `period = weakref.ref(self)` creates a weak reference. This leads to an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` when trying to access an attribute of a weak reference.

To fix this bug, we need to pass a strong reference to `self` instead of a weak reference in `_engine`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By passing `self` directly to `_engine_type`, we ensure that a strong reference is used, resolving the issue with weak references causing the AttributeError.

Once this corrected version is implemented, the failing test should pass without any errors.
