### Analysis:
1. The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`, but it is not being used correctly while initializing `period`. This could lead to the weak reference being lost prematurely.
2. Since the problem is related to weak references being lost, it aligns with the GitHub issue where weakrefs are being lost causing unexpected behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not correctly handling the weak reference creation using `weakref.ref`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
Properly handle the weak reference creation and usage to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained throughout the function's execution.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

With this correction, we are now correctly creating a weak reference to `self` and using it when initializing `period` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This should fix the issue of weakrefs being lost prematurely.
