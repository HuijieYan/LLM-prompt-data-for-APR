## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine()` is defined with a decorator `@cache_readonly`, indicating that it is intended to compute and cache a value that should be read-only. The function is supposed to return an instance of the `_engine_type` class, passing a weak reference of `self` (the current object) and the length of `self` as parameters. However, the buggy implementation creates a weak reference object `period` pointing to `self` but does not actually use it when instantiating `_engine_type`.

The issue reported on GitHub suggests that weak references are not being handled correctly, leading to unexpected behavior when working with `PeriodIndex` on a `MultiIndex`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Properly use the weak reference object `period` when creating the `_engine_type` instance.
2. Ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained throughout the `_engine_type` instance's lifecycle to avoid losing the reference prematurely.

## The corrected function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected function, we utilize the weak reference `period` when instantiating `_engine_type` to ensure that the reference remains valid for the duration of the operation, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
