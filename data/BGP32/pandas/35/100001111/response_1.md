### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`, but the implementation is incorrect as it is not capturing the weak reference correctly. This leads to issues when accessing the weakly referenced `self` later on.

### Error Location:
The error lies in the line:  
```python
period = weakref.ref(self)
```
This line should be capturing a weak reference of `self`, but it is not encapsulated properly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to be dropped prematurely before it is intended to be used, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Correctly capture the weak reference of `self` using `weakref.ref`.
2. Pass the weakly captured reference to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Capture a weak reference of self correctly
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

By correcting the implementation to pass `period()` (the result of calling the weak reference) instead of just `period`, we ensure that the weak reference is properly maintained until it is used, resolving the issue described in the GitHub problem.
