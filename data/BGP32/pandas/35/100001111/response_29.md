The bug in the `_engine` function is due to the usage of `weakref.ref(self)` which creates a weak reference to `self` but does not hold a reference to prevent the object from being garbage collected. This results in the `period` variable pointing to a garbage collected object. To fix this bug, we need to keep a strong reference to `self` to prevent it from being garbage collected.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By passing `self` directly to `_engine_type`, we ensure that a strong reference to `self` is maintained, preventing it from being garbage collected prematurely.

This correction aligns with the expected behavior and resolves the issue reported on GitHub regarding losing weakrefs in MultiIndex when copying PeriodIndex levels.
