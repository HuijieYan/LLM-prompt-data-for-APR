Based on the runtime values and the expected values described, the issue in the `_engine` function arises from the incorrect handling of weak referencing to `self`. As per the GitHub issue "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs", the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped prematurely, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, we need to correctly maintain the weak reference to `self` to prevent it from being dropped prematurely. We can achieve this by modifying the weak referencing logic in the `_engine` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    
    def period_factory():
        return period_weakref()
    
    return self._engine_type(period_factory, len(self))
```

By capturing `self` in a factory function `period_factory` and passing this function as a weak reference to the `_engine_type` constructor, we ensure that the `PeriodIndex` instance is maintained until the `PeriodEngine` initialization is complete.

This correction should address the weak reference handling issue and provide the expected behavior for the `_engine` function as outlined in the GitHub issue.
