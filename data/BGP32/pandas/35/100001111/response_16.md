Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the provided runtime and expected values, the issue seems to stem from the weak reference usage within the `_engine` function. The function is intended to create a weak reference to the `self` object (PeriodIndex) to avoid reference cycles. However, the weak reference is not being stored correctly, resulting in the `_engine_type` function potentially receiving a `None` value instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this issue, the weak reference should be stored properly before passing it to the `_engine_type` function. Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference properly
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In this corrected version, the weak reference is called (`period()`) before being passed to the `_engine_type` function to ensure that the actual `PeriodIndex` object is accessed and not `None`.

By implementing this change, the function should now correctly create a weak reference to the `self` object and pass it along to the `_engine_type` function as expected, resolving the issue reported on GitHub related to losing weakrefs in MultiIndex levels.
