## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is supposed to return an instance of `_engine_type` initialized with a weak reference of `self` and the length of `self`. However, the issue seems to be related to the way the weak reference `period` is created and passed. The function is returning the result of `_engine_type(period, len(self))`, but the weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` seems incorrect.

## Bug Explanation
The bug arises from the incorrect creation and usage of the weak reference. When `period = weakref.ref(self)` is called, it doesn't actually create a weak reference to `self` but instead returns a weak reference object. This object then gets passed as an argument to `_engine_type`, which results in an issue where `None` is likely being passed instead of the intended reference, causing the tests to fail.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to directly use the weak reference of `self` when calling `_engine_type`. This can be achieved by creating the weak reference using `period = weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `period = weakref.ref(self)`.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use weak reference proxy to pass a weak reference of self to _engine_type
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By making this change, we ensure that a proper weak reference to `self` is passed to `_engine_type`, resolving the bug that was causing the tests to fail.
