## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object (PeriodIndex) in order to avoid a reference cycle. Then it attempts to create an instance of `_engine_type` using this weak reference and the length of the PeriodIndex. However, the bug seems to be related to the usage of `weakref.ref(self)` and how it is passed to `_engine_type`.

### Error Location
The issue lies in how `weakref.ref(self)` is being used to create a weak reference to `self`.

### Cause of the Bug
When `weakref.ref(self)` is called, it creates a weak reference object referencing `self`. This means that the `period` variable is actually an instance of a weak reference, not a direct reference to the `self` object. When `period` is passed to `_engine_type`, it passes a weak reference object instead of the actual `self` object, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `_engine_type` receives an actual reference to the `self` object instead of a weak reference object. We can achieve this by using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak proxy reference to `self`, which behaves like a direct reference while still avoiding a reference cycle.

## Bug-fixed Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weak proxy reference of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
