### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` incorrectly, which leads to losing the weak reference to `self` prematurely. This issue is related to the GitHub issue mentioned, where copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` loses weakrefs. The function is not correctly creating a weak reference to `self`, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None`.

### Error Location:
The issue lies in the way the weak reference to `self` is created using `weakref.ref`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The `weakref.ref(self)` call is being stored directly in the `period` variable, which is not how weak references are supposed to be utilized. This direct assignment doesn't maintain the weak reference to `self` but rather stores a direct reference.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to store the weak reference object itself, not its result in the period variable. We should directly pass `self` to `_engine_type` instead of storing it in a variable.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference to self correctly
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By making this change, we maintain the weak reference to `self` correctly, which resolves the issue of losing weakrefs when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`.
