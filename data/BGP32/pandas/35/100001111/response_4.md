Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug in the `_engine` function is due to the weak reference not being properly passed to `_engine_type`, causing it to receive `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the weak reference is correctly passed to `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In this corrected version, `period()` is used to retrieve the object referenced by the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`. This ensures that the `PeriodIndex` object is correctly passed and prevents the issue of receiving `None`.

By implementing this fix, the function should now correctly handle weak references within the `PeriodIndex` and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
