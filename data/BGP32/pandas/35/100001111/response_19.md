Based on the provided information and the analysis of the buggy function, here is the fixed version:

```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

Explanation:
1. The original buggy function was not correctly passing the weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`, resulting in a reference cycle issue.
2. The bug was causing loss of weakrefs and making the PeriodEngine receive `None` instead of the intended PeriodIndex.
3. By modifying the return statement to `return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))`, we are now calling the weak reference `period()` to obtain the actual `self` instead of passing the weak reference itself.
4. This modification ensures that the weak reference of `self` is correctly used in the `_engine_type` function, addressing the reference cycle issue.

This corrected version should resolve the bug and align with the expected input/output values and the issue reported on GitHub.
