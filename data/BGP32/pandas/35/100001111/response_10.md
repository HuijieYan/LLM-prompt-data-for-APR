The issue seems to stem from the way weak reference to the `self` object is being handled in the `_engine` function. In the provided buggy function, the weak reference is established correctly but not accessed properly when creating the `_engine_type`. This results in the weak reference getting lost prematurely.

To fix the bug, we need to properly access the weak reference when creating the `_engine_type` object, ensuring that it remains valid throughout the function. Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In this corrected version, `period()` is used instead of `period` to access the underlying `self` object from the weak reference. This will ensure that the weak reference does not get lost prematurely and is correctly passed to the `_engine_type`.

This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is not dropped before intended.
