## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is supposed to return an instance of `_engine_type` with a weak reference to the `self` parameter. However, the issue arises when the weak reference to the `self` parameter is not correctly handled, leading to unexpected behavior.

The expected values show that the `_engine` function should return an instance of `PeriodArray` constructed from the `self._values` attribute of the `self` parameter, along with the `self` parameter itself being a `PeriodIndex`.

The GitHub issue highlights the problem with weak references in `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`, where the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped prematurely, causing unexpected behavior.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `self` parameter is maintained correctly within the `_engine` function. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference to `self` in a variable that persists throughout the function's execution.

## Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```
