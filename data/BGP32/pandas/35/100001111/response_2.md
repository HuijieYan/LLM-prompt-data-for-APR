## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_engine` function is due to passing a `weakref` of `self` to `_engine_type` which can lead to the weak reference being dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a `None` instead of a valid `PeriodIndex`. This issue results in unexpected behavior and incorrect handling of weak references.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` remains valid throughout the function execution until it is no longer needed. This can be achieved by modifying how the weak reference is utilized or by handling weak references more appropriately to prevent premature dropping.

## Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Pass a weak reference to self without immediately invoking it
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Retrieve the weakly referenced object when needed
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By retaining the weak reference to `self` and retrieving the referenced object when needed in the `_engine` function, we address the issue of dropping the weak reference prematurely. This corrected version ensures that the PeriodEngine receives the valid `PeriodIndex` object as intended.
