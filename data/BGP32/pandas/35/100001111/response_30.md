## Analyzing the buggy function and GitHub issue

1. The buggy function `_engine` is a cache readonly decorator that is supposed to create an engine with weak reference to a given `self` object of type `PeriodIndex`.
2. The GitHub issue indicates that copying a `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` results in losing weakrefs, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

## Potential error locations
- The weak reference creation using `weakref.ref(self)` may not be working as intended.
- The referencing of `self` within the function could be causing the weak reference to be lost.

## Cause of the bug
The buggy `_engine` function may be incorrectly creating a weak reference to the `self` object, leading to the weak reference getting lost or not properly utilized. This could result in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex` due to a weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped prematurely.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly created and maintained within the `_engine` function.
2. Verify that the weak reference is successfully passed to the `PeriodEngine` constructor to prevent it from receiving `None`.
3. Address any issues related to weak reference handling to ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives the intended `PeriodIndex`.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Ensure period() is called to get the weakly referenced object
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

By correctly calling `period()` after creating the weak reference, the corrected function should provide the intended `PeriodIndex` object to the `PeriodEngine`, addressing the weakref-related bug.
