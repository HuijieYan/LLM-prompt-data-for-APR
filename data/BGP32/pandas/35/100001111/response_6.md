The bug in the provided function `_engine` is that it creates a weak reference to `self` using `weakref.ref(self)` but then does not properly dereference it when passing it to `_engine_type`. This results in `_engine_type` receiving a weak reference object instead of the actual `self` object, causing unexpected behavior.

**Cause of the bug**:
The bug occurs because the weak reference to `self` is not properly dereferenced before being passed to `_engine_type`. This means that `_engine_type` receives a weak reference object instead of the original `self` object, leading to unexpected behavior.

**Strategy for fixing the bug**:
To fix this bug, we need to properly dereference the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`. We can achieve this by calling the weak reference object to get the original `self` object before passing it to `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By calling `weakref.ref(self)()` we properly dereference the weak reference object and pass the original `self` object to `_engine_type`, fixing the bug.
