## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference of the `self` object (which is a `PeriodIndex`), but it is not being correctly passed to `_engine_type`. This causes the weak reference to be dropped prematurely, resulting in `None` being passed to `_engine_type` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

## Bug Cause
1. The weak reference created with `weakref.ref` is not being correctly utilized to maintain a reference to the `self` object (`PeriodIndex`).
2. When `_engine_type` is called with `period` (which is supposed to be a weak reference), it receives `None`, leading to the issue described in the GitHub problem.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `self` object is properly maintained. We should modify the way the weak reference is stored and used when passing it to `_engine_type`.

## Correction
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

With this correction, the function will correctly pass the `PeriodIndex` object referenced by the weak reference `period` to `_engine_type`, ensuring that the weak reference is maintained until needed. This should resolve the issue described in the GitHub problem statement.
