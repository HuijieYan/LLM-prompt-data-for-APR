## Analysis:
- The buggy function `_engine` is a cache readonly function that returns an instance of `_engine_type` class with weak references to the `self` variable.
- The issue described on GitHub involves weak references being dropped prematurely, resulting in `None` being passed to the `_engine_type` instance.

## Error:
The issue is caused by prematurely dropping the weak reference to the `self` variable before passing it to the `_engine_type`.

## Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `self` variable is maintained until it is passed to the `_engine_type` instance.

## Corrected code:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Maintain a weak reference to self until passing it to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self), weak=True)
```

This corrected version ensures that the weak reference to `self` is kept until it is passed to the `_engine_type`. This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and provide the expected behavior for the function.
