## Analysis:
The bug is related to weak references being incorrectly handled in the `_engine` function. It appears that the `period` variable is created using `weakref.ref(self)`, but it is not being used correctly when constructing the `_engine_type`.

The expected output values indicate that the `_engine` function should return the correct `self._values` and `self` as expected, which are not being handled properly in the buggy implementation.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of the weak reference object `period`. The `self` reference is being weakly referenced, but the reference is not being accessed properly when creating the `_engine_type` object. This leads to the `_engine` function not returning the expected values.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is accessed correctly when creating the `_engine_type` object. This involves dereferencing the weak reference properly to get the original `self` object.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self._values))
```

In the corrected version, the weak reference `period` is dereferenced by calling `period()` in the return statement to get the original `self` object. This ensures that the `self._values` and `self` are passed correctly to the `_engine_type`, resolving the bug.
