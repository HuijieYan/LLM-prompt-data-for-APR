## Fixing the bug

### Error location:
The bug in the `_engine` function lies in the way the weak reference is created. The `weakref.ref` function is incorrectly capturing `self`, leading to a reference cycle and eventual loss of the weak reference.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs due to the improper creation of the weak reference using `weakref.ref(self)`. This creates a reference cycle, which breaks the expected behavior of weak references and causes the `_engine` function to receive `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To resolve the issue, we need to ensure the weak reference is correctly established without creating a reference cycle. We can achieve this by using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By making this change, the correct weak reference without a reference cycle will be passed to `_engine_type`, preserving the intended behavior and addressing the bug reported on GitHub.
