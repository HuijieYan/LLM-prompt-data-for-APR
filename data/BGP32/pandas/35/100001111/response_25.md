### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is attempting to return an engine type based on the period index provided. The issue mentioned on GitHub indicates that weak references are being lost during the process, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Error Location
The main error seems to be in the line `period = weakref.ref(self)`. Creating a weak reference to `self` might not be sufficient for the subsequent engine type creation.

### Cause of the Bug
When creating a weak reference to `self`, the reference might not be maintained long enough for the engine type creation. This results in the engine type receiving `None` instead of the actual `PeriodIndex`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To address the issue and maintain the weak reference correctly, we need to ensure that the reference remains valid during the creation of the engine type.

### Corrected Version
Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

This modification directly passes `self` (the `PeriodIndex`) to the engine type creation without relying on creating a weak reference separately. This should preserve the necessary reference for proper engine type initialization.
