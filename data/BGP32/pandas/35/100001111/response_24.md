Based on the provided information, it seems that the issue is related to the weak referencing of the `PeriodIndex` being dropped prematurely, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until the `PeriodEngine` is properly initialized.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In this corrected version, `period()` is called at the moment of creating the `PeriodEngine` to retrieve the actual `self` object before passing it to the `_engine_type` constructor. This ensures that the weak reference does not get dropped prematurely.

Please replace the buggy function in the specified file with this corrected version to resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to losing weakrefs in copied `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`.
