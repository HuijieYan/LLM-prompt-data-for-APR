## Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference of `self`, which is a PeriodIndex object. The weak reference is then passed to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`. The purpose of using a weak reference here is to avoid creating a reference cycle.

## Potential error locations

1. The creation of the weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` might be causing the issue.
2. Passing `period` to `_engine_type` along with `len(self)` might not be handling the weak reference correctly.

## Explanation of the bug

Based on the GitHub issue titled "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs," the problem lies in the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped prematurely. This results in `_engine_type` receiving `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

The function is not handling the weak reference properly, leading to the loss of the `PeriodIndex` weak reference before it is intended to be used.

## Fixing the bug

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is handled correctly and is not dropped prematurely. One way to achieve this is to maintain the weak reference throughout the execution of `_engine` and pass the actual `PeriodIndex` object to `_engine_type` when needed. 

Below is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    
    # Pass the weak reference to _engine_type along with the actual PeriodIndex object
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self), self)
```

By passing both the weak reference `period_ref` and the actual `self` object to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the weak reference is maintained until it is explicitly used in `_engine_type`.

This fix addresses the premature dropping of the weak reference, resolving the issue described in the GitHub post.
