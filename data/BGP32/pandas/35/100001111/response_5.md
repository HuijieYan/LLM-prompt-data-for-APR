## Explanation:
The bug in the `_engine` function occurs because when creating a weak reference to `self`, the reference is not stored in a way that preserves it throughout the function's execution. As a result, when `self` is used in the `_engine_type` call, it may have already been garbage collected, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly maintained throughout the execution of the `_engine` function, preventing premature garbage collection.

## The corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))  # Use `()` to retrieve the object from the weak reference.
```

In the corrected version, the weak reference is called with `()` to retrieve the actual object before passing it to `_engine_type`. This ensures that the weak reference is maintained throughout the function's execution, preventing premature garbage collection and addressing the bug.
