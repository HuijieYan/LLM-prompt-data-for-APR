## Analysis
The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object and then passing it to `_engine_type` method along with the length of `self`. However, the issue arises when the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before intended, causing `_engine_type` to receive `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

## Bug Cause
The bug causes the weak reference to `self` to be lost before it is passed to `_engine_type`, resulting in `_engine_type` receiving `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` remains valid until it is passed to `_engine_type`. One way to achieve this is by storing the weak reference in a local variable within the `_engine` method to extend its lifetime until it is used.

## Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference in a local variable to prevent it from being lost prematurely
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    period_index = period()
    return self._engine_type(period_index, len(self))
```
