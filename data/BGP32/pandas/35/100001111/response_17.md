## Explanation
The bug in the `_engine` function is due to the usage of `weakref.ref(self)` which creates a weak reference to `self`, but this reference is not being properly passed to `_engine_type` resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex` object.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference created by `weakref.ref(self)` is properly passed to `_engine_type`.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

In the corrected version, `period()` is called to retrieve the original `self` object from the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`. This ensures that `_engine_type` receives the intended `PeriodIndex` object rather than `None`.
