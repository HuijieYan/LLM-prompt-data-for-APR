## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is intended to return a weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` instance to avoid reference cycles. However, the bug in the function is with how the weak reference is created. The function mistakenly creates a weak reference to `self` and assigns it to the variable `period`, but it should be assigned to `_self`.

The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped prematurely, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

## Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to correctly create a weak reference to `self` within the function. So, the fix involves assigning the weak reference to `_self` instead of `period`.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    _self = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(_self, len(self))
``` 

By making this change to the function, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance will be maintained until the `PeriodEngine` receives it, fixing the issue and ensuring the expected output.
