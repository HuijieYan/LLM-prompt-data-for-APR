## Bug Fix

### Error Location
The bug is located in the `_engine` function where a weak reference to the `self` object is created but not properly utilized in the subsequent `self._engine_type` call.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug arises from the weak reference creation and usage. As per the GitHub issue, the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before the intended usage, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This causes unexpected behavior and errors when accessing attributes of the `PeriodIndex`.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is correctly used within the `_engine` function to avoid premature dropping of the reference.

### Corrected Version

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we use `period()` instead of just `period` when calling the `_engine_type` function. This ensures that the weak reference is accessed before being used. This change should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and provide the expected behavior for the `PeriodIndex` object.
