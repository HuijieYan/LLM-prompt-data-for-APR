## Fixing the bug

### Error location:
The bug is located in the `_engine` function of the pandas.core.indexes.period module. The issue arises when creating a weak reference to the PeriodIndex object and passing it to the `_engine_type` constructor, as the weak reference is not maintained correctly, causing it to be dropped prematurely.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the weak reference to the PeriodIndex object is not being maintained properly when passed to the `_engine_type` constructor. This causes the weak reference to be dropped before it is intended to, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the actual PeriodIndex object.

### Fix strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex object is maintained throughout the `_engine` function's execution until it is used by the `_engine_type` constructor. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference in a variable outside the scope of the function, ensuring its persistence.

### Corrected version of the function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a weak reference to self outside the function
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    # Pass the weak reference to _engine_type
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference `period_ref` outside the `_engine` function, we ensure that the reference to the PeriodIndex object is maintained until it is used by the `_engine_type` constructor, fixing the bug related to weak references being dropped prematurely.
