## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is utilizing `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is an instance of `PeriodIndex`. However, when using this weak reference in `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, it seems that the weak reference is not being dereferenced correctly, resulting in `None` being passed instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

## Bug Explanation
The issue arises due to the weak reference not being correctly dereferenced in the `_engine` function, leading to passing `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`, which results in unexpected behavior and errors.

## Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is correctly dereferenced before being used in `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. This can be achieved by calling `period()` on the weak reference, which returns the referenced object if it still exists.

## Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    deref_period = period()
    return self._engine_type(deref_period, len(self))
```

This corrected version should address the bug and ensure that the `PeriodIndex` object is correctly passed to `_engine_type` without being lost due to weak referencing issues.
