### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_engine` function is due to the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference of the `self` object. The `weakref.ref` function returns a weak reference object, not the actual object itself.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to correctly use the weak reference object to avoid creating a reference cycle. We can modify the `_engine` function to create a weak reference object for `self` and then access the actual object using the weak reference in `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
