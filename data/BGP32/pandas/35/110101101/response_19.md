Based on the information provided, it seems that the bug is related to the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class. The function is trying to create a weak reference to `self`, but it is not done correctly, leading to potential issues.

The primary issue here is that `weakref.ref(self)` should be used to create a weak reference to `self` instead of `period = weakref.ref(self)`. The corrected version should return the weak reference of `self` directly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```

By directly returning the weak reference of `self`, the function should now correctly avoid the reference cycle issue.

This correction should address the bug and make the failing test pass.
