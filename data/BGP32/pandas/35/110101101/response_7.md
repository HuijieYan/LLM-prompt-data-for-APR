### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_engine` function is due to the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`. Weak references are used to avoid creating cyclic references that prevent objects from being garbage collected. In this case, `weakref.ref(self)` does not create a reference to the object `self` but a callable wrapper around `self`, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should modify the `_engine` function to use `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`. This will create a weak proxy reference to `self` instead of a callable wrapper, allowing the function to work correctly without introducing cyclic references.

### Corrected Version of the _engine Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
