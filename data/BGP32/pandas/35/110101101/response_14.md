### Bug Explanation
The bug lies in the `_engine` function where `weakref.ref(self)` is causing the issue. By using `weakref.ref(self)`, we are creating a weak reference to `self` which is not what is intended in this case. This leads to incorrect behavior when the `_engine_type` function is called later with this weak reference.

### Fix Strategy
Instead of creating a weak reference to `self`, we should directly pass `self` to the `_engine_type` function. This will ensure that the correct reference is used when constructing the engine.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
