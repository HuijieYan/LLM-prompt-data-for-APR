The bug in the `_engine` function lies in the usage of `weakref.ref(self)` which creates a weak reference to `self`. This weak reference is not being utilized correctly, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, we should directly pass `self` to the `_engine_type` constructor instead of using `weakref.ref(self)`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

This fix ensures that `self` is passed as a reference to `_engine_type`, resolving the issue with the weak reference and addressing the bug. This corrected version should pass the failing test case and provide the expected output.
