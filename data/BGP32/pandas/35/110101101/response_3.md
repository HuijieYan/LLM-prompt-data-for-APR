## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_engine` function arises from the usage of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`. When the `PeriodIndex` instance is passed as an argument to `_engine_type`, it is passed as a weak reference which causes issues with the subsequent operations.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should directly pass `self` to `_engine_type` instead of creating a weak reference. This will ensure that the `PeriodIndex` instance is passed correctly.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
``` 

After making this change, the `_engine` function will now correctly pass the `self` parameter to `_engine_type`, resolving the weak reference issue and ensuring the function operates as expected.
