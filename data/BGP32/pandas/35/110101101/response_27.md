### Explanation:
The bug in the `_engine` function lies in the way the weak reference `period` is being created. Instead of storing a reference to the `self` object, the code is storing a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` class itself. This results in incorrect behavior when trying to access attributes and methods of the `PeriodIndex` instance.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly create a weak reference to the `self` object (the `PeriodIndex` instance) rather than the class.

### Corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to the PeriodIndex instance
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
