### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_engine` function is due to the usage of `weakref.ref(self)` which creates a weak reference to `self`. This weak reference does not hold a strong reference, so it could get garbage collected at any moment, leading to unexpected behavior or segmentation faults.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that a strong reference to `self` is maintained within the `_engine` function.

### Corrected Version
```python
    # Corrected _engine function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
