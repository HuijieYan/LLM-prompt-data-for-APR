The bug in the `_engine` function lies in the usage of `weakref.ref(self)` instead of directly passing `self` to `_engine_type`.

### Cause of the bug:
When using `weakref.ref(self)`, a weak reference to `self` is created which might not maintain the reference count of `self`. This can lead to unexpected behavior when `_engine_type` tries to access `self`.

### Fix strategy:
Instead of using `weakref.ref(self)`, directly pass `self` to `_engine_type` to ensure that the reference count is maintained correctly.

### Updated and Corrected `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
``` 

By making this change, the corrected function should pass the failing test case.
