## Fixing the bug
The bug in the `_engine` function arises from the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref(self)`. The `weakref.ref` call is creating a weak reference object to `self` which is not what is intended here. Instead, we need to pass `self` directly to the `_engine_type` constructor.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `_engine` function to directly pass `self` to the `_engine_type`.

## Corrected version of the `_engine` function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
``` 

By making this change, the `_engine` function will correctly initialize the `_engine_type` with a reference to `self` as intended, resolving the bug and ensuring that the test passes.
