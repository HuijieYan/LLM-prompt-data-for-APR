### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_engine` function arises from the usage of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`. The weak reference does not preserve the original object and can be garbage collected anytime, leading to issues when accessing the weak reference later on.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we should avoid using `weakref.ref` and directly pass `self` to `_engine_type` without creating a weak reference.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
