## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_engine` function is caused by the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref`. The `weakref.ref` function returns a weak reference object, but it needs to be dereferenced using the `()` operator to obtain the actual object. In the current implementation, `period` is assigned the weak reference object without dereferencing it. This results in `period` holding a reference to the weak reference object instead of the actual `PeriodIndex` object.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to properly dereference the weak reference object obtained from `weakref.ref(self)` by using `()` to access the actual `PeriodIndex` object.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By making this modification, the `_engine` function will now correctly obtain the actual `PeriodIndex` object from the weak reference created by `weakref.ref(self)()`, ensuring that the function operates as expected.
