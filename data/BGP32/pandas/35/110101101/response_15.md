Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class is related to how the weak reference `period` is created and passed to `_engine_type`. The `weakref.ref()` function is used incorrectly, which may lead to issues with reference management.

The cause of the bug is likely due to incorrect usage of the `weakref.ref()` function, which should be used to create a weak reference to the `self` object. However, in the current implementation, `period` is assigned a weak reference to `self`, but `self` is passed directly to `_engine_type`.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly create a weak reference to `self` and pass that weak reference to `_engine_type`. This will ensure proper reference management and prevent reference cycles.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Pass the weak reference to _engine_type
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By making this change, the `_engine` function should now correctly handle the weak reference creation and eliminate the bug that caused the failing test case.
