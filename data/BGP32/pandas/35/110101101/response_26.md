The bug in the `_engine` function is caused by incorrectly using a weak reference to `self` and passing it to `_engine_type`. This can lead to unexpected behavior and errors.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `_engine` function to directly pass `self` to `_engine_type` without using weak references.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By directly passing `self` to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the correct reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is used, avoiding any potential issues with weak references.

This modification should address the bug and make the failing test pass as expected.
