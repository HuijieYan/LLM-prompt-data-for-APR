## Bug Analysis
The `@cache_readonly` decorator is used to cache the return value of the `_engine` function for subsequent calls. However, the issue arises from the way a weak reference is being created to `self` within the function. The `weakref.ref(self)` call creates a weak reference, but it does not store a strong reference to `self`, leading to the weak reference being garbage collected prematurely.

## Bug Explanation
In the given buggy function, when trying to create a weak reference to `self` using `period = weakref.ref(self)`, the weak reference object `period` is not holding a strong reference to `self`. As a result, when `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` is called to instantiate the `_engine_type` object, `self` might already be garbage collected since the weak reference couldn't prevent it.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this issue, we need to ensure that a strong reference to `self` is maintained throughout the `_engine` function. One way to achieve this is by creating a local variable that holds a strong reference to `self`. This will prevent `self` from being prematurely garbage collected.

## Corrected Version

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a strong reference to self
    self_reference = self
    period = weakref.ref(self_reference)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By creating a local variable `self_reference` and assigning `self` to it, we ensure that a strong reference to `self` is held by the function until it is no longer needed. This fix should prevent the premature garbage collection issue and make the function work correctly.
