The bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class is caused by how the weak reference is being used. In the current implementation, `weakref.ref(self)` creates a weak reference to the `self` object, but the weak reference itself is not being dereferenced correctly when creating the `_engine_type` object, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to dereference the weak reference before passing it to the `_engine_type` constructor.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` instead of just passing `period`, we are dereferencing the weak reference and obtaining the actual `self` object before passing it to `_engine_type`.

This fix ensures that the `_engine` function operates correctly with weak references in the `PeriodIndex` class.
