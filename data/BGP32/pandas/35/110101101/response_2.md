### Explanation
The buggy function `_engine` is returning an instance of `_engine_type` with a weak reference to `self`, but it is not handling it correctly. The weak reference is being assigned to a variable `period`, but it should actually be passed as an argument to `_engine_type`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the `_engine` function to accept `period` as an argument to properly handle the weak reference.
2. Update the call to `_engine_type` to pass the weak reference `period` and the length of `self`.

### Correction of the Buggy Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
