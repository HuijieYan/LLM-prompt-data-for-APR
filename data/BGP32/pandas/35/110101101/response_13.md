## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class is caused by the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref(self)`. When `weakref.ref(self)` is called, it returns a weak reference to the `self` object. However, this weak reference is not stored anywhere and is not accessible. When the weak reference is passed to `self._engine_type` as an argument, it essentially results in passing a `None` value instead of the intended `self` object.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to properly store the weak reference to the `self` object before passing it to `self._engine_type`. This way, we ensure that the `self` object is accessible and can be used in the `_engine_type` constructor.

## The Corrected Version

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    # Obtain the actual self object from the weak reference
    period_self = period()
    
    # Pass the actual self object to _engine_type
    return period_self._engine_type(period_self, len(period_self))
```
