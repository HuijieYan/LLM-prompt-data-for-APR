### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_engine` function occurs due to the use of `weakref.ref(self)` instead of directly passing `self` to `_engine_type`. This results in a weak reference to `self` being created and passed to `_engine_type`, leading to unexpected behavior in the engine creation process.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, remove the `weakref.ref` usage and directly pass `self` to `_engine_type` in the `_engine` function.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
