### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is the `PeriodIndex` object. This weak reference is then passed to `_engine_type` along with the length of the `PeriodIndex`.

The issue here is that `weakref.ref(self)` creates a weak reference object, not the actual reference to `self`. This means that `_engine_type` is receiving a weak reference object, instead of the actual `PeriodIndex` object, causing the bug.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by passing a weak reference object instead of the actual `PeriodIndex` object to `_engine_type`. This weak reference object does not provide the access to `self` needed by `_engine_type`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to pass the actual `self` (the `PeriodIndex` object) to `_engine_type`, instead of a weak reference object. We can simply remove the `weakref.ref` around `self` in the `_engine` function.

### Corrected Code
```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
