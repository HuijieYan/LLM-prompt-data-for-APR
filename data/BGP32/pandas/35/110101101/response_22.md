The issue in the provided `_engine` function is that it is trying to create a weak reference to the `self` object incorrectly. Instead of using `weakref.ref(self)`, we should create a weak reference to the `self` object by passing `self` directly to `weakref.proxy`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.proxy(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference to the `self` object will be created properly, and the test case `test_get_level_values_when_periods` should pass as expected.
