### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class returns an instance of the `_engine_type` class by passing a weak reference to `self`. However, the weak reference is not being used correctly, leading to a reference cycle issue.

### Bug Explanation
The bug originates from the usage of `weakref.ref(self)` inside the `_engine` function. The `weakref.ref` function returns a weak reference object, but this weak reference object is not being correctly utilized to avoid a reference cycle. The reference to `self` inside the weak reference object should be accessed using the `.()` method to obtain a strong reference when needed. This misuse of weak references leads to unexpected behavior in memory management.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the weak reference to `self` obtained using `weakref.ref(self)` should be correctly dereferenced before passing it to `_engine_type`. This can be done by calling the weak reference object, which will return the original object if it still exists. This will avoid the reference cycle issue.

### Corrected Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By dereferencing the weak reference using `period()`, the strong reference to `self` is obtained and passed to `_engine_type`, preventing the reference cycle issue. This corrected version should now properly handle weak references and avoid the original bug.
