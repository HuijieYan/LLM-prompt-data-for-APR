### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_engine` function lies in the way it creates a weak reference to the `self` object. In the buggy code, `period = weakref.ref(self)` creates a weak reference to `self` but does not retain a reference to the object, leading to it being garbage collected prematurely. This results in a weak reference not being valid when `_engine_type` is called, causing the test to fail.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained properly throughout the `_engine` function's lifetime. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference in a class attribute or using a method that retains a reference to the object.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference in the `self._period_weakref` attribute, we maintain a reference to `self` throughout the lifetime of the `_engine` function, ensuring that the weak reference remains valid when needed.
