The issue in the buggy function lies in the way the weak reference `period` is being created. The `weakref.ref()` function creates a weak reference to the object `self`, but the reference should be stored as a callable in order to retrieve the actual object when needed.

To fix the bug, we need to store the weak reference as a callable function. Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref callable of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the `_engine` function should now correctly pass the failing test and provide the expected output values.
