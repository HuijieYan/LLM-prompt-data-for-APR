The issue in the buggy function `_engine` lies in the way it handles the weak reference `period`. The correct approach is to access the original object using the weak reference within the `_engine_type` method. However, the code is passing the weak reference itself to `_engine_type`, which leads to unexpected behavior.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `_engine` function to dereference the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
    # corrected version of the buggy function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a dereferenced weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By dereferencing `period` using `period()`, we can access the original `self` object stored in the weak reference.

This correction should resolve the issue and make the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` pass successfully.
