### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, but it is not handling the weak reference properly when passing it to `_engine_type`. This is causing issues when creating the engine object.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the weak reference created by `weakref.ref(self)` does not hold a strong reference to the object `self`. Therefore, when `self` is passed to `_engine_type`, it might get garbage-collected, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference created by `weakref.ref(self)` is properly handled. One way to do this is to store the weak reference in a local variable and then use `.dereference()` to access the referred object at the proper moment.

### Corrected Version
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref.dereference(), len(self))
``` 

This corrected version stores the weak reference to `self` in the `period_ref` local variable and then dereferences it before passing it to `_engine_type`. This ensures that `self` is not prematurely garbage-collected.
