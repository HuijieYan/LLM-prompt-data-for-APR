### Explanation
The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` and pass it to `_engine_type`. The intent here is to avoid creating a reference cycle. However, due to how weak references work, `period` becomes a weak reference instead of just a reference to `self`. This results in `self` being garbage collected when `_engine_type` is being called, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
Instead of using `weakref.ref(self)`, we can simply pass `self` directly to `_engine_type` to ensure that `self` is not garbage collected while `_engine_type` is being executed.

### The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
