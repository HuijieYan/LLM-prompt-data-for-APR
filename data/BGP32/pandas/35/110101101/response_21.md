### Explanation
The buggy function `_engine` is trying to create a weak reference to `self` and then pass it to `_engine_type`. The issue here is that `weakref.ref()` creates a weak reference object, but does not retrieve the actual object referred to, so passing `period` (which is a weak reference) to `_engine_type` is incorrect. 

Additionally, the correct approach should be to hold a strong reference to `self` inside the `_engine` method, because `_engine_type` is expecting the actual object and not a weak reference.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we should remove the `weakref.ref()` call and directly pass `self` to `_engine_type` method.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
