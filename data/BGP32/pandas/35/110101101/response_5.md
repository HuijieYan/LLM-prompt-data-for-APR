The bug in the `_engine` function arises from the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref`. The `weakref.ref` function returns a weak reference to the object but does not return the object itself. Instead, it returns a BoundMethodWeakref object, leading to unexpected behavior in the `_engine_type` call.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `_engine` function to directly pass `self` to the `_engine_type` function instead of using `weakref.ref`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By directly passing `self` to the `_engine_type` function, we ensure that the correct object reference is passed. This will resolve the bug and allow the failing test to pass.
