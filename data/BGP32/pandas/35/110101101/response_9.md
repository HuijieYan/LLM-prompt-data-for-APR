## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is intended to return an instance of `_engine_type` based on the input `self` and the length of the PeriodIndex. However, the implementation is flawed as it creates a weak reference to `self` using `weakref.ref(self)` and then attempts to pass this weak reference to `_engine_type`. This approach is incorrect because `_engine_type` most likely expects a direct reference to `self` instead of a weak reference.

## Bug Explanation
By using `period = weakref.ref(self)`, the function is creating a weak reference object to `self` instead of preserving a direct reference. This weak reference is not suitable for the subsequent creation of `_engine_type`, which expects a direct reference to `self`. This inconsistency in reference types leads to unexpected behavior, likely resulting in a failure to create the `_engine_type` instance correctly.

## Proposed Fix
To resolve the bug, we should avoid using `weakref.ref(self)` and directly pass `self` to `_engine_type`. This change will ensure that a direct reference is provided to `_engine_type`, aligning with its expected input.

## Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
