### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_engine` is meant to return an engine type based on the PeriodIndex object.
- The error message indicates an `AttributeError` with 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'.
- The error occurs when trying to access `.view("i8")` on a `NoneType` object within the `_engine` property.

### Potential Error Location:
The potential location where the error occurs is in the line:
```python
return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

### Cause of Bug:
The bug is caused by the fact that `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` is returning a `NoneType` value instead of the expected engine object, leading to the AttributeError when trying to access `.view("i8")` on the `NoneType` object.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` returns the correct engine object instead of `None`. This can be done by checking the return value of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` before returning it in the `_engine` function.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_instance = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine_instance is not None:
        return engine_instance
    else:
        raise ValueError("Engine type is None. Error occurred.")
``` 

In this corrected version, we check if `engine_instance` is `None` after calling `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, and if it is `None`, we raise a `ValueError` indicating that the engine type is `None`. This ensures that we don't encounter the `AttributeError` caused by accessing methods on a `NoneType` object.
