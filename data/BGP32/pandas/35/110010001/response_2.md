1. The buggy function is `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class. The error message is indicating an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` which occurs when trying to access an attribute of a None object.

2. The potential error location seems to be within the `_engine` function where it assigns a weak reference to `self` and then uses that reference to initialize the engine type.

3. The bug is likely caused by the weak reference being passed incorrectly to the `_engine_type` resulting in `None` being passed instead of the actual object.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is correctly passed and used to obtain the actual object. This can be achieved by ensuring that the weak reference is dereferenced properly.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class:

```python
# corrected _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By invoking the `period` weak reference using `()` in `period()`, we dereference the weak reference and pass the actual object to the `_engine_type`, resolving the issue of passing `None` instead of the object. This correction should fix the AttributeError.
