### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` method within the `PeriodIndex` class.
2. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` related to a `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.
3. The cause of the bug seems to be related to the fact that the `_engine` method is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, where there might be an issue with the `_engine_type` not initializing properly.
4. We need to ensure that the `_engine_type` is properly initialized before calling `view("i8")` on it.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if the `_engine_type` is being initialized correctly within the `PeriodIndex` class.
2. Ensure that the `_engine_type` is not returning `None`.
3. Modify the `_engine` function to handle the case where `_engine_type` might be `None`.
4. Initialize `_engine_type` properly if required.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        if self._engine_type is None:
            raise TypeError("_engine_type is not properly initialized")
            
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In this corrected version, we added a check to ensure that `_engine_type` is not `None` before calling `view("i8")` on it. We raise a `TypeError` if `_engine_type` is not initialized properly.
