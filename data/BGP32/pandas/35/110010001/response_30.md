1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` function within the `PeriodIndex` class. The purpose of this function is to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance and then use it to create an `_engine_type` object.

2. The potential error in the buggy function lies in the line `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. This line tries to create an `_engine_type` object using a weak reference `period`, which might lead to the error mentioned in the error message.

3. The cause of the bug seems to be related to the weak reference `period` becoming `None` before the `_engine_type` object is created, resulting in an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute on a `NoneType` object.

4. To fix the bug, a possible strategy would be to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance is properly handled and not becoming `None` prematurely. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference outside of the `_engine` function to prevent it from being garbage collected.

### Corrected Version:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Store the weak reference outside of the function to prevent early garbage collection
        self._weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(self._weak_period, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference `self._weak_period` as an attribute of the `PeriodIndex` instance, it ensures that the reference will persist as long as the `PeriodIndex` object exists, correcting the issue of the weak reference becoming `None` prematurely.
