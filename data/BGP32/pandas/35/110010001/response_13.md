**Analysis:**
- The buggy function `_engine` is part of the `PeriodIndex` class in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file.
- The error message occurs when calling `idx2.levels` and checking if each level is monotonic. This eventually leads to `_engine.is_monotonic_increasing`, resulting in an `AttributeError` of `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.
- The `_engine` function is attempting to create an instance of `_engine_type` and return it, but due to improper handling of weak references, it is returning `None`.

**Cause of the Bug:**
- The bug is caused by the weak reference usage in the `_engine` function. When creating a weak reference to `self`, it is not properly being passed to `_engine_type`, leading to an invalid return value of `None`.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**
- Instead of creating a weak reference within `_engine`, pass the actual `self` reference to `_engine_type`. This way, the correct object reference will be used to create an instance of `_engine_type`.

**Corrected Version:**
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Pass the actual self instance to _engine_type
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
