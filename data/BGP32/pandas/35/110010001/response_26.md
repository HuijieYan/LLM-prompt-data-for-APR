### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a cached readonly property that returns an instance of `_engine_type` by passing a weak reference of `self` and the length of the PeriodIndex.
2. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` with the message `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, which suggests that the `_engine` property is returning a `NoneType` object instead of the expected engine.
3. The issue seems to be with how the weak reference `period` is created and passed to `_engine_type`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is correctly created and used within the `_engine` property.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the weak reference `period` is properly maintained to avoid circular references.
2. Validate the creation of the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type` to prevent returning a `NoneType` object.
3. Modify the `_engine` property to handle weak references correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def __init__(self, data=None, freq=None, copy=False, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(data=data, copy=copy)
        self.freq = freq

    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Create a weakref to self to avoid reference cycles
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if period() is not None else None
``` 

By implementing the corrected version above, we ensure that the weak reference is properly handled within the `_engine` property to avoid returning a NoneType object. This should address the AttributeError issue raised in the failing test.
