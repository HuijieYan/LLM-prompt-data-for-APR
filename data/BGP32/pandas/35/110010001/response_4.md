### Analysis:
1. The error occurs when trying to access the `view` attribute on a `NoneType` object in the `_do_monotonic_check` method of the `IndexEngine` class.
2. The error message indicates that the `_engine` attribute of the `PeriodIndex` object is returning `None`, leading to this AttributeError.
3. The `_engine` method in the `PeriodIndex` class is supposed to return an instance of the `_engine_type` class with some arguments, but in its current form, it returns `None` due to the weak reference usage.
4. One strategy to fix this bug is to modify the `_engine` method to ensure that it correctly returns an instance of `_engine_type` class with the necessary arguments.

### Correction:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))  # Change weakref call from period to period()
``` 

By changing the weakref call from `period` to `period()`, we are correctly dereferencing the weak reference object to obtain the original object and pass it as an argument to `_engine_type`. This should fix the bug and ensure that `_engine` returns a valid engine object.
