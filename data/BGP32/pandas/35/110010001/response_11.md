### Analysis:
- The error message indicates an AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'
- The failing test is related to the use of the `_engine` attribute in the `PeriodEngine` class, which is defined in the `PeriodIndex` class.
- The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`
- The error occurs when trying to access the `view` attribute on a 'NoneType' object, which suggests that the `_engine_type` function is not returning a valid object in this case.
- This behavior is likely due to the return type of the `_engine_type` function when called with `period` and `len(self)`.

### Potential error location:
- The issue may be in the implementation of the `_engine_type` function that is being called with a weak reference `period` and the length of `self` as arguments.

### Bug Cause:
- The `_engine_type` function is returning a `NoneType` object instead of the expected engine object, leading to the AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- We need to ensure that the `_engine_type` function returns a valid engine object instead of `None`.
- One possible strategy is to check the return value of the `_engine_type` function and handle cases where it returns `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("Failed to create engine object.")
    return engine
``` 

By adding a check for a `None` return value from the `_engine_type` function, we can prevent the AttributeError caused by a 'NoneType' object.
