1. The error message indicates that the 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'. This points to an issue with the PeriodEngine class being used within the _engine function of the 'PeriodIndex' class.

2. The potential error location is within the implementation of the _engine function where an instance of the 'PeriodEngine' class is being created.

3. The cause of the bug is likely due to the PeriodEngine class not being initialized properly within the _engine function. This results in the engine object being set to 'None', leading to the 'NoneType' object error.

4. One strategy to fix this bug is to ensure that the PeriodEngine class is correctly initialized within the _engine function, so that it returns an instance of PeriodEngine instead of 'None'.

5. Here is the corrected version of the _engine function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if self._engine_type is not None else None
```

By checking if the self._engine_type is not None before creating an instance of PeriodEngine, we prevent the issue of returning a 'None' object and avoid the AttributeError when trying to access the 'view' attribute.
