### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is responsible for initializing the engine for the `PeriodIndex` class.
2. The error message indicates that there is an `AttributeError` due to a `NoneType` object not having the attribute 'view'.
3. The bug is likely caused by `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` returning `None` instead of an actual engine.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` returns a valid engine object.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the `_engine_type` method returns a valid engine object and not `None`. This can be achieved by checking the implementation of `_engine_type` method and correcting any issues related to it.

### Corrected Version:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("Engine initialization failed, returned None.")
    return engine
``` 

In this corrected version, we explicitly check if the `engine` returned by `_engine_type` is `None` and raise a `ValueError` if it is. This ensures that the `engine` object returned by `_engine_type` is valid and not `None`.
