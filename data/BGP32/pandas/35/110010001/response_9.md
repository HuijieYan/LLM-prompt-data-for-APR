### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is trying to return an instance of `PeriodEngine` using `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. However, there seems to be an issue with the implementation of `PeriodEngine` or its initialization, as indicated by the error message mentioning that a 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'.

### Error Location:
The error is likely within the implementation of the `_engine_type` method or the initialization of the `PeriodEngine` class.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the `PeriodEngine` instance not being properly created or initialized within the `_engine` method. This results in the `_engine` method returning a 'NoneType' object instead of the expected `PeriodEngine` instance.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, you need to ensure that the `PeriodEngine` is properly initialized and returned by the `_engine` method. This may involve checking the implementation of `PeriodEngine` and `self._engine_type`, and ensuring that the `PeriodEngine` instance is created correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return PeriodEngine(self, len(self))
```

In the corrected version above, the `_engine` method directly creates and returns a `PeriodEngine` instance using `PeriodEngine(self, len(self))`. This should address the issue of returning a 'NoneType' object. Make sure to replace `PeriodEngine` with the actual name of the engine class you are using.
