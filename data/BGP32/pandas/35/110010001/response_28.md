### Analysis:
- The `PeriodIndex` class contains a `_engine` method that is decorated with `@cache_readonly`.
- The `_engine` method is expected to return an instance of the `_engine_type` class.
- The error message indicates an `AttributeError` with a message `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, which suggests that the `_engine` method is returning a `NoneType` object instead of the expected object.

### Potential Error Location:
The issue is likely in the following line:
```python
return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
The `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` call may be returning `None` instead of an instance of the `_engine_type` class.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by either the `_engine_type` class not being properly initialized or an issue within the `_engine_type` class implementation, leading to an instance not being created correctly and returned.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine_type` class is properly initialized and returns an instance of it in the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class. We should investigate the `_engine_type` class and its initialization to identify the root cause of the issue.

### Corrected Version:
To fix the bug, we can modify the `_engine` method to ensure that it properly initializes and returns an instance of the `_engine_type` class. Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_instance = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine_instance is None:
        # Handle the case where _engine_type failed to create an instance
        raise ValueError("Failed to create _engine_type instance")
    return engine_instance
```

By checking if `engine_instance` is `None` after creating an instance of `_engine_type`, we can ensure that a valid instance is returned. This modification should prevent the `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error from occurring.
