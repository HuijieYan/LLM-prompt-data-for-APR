### Analysis:
- The error message indicates the presence of an `AttributeError` in the `PeriodEngine` class, specifically in the `vgetter()` method.
- The error is raised due to a `NoneType` object not having the attribute `view`.
- The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is passing a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type` which might be causing the issue in creating the `PeriodEngine`.

### Identify Potential Error Locations:
1. The weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` might not be correctly passed to `_engine_type`.
2. The initialization or usage of the `PeriodEngine` within `_engine` function might be incorrect.

### Cause of the Bug:
The buggy function `_engine` is not correctly handling the creation or initialization of `PeriodEngine` which is causing the `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view()` method on a `NoneType` object.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the weak reference passed to `_engine_type` is correctly handled.
2. Verify the initialization of the `PeriodEngine` within `_engine` function to avoid creating a `NoneType` object.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def _engine(self):
        # Corrected weak reference handling
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        
        # Check before using _engine_type
        if self._engine_type is None:
            return None  # Or handle this according to the logic of your application
            
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By incorporating these changes, we ensure that the weak reference is correctly passed and the `_engine_type` is available to create the `PeriodEngine` instance without resulting in a `NoneType` object. This should fix the `AttributeError` issue observed in the failing test.
