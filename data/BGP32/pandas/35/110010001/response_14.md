### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is returning the result of calling `_engine_type` with `period` and `len(self)` as arguments. However, the issue lies in how `period` is being passed as an argument. It is being passed as a weak reference `weakref.ref(self)` rather than the actual object that is needed for the `_engine_type` function.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The usage of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`.
2. The return statement that is passing the weak reference instead of the actual object.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by passing a weak reference object to the `_engine_type` function instead of the actual object. This results in an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` because the weak reference does not hold the correct reference.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
Replace the `weakref.ref(self)` with `self` directly when passing to `_engine_type`. This will ensure that the actual object is passed to the `_engine_type` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# this is the corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
