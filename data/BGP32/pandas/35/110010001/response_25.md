## Analysis:
- The buggy function in question is `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class.
- The error occurs when trying to access the `_engine` attribute of an instance of `PeriodIndex`.
- The error message indicates an `AttributeError` with the message `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.
- This error suggests that the `_engine` attribute is not being properly initialized and is returning `None` instead of an expected object.

## Potential Error Locations:
- The issue may be with the weak reference usage in the `_engine` function.
- The weak reference may not be holding the reference to the period correctly leading to `None` being returned.
- The assignment of `period = weakref.ref(self)` might not be functioning as intended.

## Bug Cause:
- The `weakref.ref(self)` usage is causing the problem because a weak reference alone does not hold a strong reference to the object it is referencing. This means that the object can be garbage collected while leaving a weak reference behind returning `None`.
- Due to this behavior, the `_engine` method might be returning `None` instead of the intended object.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `weakref` reference does not release the object prematurely.
- One solution could be to store a strong reference temporarily to avoid the premature garbage collection.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# Updated and corrected implementation of the '_engine' function

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    strong_self = self  # Create a strong reference before passing to weakref
    period = weakref.ref(strong_self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By creating a temporary strong reference `strong_self`, we ensure that the object will not be garbage collected before we create a weak reference to it. This should prevent the error that was occurring in the original function.
