### Analysis:
1. The buggy function in question is `_engine` defined within the `PeriodIndex` class. The function is using the `cache_readonly` decorator to cache the result of the `_engine_type` method call.
   
2. The error message indicates an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` during the execution of the `is_monotonic_increasing` method, which ultimately references the `_engine` attribute.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `_engine_type` method might be returning `None` instead of an actual object, causing the AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute on a `NoneType` object within the `_do_monotonic_check` method.

4. One potential strategy to fix the bug is to ensure that the `_engine_type` method returns a valid object (not None) when called with the `period` and length arguments.

### Corrected Version:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)  # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type returned None")
    return engine
```

By checking if `engine` is None after calling `_engine_type` and raising a `ValueError` if it is, we can ensure that the `_engine` method returns a valid object, thus fixing the bug and preventing the `NoneType` AttributeError.
