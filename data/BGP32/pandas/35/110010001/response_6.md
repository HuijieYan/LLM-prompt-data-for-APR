### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` function within the `PeriodIndex` class.
2. The purpose of this function is to return an instance of `_engine_type` class initialized with a weak reference to `self` (the `PeriodIndex` object) and the length of the index.
3. The error message occurs when accessing the `is_monotonic` attribute of `idx2.levels` in the failing test. It points to an `AttributeError` in the `is_monotonic_increasing` method of the `IndexEngine` class, specifically when trying to access `self._engine.is_monotonic_increasing`. The error message indicates that a `NoneType` object does not have the `view` attribute, suggesting that `_engine` is returning `None`.
4. The bug seems to be in the `_engine` function, where it is not returning the correct instance of `_engine_type`. This leads to `self._engine` being `None` when trying to access its attributes.
   
### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine` function returns an instance of `_engine_type` correctly. This can be achieved by properly initializing the `_engine` object within the function.
  
### Updated/Copied Version of the Function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if self._engine_type is not None else None
```

In the updated version, we are explicitly checking if `_engine_type` is not `None` before returning an instance of `_engine_type` initialized with the weak reference and the length of the `PeriodIndex`. This change should prevent the `NoneType` error when accessing the `_engine` attribute.
