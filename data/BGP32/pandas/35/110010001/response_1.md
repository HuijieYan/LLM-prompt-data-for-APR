### Analysis:
- The error occurs when trying to access the `view` attribute on a `NoneType` object.
- The traceback indicates that the issue is related to the `_engine` attribute of the `PeriodEngine` class in the `pandas._libs.index` module.
- The `_engine` attribute of the `PeriodIndex` class is defined as a `@cache_readonly` property returning an instance of `_engine_type`.

### Bug Cause:
- The `_engine` function returns a weak reference to `self`, but it should return the actual reference to the `self` object.
- Due to this weak reference return, the actual `_engine` attribute is set to `None`, causing the error when trying to access its `view` attribute.

### Fix Strategy:
- Modify the `_engine` function to return a reference to the `self` object instead of a weak reference.

### Corrected Code:
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
