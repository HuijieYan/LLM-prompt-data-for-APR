### Analysis:
- The `PeriodIndex` class contains a `_engine` method that utilizes a weak reference to the class instance.
- The error message occurs when trying to access the `is_monotonic` property of the levels in the `MultiIndex`.
- The error indicates that there is an issue with the `PeriodEngine` trying to access an attribute of type `NoneType`.

### Potential Error Locations:
- The issue might be related to the implementation of the `_engine` method in the `PeriodIndex` class where the `_engine_type` might be returning `None` causing the error in subsequent operations.

### Bug Cause:
- The `_engine` method is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, but if `_engine_type` does not return a valid object, it could lead to the observed `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` when trying to access properties of the `PeriodEngine`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Check the implementation of the `_engine_type` method to ensure it is returning a correct object.
- Ensure that the `_engine` method provides a valid instance of the engine to avoid the `NoneType` error.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("Engine creation failed")
    return engine
```

In the corrected version above, we added a check to ensure that the `_engine_type` method does not return `None`. If it does, it raises a `ValueError`. This modification should prevent the `NoneType` error when accessing attributes of the engine.
