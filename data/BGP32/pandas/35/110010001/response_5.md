### Analysis:
- The error message points to an AttributeError in the `PeriodEngine` class, specifically in the `vgetter()` method which returns a 'NoneType' object.
- The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is returning an incorrect value or None which leads to an AttributeError in the underlying `PeriodEngine`.

### Potential Error Locations:
- The `weakref.ref(self)` might not be correctly capturing a reference to `self`, leading to the returned value as None.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` call in the `_engine` function might be returning None instead of the expected engine object, due to issues with the weak reference.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Ensure that the weak reference is handled correctly to capture the reference to `self` properly.
- Verify that `_engine_type` is returning a valid engine object or handle the case when it returns `None`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("Engine cannot be None")
    return engine
```

By ensuring that the `_engine` function handles the case when `_engine_type` returns `None`, we avoid the AttributeError that was occurring due to a 'NoneType' object being encountered in the subsequent code.
