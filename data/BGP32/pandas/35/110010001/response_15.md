1. The buggy function `_engine` is defined within the `PeriodIndex` class, which inherits from `Int64Index`.
2. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` related to a `NoneType` object not having the attribute `view`.
3. The bug occurs when accessing the `_engine` attribute in the context of `is_monotonic_increasing`.
4. The strategy for fixing the bug involves ensuring that the `self._engine` attribute is properly initialized and not `None` during the `is_monotonic_increasing` check.
5. Here is a corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    if hasattr(self, '_engine_type'):
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        raise AttributeError("'_engine_type' attribute missing in PeriodIndex.")
``` 

By including a check for the existence of the `_engine_type` attribute before creating the `period` weakref, the corrected version ensures that the `_engine` function does not return a `NoneType` object, thus preventing the `AttributeError` encountered during the test.
