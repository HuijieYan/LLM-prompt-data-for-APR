## Analysis:
1. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` raised in the `PeriodIndex` class when accessing the `is_monotonic` property of the `idx2` variable.

2. The error is related to the `_engine` property in the `PeriodIndex` class which is returning a `NoneType` object, leading to the AttributeError.

3. The bug is caused by the `weakref.ref(self)` being used incorrectly within the `_engine` function. The weak reference is not able to properly maintain a reference to the PeriodIndex object, resulting in a `None` object when trying to access it later.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is correctly maintained and accessed within the `_engine` function.

## Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` when creating the engine instance, we retrieve the actual object from the weak reference before passing it to the engine constructor.

This change ensures that the proper reference to the `self` object is maintained, fixing the issue with the `AttributeError` being raised.
