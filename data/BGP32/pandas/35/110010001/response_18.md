### Analysis:
- The error message indicates that there is an `AttributeError` in the `PeriodEngine` class where an object of type 'NoneType' does not have the attribute 'view'.
- The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is responsible for creating the `_engine` instance. This instance is supposed to be used to check if the values are monotonic increasing.
- The failing test involves creating a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` and then checking if the levels are monotonic. The error occurs when trying to access the `is_monotonic` property of the levels.
- The `_engine` function seems to be returning a `NoneType` object instead of the expected `PeriodEngine` object, leading to the `AttributeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- The issue seems to be with how the `_engine` function is creating and returning the `_engine` instance. It is likely that the weak reference is not being correctly handled, leading to the NoneType object.
- We need to ensure that a proper `PeriodEngine` instance is created and returned from the `_engine` function to avoid the AttributeError.
- To fix this, we should properly handle the weak reference creation and retrieval.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

### Changes Made:
1. Changed `period` to `period()` when calling it to retrieve the original instance from the weak reference.
2. By calling `period()`, we can correctly obtain the original instance from the weak reference and ensure that a proper `PeriodEngine` instance is returned from the `_engine` function.

By making these changes, the corrected version of the `_engine` function should now return a valid `PeriodEngine` instance, resolving the `AttributeError` issue in the failing test.
