### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is within the `PeriodIndex` class, which is a subclass of `DatetimeIndexOpsMixin` and `Int64Index`.
2. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` with a `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, suggesting that there is an issue with the `PeriodEngine` instance being `None`.
3. The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` and then passing it to `_engine_type` to avoid reference cycle. However, it seems that the weak reference is not correctly being assigned to the `period` variable and the `PeriodEngine` instance is not being properly created, leading to the error.
4. A strategy to fix this issue would be to ensure that the weak reference is correctly stored and retrieved when needed to create the `PeriodEngine` instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By updating `period` to `period()`, we are calling the weak reference and retrieving the actual object it references (`self`) when creating the `PeriodEngine` instance. This should fix the issue with the `PeriodEngine` instance being `None` and resolve the `AttributeError` encountered during the test.
