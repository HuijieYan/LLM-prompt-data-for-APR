### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is defined within the `PeriodIndex` class in the file `pandas/core/indexes/period.py`.
2. The error message occurs when trying to access the `view` attribute on a `NoneType` object, which suggests that the `_engine` property might not be returning the expected object.
3. The error specifically mentions `PeriodEngine`, which indicates that the `_engine` function is returning `None` instead of an instance of `PeriodEngine`, causing an attribute error when trying to access `view("i8")`.
   
### Bug Cause:
The `_engine` property is expected to return an instance of `PeriodEngine`, but it is returning `None` instead.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the `_engine` function returns an instance of `PeriodEngine` instead of `None`.
2. Initialize `PeriodEngine` properly within the `_engine` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from pandas.core.arrays.period import PeriodEngine

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return PeriodEngine(period, len(self))
```
