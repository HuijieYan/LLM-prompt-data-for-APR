### Analysis:
1. The `PeriodIndex` class has a `_engine` function defined, which is supposed to return an instance of `_engine_type` initialized with a weak reference to `self`.
2. The error message suggests that the `_engine` function is failing due to an 'AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view''.
3. The issue seems to be related to the `self._engine_type` returning `None`, which results in an AttributeError when trying to call the `view` method on a NoneType object.

### Bug Cause:
The `_engine_type` function is not returning a valid object instance, resulting in `None`. This causes the AttributeError when trying to access the `view` method on a NoneType object.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine_type` function returns a valid object instance instead of `None`. One way to achieve this is by checking if `_engine_type` returns `None` and handle the case appropriately before creating the weak reference.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Check if _engine_type returns None, and handle the case appropriately
    engine_instance = self._engine_type 
    if engine_instance is None:
        raise ValueError("Engine instance is None")
        
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return engine_instance(period, len(self))
``` 

With this fix, we ensure that the `_engine` method will raise an explicit error if `_engine_type` returns `None`, preventing the AttributeError from occurring.
