**Analysis:**
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a cached readonly method within the `PeriodIndex` class. It returns an instance of `_engine_type` class passing a weak reference of `self` and the length of the class instance.
2. The error message is related to the `is_monotonic` property check on the `idx2.levels` which triggers the `is_monotonic_increasing` check that then tries to access `self._engine` leading to an AttributeError due to `self._engine` returning a `NoneType`.

**Bug Cause:**
The bug is caused by the `_engine` function returning a `NoneType` instead of an instance of the `_engine_type` class. This occurs due to the weak reference usage in creating the `period` variable and then passing it to `_engine_type` but not properly handling the weak reference during the function execution.

**Strategy to Fix the Bug:**
To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the weak reference in the `_engine` function to ensure that the `_engine_type` class instance is correctly created without any reference issues. We should use `period()` to retrieve the period object before passing it to `_engine_type`.

**Corrected Code:**
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)()
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By explicitly calling `weakref.ref(self)()` we are dereferencing the weak reference and obtaining the actual object to pass to `_engine_type`, thus ensuring the correct object creation and fixing the bug causing the `NoneType` AttributeError.
