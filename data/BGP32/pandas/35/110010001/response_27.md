1. The buggy function `_engine` is a cached property within the `PeriodIndex` class. It is intended to return an instance of `PeriodEngine` using the `self._engine_type` constructor.

2. The potential error location within the function is the weak reference usage. The function is attempting to create a weak reference to `self` and pass it to the `_engine_type` constructor. However, due to the weak referencing approach used, it might be causing issues with keeping a valid reference to `self`.

3. The bug is likely occurring due to the weak reference creation and usage. When trying to access `view("i8")` on `self`, an `AttributeError` is raised because the reference might have been lost or not maintained correctly during weak reference usage.

4. To fix the bug, we can try to directly pass `self` to `_engine_type` instead of using a weak reference. This can help ensure that a proper reference is maintained, preventing the `AttributeError` when accessing attributes or methods on `self`.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By directly passing `self` to `_engine_type`, we avoid the weak reference issue and ensure that a valid reference to `self` is used in creating the `PeriodEngine` instance.
