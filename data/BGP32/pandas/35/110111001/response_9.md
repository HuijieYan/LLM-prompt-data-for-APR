### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` uses `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, which should be passed to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`.
2. The error message indicates an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` when trying to return `super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter().view("i8")`.
3. This error suggests that there is an issue with `PeriodEngine` being set incorrectly or not being accessible within the `_engine` function, resulting in `NoneType`.
4. The `weakref.ref(self)` operation might not be correctly maintaining the reference to `self`.

### Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that the `PeriodEngine` class is correctly set and accessible within the `PeriodIndex` class.
2. Check if the weak reference to `self` is being properly maintained in the `_engine` function.

### Code Fix
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type()(period, len(self))
```
