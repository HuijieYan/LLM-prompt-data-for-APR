### Fixing the Bug

#### Issue:
The issue in the buggy function `_engine` is that the `_engine_type` method is expecting a weak reference object, but instead, it is receiving a regular reference to the `PeriodIndex` object.

#### Solution:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly pass a weak reference to the `_engine_type` method. This can be achieved by changing `period = weakref.ref(self)` to `period = weakref.ref(self)`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By making this change, the bug in the `_engine` function should be fixed. This fix will ensure that the `_engine_type` method receives a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object, preventing the reference cycle issue.

After applying this fix, re-run the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` to ensure that it passes without any errors.
