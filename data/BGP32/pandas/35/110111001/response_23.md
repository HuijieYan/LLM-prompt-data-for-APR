### Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The weakref usage might not be correctly handling the reference to self.
2. The return statement with `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` could be causing the issue.

### Explanation of the bug
The bug arises when trying to access the `_engine` attribute of the `PeriodIndex` instance. The failing test is trying to check if the values in the index are monotonic, but an AttributeError occurs within the `_engine` attribute. The error points to an issue with a `NoneType` object not having the `view` attribute.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine` attribute returns a valid object that has the necessary methods and attributes for the `is_monotonic` check. This may involve adjusting how the `_engine` is created and handled within the `PeriodIndex` class.

### Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period_ref(), len(self)) if period_ref() is not None else None
```

In the corrected version, we first create a weak reference to `self` and then use that reference to check if it's `None` before creating the `_engine` object. This should prevent the `NoneType` attribute error when trying to access the `_engine`.
