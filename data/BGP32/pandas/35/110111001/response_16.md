### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class is causing an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` when trying to access an attribute that does not exist. This error occurs when trying to access the `view` attribute from an object of type `NoneType` which indicates that the `_engine_type` is returning `None`.

### Bug Location
The issue lies in the `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))` line where the `_engine_type` method is expected to return an object, but it returns `None` causing the subsequent error.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, ensure that the `_engine_type` method in the `PeriodIndex` class returns a valid object instead of `None`.

### Corrected Function
```python
# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type_result = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine_type_result is not None:
        return engine_type_result
``` 

By checking if the result of `_engine_type` is not `None`, we prevent the `AttributeError` from occurring by returning a valid object.
