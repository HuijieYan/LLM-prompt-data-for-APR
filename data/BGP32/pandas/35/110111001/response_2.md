### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref` incorrectly. It should be creating a weak reference to `self` to avoid reference cycles.
2. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` related to a `NoneType` object not having the attribute 'view'. This error is likely caused by the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref` in the `_engine` function.
3. The failing test is trying to check if the level values of a `MultiIndex` are monotonic, and it fails due to the incorrectly implemented `_engine` function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to properly handle weak references in the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period_weakref, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, we ensure that reference cycles are avoided and prevent the `NoneType` attribute error observed in the failing test. This fix should allow the failing test to pass successfully.
