### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to avoid a reference cycle when creating the `_engine_type` object. However, the usage of `weakref.ref(self)` seems incorrect as it is not capturing the intended reference.
2. The error message indicates an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, suggesting that the `_engine` attribute is returning `None` instead of the expected engine object.
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is checking if all levels in the `idx2` object have monotonic values, but due to the incorrect `_engine` implementation, it leads to the `AttributeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the `weakref` is used to capture the reference to `self` correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the `_engine` function to correctly capture the reference to `self` using `weakref`, giving the correct object when accessed.
2. Ensure that the `_engine_type` object is properly created with the reference to `self`.
3. Update the `weakref` usage in the `_engine` function to return the `self` object.

### Corrected Buggy Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Correctly use weakref to avoid reference cycle
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

With this correction, the `_engine` function should capture the `PeriodIndex` object correctly, and the failing test should pass without the `AttributeError`.
