### Explanation
The `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error occurs because the `_engine` function is returning `None` instead of an instance of the `_engine_type`. This leads to the subsequent attribute error when trying to call `view("i8")` on a `NoneType` object.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that the `_engine` function returns an instance of the `_engine_type` instead of `None`.
2. Update the implementation of the `_engine` function to correctly create and return the `_engine_type` instance.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if self._engine_type is not None else None
```

By checking if `self._engine_type` is not `None` before returning, we prevent returning `None` and ensure that an instance of `_engine_type` is returned. This corrected version should resolve the issue and the failing test should pass.
