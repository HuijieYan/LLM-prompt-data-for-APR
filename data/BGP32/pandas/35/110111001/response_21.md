### Analysis
The main issue in the buggy function lies in the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class. The method is using `self._engine_type` to initialize a new object, but it seems like the `period` argument passed to `_engine_type` is not correctly handled in the underlying implementation of `_engine_type`. This leads to an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute on a `NoneType` object.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the weak reference creation and usage in the `_engine` method. The `period` is created as a weak reference to `self`, but not correctly handled in the subsequent usage inside `_engine_type`. This results in an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute on a `NoneType` object, as `self` is not correctly passed.

### Proposed Fix
To fix the bug, you can modify the `_engine` method to correctly pass `self` without creating a weak reference. This can be achieved by directly passing `self` without using `weakref.ref(self)`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` method:
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By directly passing `self` to `_engine_type`, you ensure that the correct reference is passed and used within the engine type implementation.

This fix should resolve the `AttributeError` issue when accessing the `view` attribute on the `NoneType` object.
