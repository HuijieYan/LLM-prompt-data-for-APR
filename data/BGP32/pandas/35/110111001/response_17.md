### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a cached readonly function that returns an `_engine_type` object based on `self` and the length of `self`.
2. The error occurs when trying to access an attribute from `self._engine` which turns out to be a `NoneType` object.
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` involves creating a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` and then checking if the levels are monotonic, where the error arises.
4. The bug seems to originate from the caching mechanism in the `_engine` function possibly not being set correctly.

### Bug Cause
The `_engine` function is not correctly setting the cached `_engine_type` object, resulting in a `NoneType` object being returned, leading to the attribute access error in the failing test.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine_type` object is properly cached and returned by the `_engine` function.

### Corrected Code
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    if self._engine_cache is None:
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        self._engine_cache = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return self._engine_cache
```

In the corrected version, we check if the `_engine_cache` is None. If it is, we create the `_engine_type` object and store it in the cache. Subsequent calls to `_engine` will return the cached `_engine_type` object.
