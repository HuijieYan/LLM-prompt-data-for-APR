### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to store a weak reference of the `self` object, but the returned value is not being handled appropriately leading to the `AttributeError`.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` using a `PeriodIndex` object and then calls `.is_monotonic` on the resulting `MultiIndex` object, which eventually calls `self._engine.is_monotonic_increasing`. However, due to the bug in the `_engine` function, the returned value is `None`, causing the AttributeError.
   
### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the `_engine` function is not returning a valid engine object but rather a weak reference that gets stored in `period`. As a result, when `_engine` is accessed later in the code, it tries to call methods on a `NoneType`.

### Fix Strategy
1. Instead of storing a weak reference in `period`, we should store a reference to the `self._engine_type` instance directly.
2. Update the `_engine` function to return the `self._engine_type` object directly.

### Updated Corrected Version
```python
# Updated Corrected Version of the `_engine` function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
``` 

By making this change, the `_engine` function will now return the `self._engine_type` instance directly, fixing the bug.
