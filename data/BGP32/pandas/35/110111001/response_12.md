### Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is supposed to return an instance of `_engine_type` using a weak reference to `self`. However, the function is defining a weak reference to `self`, but not using it properly when creating the instance of `_engine_type`. This leads to an error when trying to access attributes of `self`.

### Potential error locations
1. Improper use of weak reference `period` when creating the `_engine_type` instance.

### Cause of the bug
The bug occurs because the `period` weak reference is not properly used to reference `self`, leading to a `NoneType` object error when trying to access attributes of `self` during runtime.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
Ensure the weak reference `period` is correctly passed when creating the `_engine_type` instance to avoid the `NoneType` object error.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `period()` is called to retrieve the actual `self` object from the weak reference, resolving the issue with the original implementation.
