The bug in the provided code is related to the `_engine` method in the `PeriodIndex` class. The function is returning `None` instead of the expected engine instance, leading to an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute.

### Bug Explanation:
- The `_engine` method is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object (PeriodIndex instance) and then returning the engine type with the weak reference and the length of the PeriodIndex.
- The weak reference created from `weakref.ref(self)` is not properly utilized to retrieve the original `self` object inside the `_engine_type` function, resulting in `None` being passed as the period parameter.
- Due to `None` being passed to the `_engine_type` function, the engine instance is not properly initialized, leading to an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is correctly converted back to the original `self` object before passing it to the `_engine_type` constructor.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` instead of just `period` when passing it to the `_engine_type` constructor, we retrieve the original `self` object from the weak reference before passing it, ensuring the engine instance is properly initialized.
