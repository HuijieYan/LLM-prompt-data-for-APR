### Proposed Fix:

The error message indicates that an AttributeError is raised because a 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'. This suggests that the `_engine` function is returning a None value instead of an instance of the PeriodEngine class.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `_engine` function correctly returns an instance of the PeriodEngine class by updating the return statement to instantiate the PeriodEngine class properly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```

By using `weakref.ref(self)` directly in the instantiation of the PeriodEngine class, we ensure that a valid reference is passed, avoiding the NoneType issue observed in the failing test cases. This correction should address the AttributeError and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
