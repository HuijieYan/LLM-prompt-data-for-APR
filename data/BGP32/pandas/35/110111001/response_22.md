### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using a `@cache_readonly` decorator to cache a weak reference to `self` and return an instance of `_engine_type`. 
2. The error message indicates an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, which suggests that the `_engine_type` is not being properly instantiated or accessed, leading to `NoneType` for the `_engine`.
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is checking for monotonicity, and the error occurs when trying to access the `is_monotonic_increasing` attribute of the `_engine` instance.
4. The incorrect return of `NoneType` for `_engine` suggests that the `_engine_type` constructor is not properly returning an instance.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `_engine_type` correctly creates an instance and returns it, resolving the `NoneType` issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check the implementation of `_engine_type` to ensure it is creating an instance correctly.
2. Make sure that `_engine_type` returns an instance of the correct type to `_engine`.
3. Modify the `_engine` function to handle the instance correctly and avoid returning `NoneType`.

### Corrected Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_instance = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine_instance is None:
        raise ValueError("Failed to create engine instance")
    return engine_instance
```
