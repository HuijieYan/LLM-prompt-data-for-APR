### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is the `PeriodIndex` instance.
2. The issue is that the weak reference `period` is not being correctly passed to `_engine_type` due to a missing reference to the original object.
3. This results in an `AttributeError` when trying to access the view attribute on a `NoneType` object, causing the failing test.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is maintained correctly.

### Fix
```python
# Updated buggy function with fixed weak reference usage
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))  # Pass the original object, not the weak reference
```

By passing `period()` instead of `period` to `_engine_type`, we correctly pass the original object accessed through the weak reference. This fix should resolve the `AttributeError` issue and make the failing test pass.
