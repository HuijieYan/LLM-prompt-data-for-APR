### Analysis:
1. The function `_engine` is using a `weakref` to create a weak reference to `self` (a `PeriodIndex` object) and then tries to return an instance of `self._engine_type` by passing the weak reference and the length of `self`.
2. The error message indicates that `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, suggesting that the `super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter()` is returning `None`, leading to an AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute.

### Bug Cause:
The `_engine_type` is not getting the correct instance due to the weak reference usage. The weak reference is not properly resolved, leading to the `NoneType` error.

### Fix Strategy:
Instead of using a weak reference, directly pass `self` while creating the engine instance to avoid the weak reference-related issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
