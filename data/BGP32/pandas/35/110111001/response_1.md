### Explanation of the bug
The bug occurs in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The function is intended to return the `_engine_type` object with a weak reference to the `self` object. However, due to the incorrect implementation, it is currently returning a `NoneType` object when trying to access the `view` attribute.

The failing test, `test_get_level_values_when_periods`, creates a `MultiIndex` object from a `PeriodIndex` object and then checks if all levels of the resulting `idx2` object are monotonic. This test fails because the `_engine` function in `PeriodIndex` returns `None` instead of the expected `_engine_type` object.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should correctly return the `_engine_type` object with a weak reference to `self`.

### Corrected Version of the `_engine` Function
```python
# The corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) 
```

By implementing this corrected version of the `_engine` function, the bug should be fixed, and the failing test should pass successfully.
