### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is trying to create an instance of `self._engine_type` with a weak reference to `self`, but it seems to be failing due to a NoneType error.
2. The error message indicates that the issue is related to a NoneType not having the `view` attribute. This could be occurring when attempting to access a functionality of a None object.
3. The failing test is checking whether the level values of `idx2` are monotonic, and this relies on the correct behavior of the `_engine` function.
   
### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `_engine` function returning a NoneType object instead of the expected `PeriodEngine` object, leading to the `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.

### Fix Strategy
Ensure that the `_engine` function correctly creates an instance of `PeriodEngine` and returns it instead of a NoneType object.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type should not return None")
    return engine
```
