### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is supposed to create an `_engine` object by passing a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`. However, the implementation is incorrect, leading to an `AttributeError` when trying to access an attribute of a `NoneType` object.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` containing a `PeriodIndex` object and then tries to access the `is_monotonic` property, which ultimately calls the incorrect `_engine` function in `PeriodIndex`, causing the test to fail.
3. The bug occurs because the `_engine` function returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, where `period` is a weak reference that is not properly handled.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correctly pass the weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type` and handle the weak reference appropriately.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Use `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object in the `_engine` function.
2. Retrieve the actual object from the weak reference using `.()`, then pass it to `_engine_type`.
3. Add error handling to check if the weak reference is None before accessing its attributes.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    period = period_ref()
    if period is None:
        raise RuntimeError("Weak reference to PeriodIndex object is None.")
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
