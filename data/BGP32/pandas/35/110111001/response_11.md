### Analysis
The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is causing the error by returning a `NoneType` object instead of the expected `PeriodEngine`. This results in an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute on the `NoneType` object.

The problem is likely in the `_engine` function where the creation of the `_engine_type` object may be failing to return an instance of `PeriodEngine`. This leads to the `NoneType` object being returned instead of a valid `PeriodEngine`.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine` function correctly creates and returns an instance of `PeriodEngine` instead of a `NoneType` object.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        raise RuntimeError("_engine_type failed to create a valid engine")
    return engine
``` 

By including a check after creating the `_engine_type` object, we can verify that it is correctly instantiated before returning it. This fix will ensure that a valid `PeriodEngine` object is always returned from the `_engine` function.
