### Explanation of the bug
In the provided function `_engine(self)`, the line `period = weakref.ref(self)` is intended to create a weak reference to the `self` object. However, this line declares `period` as a weak reference, but it does not prevent the original object (`self`) from being garbage collected. As a result, when the `_engine_type` is called later in the function, `self` might have been deleted since only a weak reference to it was stored in `period`.

The error message `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` occurs because the `_engine_type` function tries to access an attribute of `self`, which is already garbage collected.

### Fixing the bug
To fix this bug, `period = weakref.ref(self)` needs to be modified to store a strong reference to `self` to avoid premature garbage collection. One way to do this is by modifying the line to `period = self`.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def _engine(self):
    # To have a proper reference, assign self directly to period.
    period = self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
