### Explanation
The `PeriodIndex` class has an attribute `_engine` that is implemented as a cached read-only property. The `_engine` property returns an instance of a class `PeriodEngine` with a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object. The bug is in the implementation of the `_engine` property, where the weak reference is incorrectly created, leading to an AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute.

The error occurs when the `is_monotonic_increasing` property is accessed in the `IndexEngine` class, which in turn tries to access the `is_monotonic_increasing` property of the `_engine` attribute. This chain of operations leads to the AttributeError because the `_engine` attribute returns a `NoneType` object instead of a valid type.

### Bug Fix Strategy
The bug can be fixed by correctly creating the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object in the `_engine` property.

### The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return PeriodEngine(period(), len(self))
```
