### Potential Error Location
The error is likely occurring in the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is likely caused because the `Weakref.ref` creates a weak reference, which might not be correctly handling the reference to `self` in this context. This leads to an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute on a `NoneType` object.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we should modify how the reference to `self` is handled within the `_engine` function. It seems that the weak reference usage might not be providing the desired behavior.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

### Updated Version:
In the corrected version of the `_engine` function, we directly pass `self` to the `_engine_type` constructor, rather than using a weak reference. This should provide the correct reference to the `PeriodIndex` object and avoid the `AttributeError` that was occurring.
