### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance `self` and then passing it to `self._engine_type`, which is expected to return an engine object.
2. The failing test is trying to access the `is_monotonic` attribute of the engine object within the `levels` of the MultiIndex constructed from the PeriodIndex, but it encounters an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.
3. The error seems to be related to the engine object not being properly initialized or returned as expected from the `_engine_type` function.
4. The bug is likely due to an issue in the construction or handling of the engine object within the `_engine` function.
5. To fix the bug, the `_engine` function needs to correctly create and return the engine object without any issues.



### Fix
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_obj = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine_obj is None:
        raise ValueError("Unable to create engine object")
    return engine_obj
``` 

By adding a check for `None` when creating the engine object, the corrected version ensures that a valid engine object is returned. This should address the `AttributeError` encountered in the failing test.
