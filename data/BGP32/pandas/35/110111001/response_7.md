### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class is causing an `AttributeError` when the test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is executed. The error occurs when trying to access the `view` attribute on a `NoneType` object, leading to the failure of the test.

The key issue lies in the return value of the `_engine` function, which is initialized incorrectly due to weak referencing `self`. This incorrect initialization causes the `_engine_type` constructor to receive `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex` instance.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine` function returns a proper reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance, allowing the `_engine_type` constructor to operate correctly. We can achieve this by reassigning the weak reference after creating the `PeriodIndex` instance, so that the reference passed to `_engine_type` is valid.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a strong reference to self to avoid weak reference issues
    period = self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By updating the `_engine` function as shown above, the issue with weak referencing `self` and the subsequent `AttributeError` should be resolved.
