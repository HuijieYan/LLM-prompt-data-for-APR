### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object (`PeriodIndex` instance). 
2. The function then returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is checking if all levels of `idx2` are monotonic, but it fails when accessing `x.is_monotonic` due to an `AttributeError`.
4. The error message indicates `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, suggesting that the `PeriodEngine` object (`self._engine`) might be `None`.
5. This issue might be related to the use of `weakref.ref` and how the `_engine` method is handling the weakly referenced `self`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. To fix the bug, ensure that `_engine` method correctly handles the weak reference to `self` and creates the `_engine_type` object without any issues.
2. Verify that the returned `self._engine_type` is a valid object and not `None`.
3. Address any potential issues with the weak reference usage that might lead to `NoneType` errors.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
 @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
        if engine is not None:
            return engine
        else:
            raise ValueError("Engine creation failed. Ensure _engine_type setup is correct.")
