### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` incorrectly by passing `self` to it.
2. The `weakref.ref` function should be called on the instance of the object, not on the object itself.

### Bug Cause
The bug is due to passing `self` directly to `weakref.ref` instead of passing an instance of the object.

### Fix Strategy
Pass `self` reference as an argument to `_engine_type` after creating a weak reference to it.

### Corrected Code
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
