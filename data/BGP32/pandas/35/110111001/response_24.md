### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is trying to create an instance of `_engine_type` by passing a weak reference to the `self` object, which is a `PeriodIndex`.
2. The error message indicates that there is an issue with accessing an attribute (`view`) on a `NoneType` object, which suggests that `self._engine_type` might not be properly initialized.
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` involves creating a `MultiIndex` with a `PeriodIndex` as one of its levels, which triggers the use of `_engine` method in `PeriodIndex`.
4. The issue arises because the `_engine_type` object is not properly initialized, leading to a `NoneType` object in the `_engine` method.
5. To fix the bug, the initialization of `_engine_type` needs to be revised to ensure that it is properly instantiated and returned by the `_engine` method.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that `_engine_type` is correctly initialized within the `PeriodIndex` class. Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` method:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` with parentheses, we create a new reference to the `self` object, ensuring that a proper reference is passed to `_engine_type`. This should resolve the issue with the `AttributeError` and allow the test to pass successfully.
