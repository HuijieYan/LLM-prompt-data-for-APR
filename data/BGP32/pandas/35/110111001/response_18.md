### Analysis
The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`. This is done to avoid reference cycles. However, in the failing test, when trying to access `x.is_monotonic` for every level in `idx2.levels`, the code fails with an `AttributeError` due to a `NoneType` object not having the attribute `view`.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused because the weak reference created using `weakref.ref(self)` returns a callable proxy object of `self` and not the actual `self` object. This results in `self._engine_type` being called with a weak reference instead of the actual object, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Solution Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to properly extract the target object from the weak reference proxy before using it.

### Updated function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Get the actual object from the weak reference proxy
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we ensure that the weak reference returns the target object directly instead of a callable proxy object. This change resolves the issue and allows the engine to be initialized correctly.
