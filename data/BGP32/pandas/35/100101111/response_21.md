## Analysis
The `_engine` function is using weak references incorrectly. It is supposed to pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`, but it is creating a weak reference to `self` and then passing that weak reference to `_engine_type`, which causes the issue.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of weak references in the `_engine` function. By creating a weak reference to `self` and passing that weak reference instead of `self` itself, the `PeriodEngine` receives a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

## Fix Strategy
Instead of creating a weak reference to `self` and passing it to `_engine_type`, directly pass `self` to `_engine_type`.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
