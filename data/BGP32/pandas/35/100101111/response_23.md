### Analysis:
1. The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference of `self` (a `PeriodIndex`) before passing it to `_engine_type`. This weak reference mechanism is causing issues with the weak referencing of `PeriodIndex`, leading to errors.
2. The root cause of the problem is that the weak reference mechanism is not correctly handling the `PeriodIndex` object which is causing the engine type to receive `None` instead of the actual `PeriodIndex`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to eliminate the weak reference mechanism in the `_engine` function. By directly passing `self` to `_engine_type`, we can ensure that the `PeriodIndex` object is correctly referenced. 

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
``` 

This corrected version removes the weak reference usage and directly passes `self` to `_engine_type`. This change should resolve the issues related to weak referencing of `PeriodIndex` objects.
