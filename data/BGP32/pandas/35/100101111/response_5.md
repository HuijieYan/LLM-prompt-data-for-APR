## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is utilizing `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is a `PeriodIndex` object. However, the bug lies in the fact that `weakref.ref` returns a weak reference object, not the object itself. This poses a problem when passing this weak reference object to `self._engine_type`, which expects the actual `PeriodIndex` object.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the `_engine` function is returning a weak reference object instead of the actual `PeriodIndex` object. This leads to issues when `self._engine_type` expects a `PeriodIndex` but receives a weak reference object instead, causing unexpected behavior and test failures.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to return the original `PeriodIndex` object instead of a weak reference object. This can be achieved by calling the weak reference object (`period`) to retrieve the original object. 

## Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

By replacing `period` with `period()`, we can retrieve the actual `PeriodIndex` object from the weak reference and pass it correctly to `self._engine_type`. This correction should resolve the issue and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
