## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref()` to create a weak reference of `self` and passing it to `_engine_type` along with the length of the `self`.
2. The failing test involves creating a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` and then checking if the levels are monotonic. The failing test is related to weak referencing issues as described in the GitHub issue.
3. The bug is related to weak referencing. The weak reference of `self` is being created, but it might get dropped before intended, causing `_engine_type` to receive `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` remains valid throughout the function's execution.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the weak referencing issue, we can store the weak reference to `self` in a variable within the function scope to ensure its validity. By doing so, we can prevent premature dropping of the weak reference.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_weakref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference in the `period_weakref` variable within the function scope, we ensure that the weak reference remains valid until it is used by `_engine_type`.
