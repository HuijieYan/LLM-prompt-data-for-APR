## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` on `self`, which creates a weak reference to prevent a reference cycle. However, the issue arises because the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped prematurely, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This behavior is causing the failing test in `test_get_level_values_when_periods`.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by premature dropping of the weak reference to `self` in the `_engine` function. This results in passing `None` to `_engine_type` instead of the `PeriodIndex`, leading to the failing test.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` remains valid until it serves its purpose within `_engine_type`. This can be achieved by either creating a local variable that holds a strong reference to `self` or extending the scope of `period` to prevent it from being garbage collected prematurely.

## The corrected version of the function
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a local variable to hold a strong reference to self
    self_reference = self
    period = weakref.ref(self_reference)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By creating a local variable `self_reference`, we ensure that a strong reference to `self` is maintained until the weak reference `period` has served its purpose within `_engine_type`. This correction should resolve the premature dropping of the weak reference and successfully pass the failing test.
