Based on the provided information, the bug in the `_engine` function is related to the weak reference usage not being correctly implemented. The weak reference should be used to avoid a reference cycle, but it seems like the weak reference is not being properly passed to the `_engine_type` function.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is correctly created and passed to the `_engine_type` function. Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
from pandas.util._decorators import cache_readonly
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Correctly create weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Pass the weak reference to _engine_type
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By modifying the function to call `period()` to retrieve the object from the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the weak reference is properly utilized.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test case provided.
