## Analyzing the buggy function and the failing test:

### Error in the buggy function:

The `_engine` function is meant to return the engine type of the PeriodIndex. However, in its current state, it creates a weak reference to `self` but then immediately passes it to `_engine_type` along with `len(self)`. This weak reference approach seems incorrect as it doesn't ensure the self reference in `_engine_type` is actually being used as intended.

### Error in the failing test:
The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is trying to verify the monotonicity of level values in a MultiIndex that involves PeriodIndex operations.

### Runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function:
Based on the provided information, the input parameter `self` in the buggy function is a `PeriodIndex` containing ['2019Q1', '2019Q2']. The `period` inside the function is created as a weak reference to `self`.

### Expected values and types of variables during the failing test execution:
The expected values at the return of the function include `self._values` with specific period values and `self` remaining as the original `PeriodIndex`.

## Bug Cause and Fix Strategy:

The buggy function `_engine` incorrectly handles creating a weak reference to `self` and passing it to `_engine_type`. To fix this, we can directly pass `self` without involving weak references.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Remove the weak reference creation in the `_engine` function.
2. Directly pass `self` to `_engine_type` along with `len(self)`.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By making the above correction, the function `test_get_level_values_when_periods` should now execute successfully and validate the monotonicity of level values in a MultiIndex involving PeriodIndex operations. The correction aligns the function with the expected behavior, resolving the bug and addressing the GitHub issue mentioned.
