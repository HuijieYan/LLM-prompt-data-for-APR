## Analyzation
The `_engine` function is utilizing weak references to avoid reference cycles, but it seems that the weak reference is not being properly maintained leading to the PeriodEngine receiving `None` instead of the intended PeriodIndex. This issue is reflected in the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods`.

## Bug Cause
The weak reference created with `weakref.ref(self)` might not be maintained properly due to the way it is used in the `_engine` function. This could result in the weak reference being lost and the engine receiving `None`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the weak reference is properly maintained and not lost during the function execution. One way to do this is by storing the weak reference in a variable that has a broader scope within the `_engine` function.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weak_period, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference in a variable `weak_period` within the `_engine` function scope, we ensure that the reference is maintained throughout the function execution, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
