## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file is attempting to handle weak references to avoid reference cycles. However, it seems that the implementation is not correctly passing the weak reference of `self` to the `_engine_type`. This leads to the `_engine_type` receiving a `None` value instead of the `PeriodIndex` object, causing the test to fail.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `period = weakref.ref(self)` line, which creates a weak reference object but does not properly pass it to the `_engine_type`. This results in the `_engine_type` receiving `None` instead of the actual `PeriodIndex` object.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference object `period` is properly used when calling the `_engine_type` function.

## The corrected version of the `_engine` function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Pass a weak reference of self to _engine_type.
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_weakref, len(self))
``` 

By updating the `_engine` function to pass the `period_weakref` weak reference object to `_engine_type`, the bug should be fixed, and the test should pass successfully.
