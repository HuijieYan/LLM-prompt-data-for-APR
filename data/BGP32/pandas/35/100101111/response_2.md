## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `period.py` file is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is a `PeriodIndex` object. The intention is to avoid a reference cycle.
2. The bug occurs because the `weakref.ref(self)` method creates a weak reference that is not being properly utilized in `_engine_type`.
3. This bug is related to an issue on GitHub where copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` loses weakrefs, leading to unexpected behavior and errors.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference created by `weakref.ref(self)` is properly utilized in the `_engine_type` function to avoid losing the weak reference.
5. We need to modify the `_engine` function to correctly handle the weak reference.

## Bug Fix
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weak_period, len(self))
```

In this fix, we have stored the weak reference created by `weakref.ref(self)` in a variable `weak_period` and passed this weak reference to the `_engine_type` function to ensure that the weak reference is not lost. This modification should address the issue and ensure that the weak reference is maintained as intended.
