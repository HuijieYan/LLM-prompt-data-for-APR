## Analysis
1. The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self` but not properly handling it, leading to the reference being dropped before intended.
2. The `weakref.ref` should be stored in a variable to maintain the reference properly.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by not storing the weak reference created by `weakref.ref` in a variable. As a result, the reference is immediately dropped, leading the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to store the weak reference created by `weakref.ref` in a variable and pass that variable to the `_engine_type` constructor.

## Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference in a variable to maintain the reference
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_weakref, len(self))
```
