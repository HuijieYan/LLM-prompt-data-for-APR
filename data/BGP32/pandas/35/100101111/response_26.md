## Analysis
- The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is a `PeriodIndex` object.
- The function then returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, which uses the weak reference to create a new object.
- The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` exhibits an issue related to copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` leading to weak reference loss.

### Error Location
The weak reference created in `_engine` causes the weak reference loss issue when dealing with `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`.

### Cause of the Bug
The weak reference created in `_engine` is not being used correctly, leading to the loss of the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` when copied during the operations in `test_get_level_values_when_periods`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained during copy operations on `MultiIndex`.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self), original=self)
```

By passing the original `self` object explicitly to `_engine_type`, the weak reference is maintained during operations that involve copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`. This correction should resolve the weak reference loss issue reported in the GitHub issue.
