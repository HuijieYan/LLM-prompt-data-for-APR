## Bug Analysis

The buggy function `_engine()` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is a `PeriodIndex` object. The purpose of creating a weak reference is to avoid reference cycles. However, there seems to be an issue with passing this weak reference to `_engine_type()`.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods()` aims to verify if `PeriodIndex` levels are monotonic after certain operations. The failure indicates that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped prematurely, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

## Bug Explanation

The cause of the bug lies in the premature dropping of the weak reference to `self` (`PeriodIndex`) before it is passed to `_engine_type()`. As a result, the engine receives `None` instead of the actual `PeriodIndex` object, leading to unexpected behavior and test failures.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` (`PeriodIndex`) remains valid until it is used by `_engine_type()`. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference in a variable that has a longer lifetime and ensuring that it is accessible when creating the `PeriodEngine` instance.

## Corrected Version

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we store the weak reference in a variable named `period_ref` to ensure its availability until it is passed to `_engine_type()`. This change should resolve the premature dropping of the weak reference issue, ensuring that the `PeriodEngine` receives the actual `PeriodIndex` object and allowing the test to pass successfully.
