### Analysis
The `_engine` function is supposed to return an instance of `self._engine_type`, passing a weak reference of `self` to avoid a reference cycle. However, the use of `weakref.ref(self)` is incorrect, as it creates a weak reference object instead of properly passing a weak reference to the `_engine_type` constructor. This causes the `_engine_type` function to receive `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`, leading to the failing test.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by passing a weak reference object instead of a weak reference to the `_engine_type` constructor in the `_engine` function. As a result, the `_engine_type` function receives `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`, causing the test to fail.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to pass a weak reference to the `_engine_type` constructor instead of creating a weak reference object. This ensures that the `_engine_type` function receives the correct reference to the `PeriodIndex`.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Pass a weakref of self to _engine_type to avoid a reference cycle.
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```
