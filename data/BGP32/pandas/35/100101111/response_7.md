The issue in the buggy function `_engine` is that it is creating a weak reference `period` to `self`, but the weak reference is not being handled correctly causing it to return `None` at times. To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is properly handled and used to create the engine.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    weak_self = period()
    if weak_self is not None:
        return self._engine_type(weak_self, len(self))
    return None
```

This correction ensures that the weak reference is checked before using it to create the engine, avoiding the issue of `None` being returned unexpectedly.

With this correction, the function should now properly handle the weak reference and create the engine as intended, addressing the bug described in the GitHub issue.
