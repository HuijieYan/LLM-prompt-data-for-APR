## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is utilizing a weak reference to `self` but not correctly passing it to `_engine_type`. This leads to a situation where the weak reference is lost before it is supposed to be used, resulting in unexpected behavior.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the weak reference `period` not being passed correctly to `_engine_type`. As a result, when `_engine_type` tries to use the weak reference, it receives `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex` object.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the weak reference should be correctly passed to `_engine_type` to ensure that it receives the `PeriodIndex` object. This can be achieved by dereferencing the weak reference before calling `_engine_type`.

## The Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Dereference the weak reference before passing it to _engine_type
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By dereferencing `period` using `period()`, we ensure that `_engine_type` receives the actual `PeriodIndex` object rather than `None`. This fix should resolve the issue and allow the test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` to pass successfully.
