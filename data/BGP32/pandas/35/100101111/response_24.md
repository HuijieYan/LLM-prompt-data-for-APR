### Analysis
The issue seems to stem from the weak reference `period` not being properly passed to `_engine_type`. This results in the engine receiving a `None` instead of a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex`. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is correctly maintained and used within the `_engine` function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Correctly create and maintain a weak reference to `self` using `weakref.ref`.
2. Pass the weak reference object to `_engine_type` instead of just `self`.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Pass the weak reference to _engine_type
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By correctly using a weak reference to `self` and passing it to `_engine_type`, the bug should be fixed, and the test should now pass as expected.
