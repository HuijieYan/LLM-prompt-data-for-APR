## Analysis
The `_engine` function is intended to return the engine type based on the current PeriodIndex. However, the bug lies in how the weak reference to `self` (the PeriodIndex) is being created and passed to `_engine_type`, resulting in a reference cycle issue. This bug is causing the function to return incorrect values. The failing test is related to weak references being lost, which aligns with the GitHub issue description.

## Potential Error Location
The issue seems to arise from the creation and handling of the weak reference to the `self` PeriodIndex. The use of `weakref.ref(self)` may not correctly maintain the reference, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Explanation of the Bug
The weak reference to `self` (PeriodIndex) created using `weakref.ref(self)` does not maintain the reference properly, resulting in the reference cycle being broken, and `None` getting passed instead of the original reference to the engine type. This causes the incorrect return value and the failure of the test due to lost weakrefs.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly set up and maintained. Proper handling of weak references will prevent the reference cycle problem. We can achieve this by using a weak reference proxy instead of directly using `weakref.ref(self)`.

## The Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use weakref.proxy to get a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we create a weak reference proxy to `self`, ensuring that the reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained and avoiding reference cycle issues. This corrected version should resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue and pass the failing test.
