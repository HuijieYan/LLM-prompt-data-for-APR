Based on the provided information, the bug in the `_engine` function is caused by passing a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`, but the weak reference is not being correctly used. This results in the `period` variable being assigned as a weak reference object (weakref.ref), rather than an actual reference to `self`.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `_engine` function to properly use the weak reference object to obtain a reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.proxy(self)  # Obtain an actual reference using weak reference
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this modification, the `_engine` function should now correctly pass a reference to `self` using the weak reference object, resolving the bug mentioned in the provided GitHub issue.
