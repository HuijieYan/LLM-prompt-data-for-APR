### Analysis
The `_engine` function is expected to return an instance of the `_engine_type` class using a weak reference of the `self` object. However, there is a bug where it is passing `period` (a weak reference to `self`) to the `_engine_type` class constructor instead of the actual object referenced by the weak reference.

### Error Location
The bug lies in passing the weak reference `period` to the `_engine_type` class constructor instead of the actual object referenced by the weak reference.

### Bug Cause
The bug causes the `_engine_type` constructor to receive a weak reference object instead of the expected `self`, resulting in unexpected behavior when `_engine_type` accesses properties of `self`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to dereference the weak reference object `period` before passing it to the `_engine_type` class constructor.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Dereference the weak reference to get the actual object
    period = weakref.proxy(self)

    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we ensure that the actual object is passed to the `_engine_type` constructor, resolving the issue with weak reference handling.
