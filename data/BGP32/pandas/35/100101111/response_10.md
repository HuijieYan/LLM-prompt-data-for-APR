## Bug Fix Analysis:

1. **Issue in the Buggy Function:**
   - The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`. This approach may result in the weakly referenced object being dropped prematurely.

2. **Cause of the Bug:**
   - When calling `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, the weakly referenced `period` might get garbage collected before being used in `_engine_type`.

3. **Bug Fix Strategy:**
   - Instead of using `weakref.ref`, we can directly pass `self` while making sure the reference is maintained until `_engine_type` completes its operation.

4. **Code Fix - Updated Version of the Buggy Function:**

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By directly passing `self` instead of creating a weak reference, we ensure that the reference is retained throughout the function call.

This fix should resolve the premature dropping of the weakly referenced object and address the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
