### Analysis
The buggy `_engine` function is trying to create a weak reference to the `self` object (a `PeriodIndex`) and then pass it to the `_engine_type` function along with the length of the `PeriodIndex`. The issue seems to be related to the weak reference creation.

### Potential Error Locations
1. The weak reference creation might not be done correctly.
2. Passing the weak reference to the `_engine_type` function might not work as expected.

### Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect creation of the weak reference. Due to this issue, when `_engine_type` tries to access the weakly referenced `period`, it might get `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Ensure that the weak reference to the `self` object is correctly created.
2. Verify that the weak reference is being passed correctly to the `_engine_type` function.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Correctly create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we use `period()` instead of `period` when passing it to `_engine_type`. This change ensures that the weakly referenced `self` object is correctly accessed within the `_engine_type` function. This correction should resolve the bug and make the failing test pass.
