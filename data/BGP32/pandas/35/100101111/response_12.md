## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`, but it is not being used correctly when passing it to `_engine_type`. This leads to losing the reference to `self` prematurely, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`, causing the failing test.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the weak reference created using `weakref.ref` is not being preserved correctly when passing to `_engine_type`. As a result, the weak reference is lost before it is intended to be used, leading to incorrect behavior.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the weak reference must be preserved until it is used inside `_engine_type`. Ensure that the weak reference `period` is kept alive until the point where it is accessed within `_engine_type`.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In this corrected version, `period()` is used to access the weakly referenced object before passing it to `_engine_type`. This ensures that the weak reference is still valid when needed inside `_engine_type`.
