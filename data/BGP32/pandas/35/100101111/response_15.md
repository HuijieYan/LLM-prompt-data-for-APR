## Bug Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is a `PeriodIndex` object. The intention is to avoid reference cycles.
2. The bug occurs because the weak reference `period` is not being properly utilized, leading to potential reference leak issues when the `self` object is consumed by `_engine_type`.
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` aims to check if the levels in the `MultiIndex` object created from a `PeriodIndex` object are monotonic but fails due to the weak referencing issue.
4. To fix the bug, the weak reference `period` should be dereferenced correctly before passing it to `_engine_type`.

## Bug Fix
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By invoking `weakref.ref(self)()` instead of storing it in `period` and then passing that to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the weak reference is properly dereferenced before being used. This fix should resolve the reference leak issue and allow the test case to pass successfully.
