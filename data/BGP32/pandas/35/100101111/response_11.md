Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test, it seems that the issue arises from the weak referencing of the `PeriodIndex` in the `_engine` function. The weak reference is not maintained properly, leading to a `None` being passed to the `PeriodEngine` constructor. This causes unexpected behavior and the failing test.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is correctly maintained throughout the `_engine` function. We can achieve this by modifying the `_engine` function as follows:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Fix the weak referencing to maintain the reference throughout the function
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref(), len(self))
```

By correcting the weak reference handling in the `_engine` function, we ensure that the `PeriodIndex` reference is maintained properly for the duration of the function execution, addressing the issue described in the GitHub bug report.

This corrected version should pass the failing test provided for the `test_get_level_values_when_periods` function.
