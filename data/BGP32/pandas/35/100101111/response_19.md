## Analysis
1. The `cache_readonly` decorator suggests that the `_engine` function is meant to be cached and read-only, which means it should return the same value for subsequent calls.
2. The `_engine` function is creating a weak reference to `self` and passing it to `_engine_type`, likely to avoid reference cycles.
3. In the failing test, an issue arises when calling `all(x.is_monotonic for x in idx2.levels)`, indicating a problem with the copied `PeriodIndex` losing weakrefs.
4. The bug seems to stem from the weak reference to `self` not being passed correctly or maintained in the `_engine` function.
   
## Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the weak reference (`period`) is not being used correctly. The `weakref.ref(self)` creates a weak reference to `self`, but since it's not being used in `_engine_type`, the reference is lost, causing subsequent issues.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained throughout the `_engine` function and correctly passed to `_engine_type`.

## Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `period()` is called to get the referenced object from the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`. This ensures that `self` is correctly passed with the weak reference intact. This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and make the failing test pass.
