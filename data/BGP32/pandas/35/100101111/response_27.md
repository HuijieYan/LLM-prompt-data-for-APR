## Fixing the Bug

The issue seems to stem from the weak referencing of the `PeriodIndex` instance not being implemented correctly within the `_engine` function. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is being properly maintained throughout the function execution.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# correct the weak reference implementation
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version above, the weak reference `period` is being properly resolved by calling it using `()` after `period`.

By implementing the correction as shown above, the issue related to weak referencing of `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` should be resolved.
The corrected version should now pass the failing test indicated in the GitHub issue and satisfy the expected input/output values listed.
