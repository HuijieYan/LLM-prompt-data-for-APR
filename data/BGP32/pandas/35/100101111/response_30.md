## Fixing the Bug

### Issue Analysis
The bug originates from the function `_engine` not properly handling the weak reference to `self`. This results in the `period` variable not being correctly utilized when creating the `_engine_type`, leading to unexpected behavior in the test case.

### Bug Cause
The `_engine` function is intended to create an instance of `_engine_type` with a weak reference to the `self` object, but due to incorrect handling of the weak reference, it leads to the failure of the test case.

### Proposed Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is properly utilized when creating the `_engine_type`. By accessing the weak reference `period` properly, the function can correctly pass the `self` object to `_engine_type` without causing any reference cycle.

### Updated Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By modifying the function to access the weak reference `period` with the `()` operator to return the referenced object, we ensure that the correct `self` object is passed to `_engine_type`. This correction will enable the function to operate as intended and resolve the issue identified in the failing test case.
