## Analysis
The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref` incorrectly by passing `self` directly, which creates a weak reference to `self`. However, the weak reference is not being properly maintained, leading to the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before intended. This behavior is causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`, resulting in test failures as the weak reference is lost.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the improper usage of `weakref.ref` in the `_engine` function. The weak reference to `self` is not being maintained correctly, leading to unexpected behavior when accessed in the `PeriodEngine`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, `weakref.ref` should be applied ensuring that the weak reference is properly maintained throughout the function execution. This will prevent the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` from being dropped prematurely and resolve the test failures.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the possible corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

By modifying the `_engine` function to invoke `period()` when returning the result from `_engine_type`, the correct reference to `self` will be maintained throughout the function. This change should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure the function behaves as expected in the failing test case.
