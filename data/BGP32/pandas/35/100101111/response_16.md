## Analysis
The buggy `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object (which is a `PeriodIndex`), and then passing that weak reference to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`. However, the issue arises because the weak reference is not maintained correctly and is being lost before reaching `_engine_type`, resulting in a `None` being passed instead of the original `PeriodIndex`.

The failing test is trying to create a `MultiIndex` from the periods in a `PeriodIndex`, but due to the weak reference issue, it results in errors.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the weak reference `period` being created but not maintained throughout the process, leading to it becoming `None` by the time it's used in `_engine_type`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly maintained until it's used in `_engine_type`. One way to achieve this is to store the weak reference outside of the function to prevent it from being garbage collected prematurely. Then, pass the actual `PeriodIndex` object to `_engine_type` instead of relying on a weak reference.

## Bug-fixed Function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference outside the function
    self._weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Pass the actual PeriodIndex and length to _engine_type
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
``` 

By storing the weak reference as `self._weak_period` within the `PeriodIndex` object, it ensures that the weak reference remains valid until it's used in `_engine_type`.
