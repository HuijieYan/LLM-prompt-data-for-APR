## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is a `@cache_readonly` decorated method within the `PeriodIndex` class. This method returns an instance of `_engine_type`, passing a weak reference of `self` and the length of `self` as arguments.

## Bug Location
The bug is likely within the line `period = weakref.ref(self)`, as `weakref.ref` creates a weak reference to the `self` object. Due to this weak reference, the object `period` may not persist long enough for its reference to be used in `_engine_type`.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is likely causing the weak reference (`period` in `_engine`) to be garbage collected prematurely. As a result, when `_engine_type` is called with `period` as an argument, it's pointing to a non-existent weak reference object, leading to a failure.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we can store the weak reference of `self` in a class variable (e.g., `self._period_weakref`). By storing the weak reference in a class variable, we ensure that it will persist as long as the `PeriodIndex` instance exists, preventing premature garbage collection.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference in a class variable
    self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```
