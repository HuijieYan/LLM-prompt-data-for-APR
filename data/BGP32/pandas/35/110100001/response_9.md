### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` method in the `PeriodIndex` class.
2. The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object (an instance of `PeriodIndex`) and pass it to `_engine_type`.
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` involves creating a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` where `PeriodIndex._engine` is used indirectly, and it checks for monotonicity of the levels.
4. The bug might be caused by the weak reference to `self` in the `_engine` function, which could lead to unexpected behavior when `_engine` is being used in the context of the failing test.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by creating a weak reference to `self` inside the `_engine` function. When the weak reference is passed to `_engine_type`, unexpected behavior may occur due to the reference being weak and the object being collected prematurely.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the weak reference to `self` should be avoided in the `_engine` function to prevent premature collection of the object.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    # Corrected version of the _engine function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By directly passing `self` instead of creating a weak reference to it, we ensure that the `self` object remains valid throughout the `_engine` function execution. This corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
