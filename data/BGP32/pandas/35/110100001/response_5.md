### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` decorator method within the `PeriodIndex` class.
2. The `PeriodIndex` class extends `DatetimeIndexOpsMixin` and `Int64Index`, and it inherits certain attributes and methods.
3. The `_engine` function creates a weak reference to the `self` instance of the `PeriodIndex` class and then returns an instance of `_engine_type` with the weak reference and the length of the `PeriodIndex`.
4. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex`, utilizes the `idx._get_level_values(level)` method during the creation of another `MultiIndex`, and then checks if the levels are monotonic.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `_engine` function creating a weak reference `period` to the `self` instance of the `PeriodIndex`, but not using it correctly when creating the `_engine_type` instance. This results in a weak reference not being properly utilized, causing unexpected behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the weak reference is being used within the `_engine` function. It is important to dereference the weak reference properly before passing it to `_engine_type` to ensure that the intended object is being referenced correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Dereference the weak reference 'period' to get the original object
        period = weakref.ref(self)()
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

After making the above correction in the `_engine` function, the issue with the weak reference should be resolved, and the corrected function should now properly create the `_engine_type` instance. This should allow the failing test to pass successfully.
