### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`. The intention is to avoid creating a reference cycle. However, it seems that the usage of `weakref.ref` might be incorrect, causing issues in the code execution.

### Potential Errors
1. Incorrect usage of `weakref.ref(self)`.
2. Possible reference cycle due to incorrect handling of `self`.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug might be causing the reference to `self` to become weak unexpectedly, leading to unexpected behavior in the `_engine_type`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
Instead of creating a weak reference to `self`, a more direct approach may be needed to pass `self` to `_engine_type`. This can be achieved by directly passing `self` without using `weakref`.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By directly passing `self` to `_engine_type`, we avoid the complexity and potential issues associated with weak references in this context.

This corrected version is more straightforward and should prevent the bug from occurring.
