## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using the `weakref` module to create a weak reference to itself (`period = weakref.ref(self)`) before passing it to `_engine_type`. The purpose of creating a weak reference is to avoid circular references. However, the bug is in the way the weak reference is being used, which is causing the function to fail.

## Identifying potential error locations
The potential error location in the buggy function is how the weak reference `period` is being used. It should be passed as an argument to `_engine_type`, but it is not being used correctly in the return statement.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by incorrect usage of the weak reference `period` created in the `_engine` function. The weak reference needs to be dereferenced before passing it to `_engine_type`, but the code is passing the weak reference object itself, which is causing the function to fail.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, dereference the weak reference `period` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This can be done by calling `period()` to get the actual reference object before passing it to the constructor of `_engine_type`.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

By making this change, the corrected `_engine` function will pass the actual reference object to `_engine_type`, resolving the bug. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
