### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a method of the `PeriodIndex` class. It uses the `cache_readonly` decorator to cache the result of the `_engine_type` function.
2. The purpose of the `_engine` function is to create an instance of the `_engine_type` class with a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance.
3. The bug is likely related to the weak reference usage in the `_engine` function causing unexpected behavior in the caching mechanism.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to how the weak reference `period` is being used within the `_engine` function. When the weak reference is passed to `_engine_type`, it might not hold a strong reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance causing unexpected behavior during caching.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that a strong reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance is maintained when passing it to the `_engine_type`. One approach could be to store a strong reference to `self` in the `_engine` method before creating the weak reference, ensuring that the `self` object is not garbage collected prematurely.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def _engine(self):
        # Ensure a strong reference to self is maintained
        period = self
        # Pass the strong reference to _engine_type
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

After making these changes, the corrected `_engine` function should maintain a strong reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance, preventing unexpected behavior in the caching mechanism.
