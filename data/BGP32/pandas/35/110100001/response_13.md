## Analysis:
- The `PeriodIndex` class contains a `_engine` function that is supposed to return an instance of `_engine_type`. 
- The `weakref.ref` function is incorrectly used, as it should be passed the object to be weakly referenced, not the weakly referenced object itself.
- The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is checking the monotonicity of levels in an Index constructed from a `PeriodIndex` object.
- The bug is likely causing issues in creating the `idx2` Index from the `idx` Index, leading to the failure of the test.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by passing a weak reference object of `self` to the `_engine_type` instead of passing `self` directly. This results in a weak reference being used where the actual object is expected, leading to incorrect behavior.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to pass `self` directly to `_engine_type` instead of creating a weak reference to `self`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Pass self directly to _engine_type instead of creating a weak reference
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
``` 

By making this change, the corrected version of the `_engine` function should now behave correctly and pass the failing test.
