### Analysis:
1. The `PeriodIndex` class inherits from `DatetimeIndexOpsMixin` and `Int64Index`.
2. The `_engine` function is decorated with `@cache_readonly`, which should cache the result of the function.
3. The `_engine` function creates a weak reference to itself and then calls `_engine_type` with the weak reference and the length of `self`.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_engine` function lies in the way the weak reference to `self` is created. Since weak references are inherently weak, they don't prevent the object they reference from being garbage collected. In this case, when `period = weakref.ref(self)` is called, `period` is set as a weak reference to `self`. But then `self` is immediately used in the `_engine_type` call without strengthening the reference, potentially leading to `self` being garbage collected before `_engine_type` is executed.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self` remains available when `_engine_type` is called. One way to achieve this is to store a strong reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This can be done by replacing `weakref.ref(self)` with `self`.

### Corrected Version:
```python

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Creating a strong reference to self
        period = self
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
```

By using `self` directly instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we create a strong reference to `self` and ensure that it is not garbage collected before passing it to `_engine_type`. This corrected version should fix the bug and pass the failing test.
