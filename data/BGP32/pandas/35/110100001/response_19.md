### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` and then passing it to `_engine_type` to avoid a reference cycle. However, the bug is that `self` is not being properly dereferenced when calling `weakref.ref(self)`, which leads to an incorrect behavior in the `_engine` function.

### Bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref(self)`. This creates a weak reference to `self`, but the actual reference is not obtained or dereferenced properly.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly dereference the weak reference created by `weakref.ref(self)` before passing it to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version
```python
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        weak_period = weakref.ref(self)()
        return self._engine_type(weak_period, len(self))
```

With this corrected version, the weak reference is dereferenced properly and then passed to `_engine_type`, resolving the bug.
