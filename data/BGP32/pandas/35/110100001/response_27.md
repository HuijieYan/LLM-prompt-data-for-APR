### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `@cache_readonly` method in the `PeriodIndex` class.
2. The function is designed to return an instance of `_engine_type` with a weak reference to `self` and the length of `self`.
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is related to `PeriodIndex` and involves creating a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex`.
4. The bug seems to be related to the usage of weak references and potentially causing issues in the test function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of weak references in the `_engine` method. When the `self` reference is weakly referenced using `weakref.ref(self)`, the weak reference is not automatically dereferenced. This can lead to unexpected behavior when the weak reference is passed to `_engine_type`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the weak reference is explicitly dereferenced before passing it to `_engine_type`. This will ensure that the reference to `self` is properly maintained and prevent reference cycle issues.

### Corrected Version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By dereferencing the weak reference `weakref.ref(self)()`, we ensure that the `self` reference is retrieved before passing it to `_engine_type`.

This corrected version should address the bug and make the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` pass successfully.
