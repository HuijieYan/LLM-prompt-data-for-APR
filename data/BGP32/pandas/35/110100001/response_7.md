## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` function that is supposed to return an instance of `_engine_type` by passing a weak reference of `self` (an instance of `PeriodIndex`) and the length of `self`. The purpose of using a weak reference is to avoid creating a reference cycle, which is a memory management issue.

## Error Location
The bug is likely in the way the weak reference is created and passed to `_engine_type`.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the `weakref.ref` method is being called incorrectly. Instead of passing `self` directly to `weakref.ref`, the instance of `self` should be passed. This causes `period` to be a weak reference to the `weakref.ref` object itself, instead of a weak reference to `self`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to change the way the weak reference is created. We should pass `self` (the instance of `PeriodIndex`) to `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`.

## The corrected version of the `_engine` function
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

By passing `self` to `weakref.ref` as `period()`, we are effectively creating a weak reference to the instance of `PeriodIndex`. This should fix the bug and allow the function to work correctly.
