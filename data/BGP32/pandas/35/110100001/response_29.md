## Analysis
1. The `PeriodIndex` class contains a `_engine` function that is decorated with `@cache_readonly`.
2. Inside the `_engine` function, it creates a weak reference to `self` and then calls `_engine_type` with the weak reference and the length of `self`.

## Bug and Cause
The bug in the `_engine` function is that it is creating a weak reference to `self` but not using the weak reference while calling `_engine_type`. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors, as `_engine_type` may not receive the actual `PeriodIndex` instance.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we should provide the actual `PeriodIndex` instance to `_engine_type` using the weak reference. This can be achieved by dereferencing the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`.

## Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
