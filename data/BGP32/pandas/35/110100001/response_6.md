### Analysis:
1. The `PeriodIndex` class has a `_engine` function that is a `@cache_readonly` property.
2. The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`.
3. The `_engine` function is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.

### Bug:
The bug in the `_engine` function is that it is creating a weak reference to `self` but not properly retrieving the actual object when needed. This can lead to unexpected behavior and errors in the functionality of the `_engine` property.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to properly retrieve the object from the weak reference and then return the `_engine_type` property.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Retrieve the object using the weak reference
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, we can properly retrieve the object from the weak reference and avoid the buggy behavior.
