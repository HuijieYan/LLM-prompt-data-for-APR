### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to the `self` object and passing this weak reference to `_engine_type`. However, the `weakref.ref` function does not return the object itself, but a callable weak reference object that needs to be called to access the actual object.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the `_engine` function is returning the weak reference instead of the actual object. This leads to incorrect behavior when `_engine_type` is called with the weak reference instead of `self`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
We need to modify the `_engine` function to correctly access the actual object from the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` instead of `period`, we can obtain the actual object from the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`. This correction will fix the bug and address the incorrect behavior observed in the failing test.
