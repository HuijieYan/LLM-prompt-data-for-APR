### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is defined within the `PeriodIndex` class. It is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to the `self` object (which is an instance of `PeriodIndex`). The purpose of this weak reference is to avoid creating a reference cycle that could potentially lead to memory leaks.

### Bug
The bug in the `_engine` function is that it is passing the weak reference `period` to `_engine_type` instead of the actual object `self`. This is incorrect because `_engine_type` expects an actual reference to the `self` object, not a weak reference. This results in the `_engine_type` function not being able to access the necessary attributes and methods of the `PeriodIndex` instance.

### Fix
To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should pass `self` directly to `_engine_type` instead of passing the weak reference.

### Corrected Version

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@inherit_names(['strftime', 'to_timestamp', 'asfreq', 'start_time', 'end_time'] + PeriodArray._field_ops, PeriodArray, wrap=True)
@inherit_names(['is_leap_year', 'freq', '_format_native_types'], PeriodArray)
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):

    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
