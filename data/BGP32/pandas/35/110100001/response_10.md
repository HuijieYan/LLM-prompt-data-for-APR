### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` decorator method in the `PeriodIndex` class.
2. The function creates a weak reference `period` to the `self` object and then returns the result of calling `_engine_type` with `period` and the length of `self`.
3. The buggy function is causing an issue in the test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods` related to `PeriodIndex._engine`.
4. The weakref usage in the function `_engine` is incorrect and causing the weak reference `period` to be deleted too early.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the weak reference `period` is created inside the `_engine` method, but it immediately goes out of scope, causing the reference count to drop to zero and the weak reference object to be garbage collected. This results in an error when attempting to access the weak reference later on.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` remains in scope for the duration of its intended usage. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference as an attribute of the `self` object.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference `self._period_ref` as an attribute of the `self` object, we ensure that the weak reference remains in scope for as long as the `PeriodIndex` object exists. This should fix the bug and allow the corrected version to pass the failing test.
