## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is an instance of `PeriodIndex`. This weak reference is then passed to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`. The purpose of using a weak reference here is to avoid creating a reference cycle, which could create memory leaks.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because `weakref.ref(self)` returns a weak reference object, and the `_engine_type` method is expecting the actual instance object. This causes the `_engine_type` method to not get the actual `PeriodIndex` instance but a weak reference instead, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to pass the actual `self` instance to the `_engine_type` method instead of a weak reference to `self`. This can be achieved by directly passing `self` to the `_engine_type` method without creating a weak reference.

## The corrected version of the buggy function

    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
