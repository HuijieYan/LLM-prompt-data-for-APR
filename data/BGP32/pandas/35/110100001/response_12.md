## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` method within the `PeriodIndex` class.
2. The `_engine` function is using `weakref` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is then passed to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`.
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` and then retrieves the level values. The test is checking if the level values are monotonic.
4. The bug seems to be related to the usage of `weakref` within the `_engine` function. The weak reference might not be used correctly, leading to issues with the `PeriodIndex`.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of `weakref`. When creating a weak reference to `self` with `weakref.ref(self)`, it's not being properly stored or accessed later when creating the `_engine_type`.

## Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we can update the `_engine` function to properly create and utilize the weak reference to `self`. One way to solve this is to store the weak reference as an instance attribute to prevent it from being garbage collected, and then dereference it when needed.

## Corrected Version of the `_engine` Function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a weak reference in an instance attribute to prevent it from being garbage collected
    self._weakref_period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._weakref_period, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference as `self._weakref_period`, we ensure that the weak reference remains valid and accessible when creating the `_engine_type`. This correction should address the issue with the weak reference cycle and resolve the bug.
