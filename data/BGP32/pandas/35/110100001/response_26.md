### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` decorator function within the `PeriodIndex` class.
- The function is trying to create a weak reference to the instance of the class using `weakref.ref(self)` and then pass that weak reference to `_engine_type`.

### Identified Issue:
- The issue is that the current implementation of `weakref.ref(self)` is not correctly creating a weak reference to the instance of the class.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref(self)` which is not creating a weak reference as intended. This leads to a failure in creating the weak reference cycle and can cause unexpected behavior when `_engine_type` is called with the weak reference.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, the correct way to create a weak reference to the instance of the class is to use `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`. This will generate a correct weak reference that can be passed to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version of the `_engine` Function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
