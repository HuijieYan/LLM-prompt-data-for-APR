### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `@cache_readonly` decorator in the `PeriodIndex` class.
2. The `_engine` function uses `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to the `self` object (PeriodIndex instance).
3. The `self` object is then passed to `self._engine_type()` along with the length of `self`.
4. The purpose of using a weak reference is to avoid creating a reference cycle that may cause memory leaks.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_engine` function occurs because the weak reference created using `weakref.ref(self)` is not being correctly dereferenced to obtain the original object before passing it to `self._engine_type()`. This results in `self` being passed as a weak reference object, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly dereference the weak reference object before passing it to `self._engine_type()`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Dereference the weak reference to get the original object
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version:
- Instead of directly passing `period` (which is a weak reference object), we pass `period()` which dereferences the weak reference and returns the original object (PeriodIndex instance).
- This ensures that the `_engine_type` is called with the correct object and fixes the bug in the `_engine` function.
