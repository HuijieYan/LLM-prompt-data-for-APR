## Analysis:
1. The `PeriodIndex` class contains a `_engine` function that is decorated with `@cache_readonly`.
2. The `_engine` function is supposed to return a new instance of the `_engine_type` class passing a weak reference of `self` and the length of the `PeriodIndex`.
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` with `PeriodIndex` objects and then accesses the level values, which triggers the `_engine` function.
4. The bug occurs in the `_engine` function where it incorrectly uses `weakref.ref(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance.
5. This incorrect usage leads to a weak reference to the `weakref.ref` object itself instead of the `PeriodIndex` instance, causing unexpected behavior.

## Fix Strategy:
1. The `_engine` function should correctly create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance.
2. Changing `period = weakref.ref(self)` to `period = weakref.ref(self)` should fix the bug and ensure that a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance is passed to the `_engine_type`.

## The corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
