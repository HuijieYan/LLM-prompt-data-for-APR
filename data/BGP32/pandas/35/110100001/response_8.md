### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` function within the `PeriodIndex` class.
2. The `_engine` function is attempting to create an instance of the `_engine_type` class using `weakref.ref(self)` as an argument.
3. The bug is likely due to the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref(self)` as an argument to `_engine_type`.
4. The `weakref.ref(self)` call creates a weak reference to the `self` object, which may cause issues when trying to pass it as an argument to `_engine_type`.
   
### Bug Cause:
The `weakref.ref(self)` is used incorrectly in the `_engine` function. Instead of passing the weak reference itself, the actual object should be passed.

### Fix Strategy:
Modify the `_engine` function to pass `self` directly to the `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
