### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is a method of the `PeriodIndex` class. It tries to create an instance of `_engine_type` by passing a weak reference of `self` object and the length of the index. The intention seems to be preventing a reference cycle by using a weak reference. However, the implementation seems incorrect as it should be passing the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object instead of a regular reference.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_engine` function causes the `weakref.ref` function to return a weak reference object instead of the actual object reference. As a result, when `_engine_type` is called with this weak reference object, it fails to resolve any attribute or method calls on the `PeriodIndex` instance due to the weak reference. This leads to errors and test failures.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the actual `PeriodIndex` instance is passed to `_engine_type` instead of a weak reference object. This can be achieved by dereferencing the weak reference object when calling `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Function:
Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By dereferencing the weak reference object `period`, we get the actual `PeriodIndex` instance and pass it to `_engine_type`. This should resolve the issue and make the function work as intended.
