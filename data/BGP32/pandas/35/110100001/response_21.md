The bug in the provided function `_engine` is due to the way `weakref.ref` is being used to create a weak reference to `self`. The `weakref.ref` function returns a callable weak reference object, not the actual weak reference itself. Therefore, the weak reference needs to be dereferenced using `()`. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to properly create and dereference the weak reference. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By using `period()` to dereference the weak reference, we are passing the actual object reference instead of the callable weak reference object.

This fix should address the bug and make the failing test pass.
