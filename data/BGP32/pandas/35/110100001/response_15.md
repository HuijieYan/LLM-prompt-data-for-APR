### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a cached readonly method within the `PeriodIndex` class.
2. The function is trying to create a weak reference to `self` (instance of `PeriodIndex`) and pass it to `_engine_type`.
3. The purpose of creating a weak reference is to avoid a reference cycle that could lead to memory leaks.
4. The bug arises because the weak reference `period` is not being properly utilized when creating the `_engine_type` object.
5. This bug is causing issues in the test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods` as it indirectly involves the `_engine` method.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused due to the incorrect handling of the weak reference `period` in the `_engine` function. The weak reference is created but not used when instantiating the `_engine_type`, leading to unexpected behavior in the code.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly utilize the weak reference `period` when creating the `_engine_type` object. We should dereference the weak reference using `period()` before passing it to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

By dereferencing the weak reference `period` using `period()` before passing it to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the actual instance of `self` is used correctly without causing reference cycle issues. This fix should resolve the bug and make the test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods` pass successfully.
