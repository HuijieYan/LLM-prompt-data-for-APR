### Analysis
The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref` incorrectly by creating a weak reference to `self` without keeping a strong reference. This leads to the weak reference being garbage collected before being used, resulting in a `NoneType` object being returned. This is causing an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute on the `NoneType` object.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we should keep a strong reference to `self` while creating the weak reference. This can be achieved by assigning the weak reference to a variable outside of the function scope, preventing it from being garbage collected.

### Corrected Code
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Keep a strong reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    self.period_ref = period
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By saving the weak reference in a `self.period_ref` attribute, the strong reference will be maintained, preventing the garbage collection issue. This should fix the bug and prevent the `NoneType` object error.
