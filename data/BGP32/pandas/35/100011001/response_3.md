### Cause of the bug
The bug in the `_engine` function is causing an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute of a `NoneType` object. The function is returning `None` instead of the expected value, which is causing the error downstream when trying to access attributes on this `None` object.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weakref is correctly used to avoid the reference cycle and return the `_engine_type` object instead of `None`.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` instead of just `period`, we are correctly obtaining the weak reference object's underlying object, which allows the `_engine_type` function to operate as expected and return a valid engine object instead of `None`.
