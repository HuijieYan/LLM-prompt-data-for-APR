### Explanation
The error message indicates that an `AttributeError` is raised with the message `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`. This error occurs when the `super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter()` returns `None` instead of an object with the `view` attribute, which leads to the attribute error when trying to access `view("i8")`.

### Bug Location
The bug is likely in the `_engine(self)` function where `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` is expected to return a valid `PeriodEngine` object, but it is returning `None`.

### Cause of the Bug
The `weakref.ref(self)` is being assigned to `period`, but it is not being used correctly to create the `PeriodEngine` object. This causes the returned value of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` to be `None`, leading to the `AttributeError` later on.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is actually used to create the desired object. We should use `period()` to access the original `self` object from the weak reference. By doing this, we can prevent the reference cycle issue and ensure that the correct `PeriodEngine` object is returned.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

By making this change, the function will correctly create the `PeriodEngine` object and prevent the `AttributeError` from occurring in the tests.
