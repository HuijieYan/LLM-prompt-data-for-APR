### Explain the bug
The bug is likely caused by the `_engine` function not properly setting up the weak reference to `self`. This results in `period` being a weak reference to `self` that is not correctly passed to `_engine_type`, leading to an `AttributeError` when trying to access `view('i8')` on a `NoneType` object.

### Fix strategy
To fix this bug, ensure that the weak reference `period` is correctly created and passed to `_engine_type` to avoid the AttributeError. 

### The corrected version of the function
Below is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Correctly create a weak reference to avoid reference cycles
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

### Summary
The corrected version ensures that the weak reference `period` is correctly passed as a callable object to `_engine_type` by using the `period()` call. This fix should resolve the `AttributeError` issue encountered in the failing test case.
