### Potential Error Locations
1. The use of `weakref.ref(self)` might not be correctly referencing `self`.
2. There could be an issue with how `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` is used.

### Bug Explanation
The error message indicates an AttributeError on `NoneType`, suggesting that there might be a problem with how the `_engine_type` is being used. The issue seems to be related to the returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, where `self._engine_type` might not be correctly instantiated or initialized.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that `period` is correctly referencing `self` using `weakref`.
2. Verify that `self._engine_type` is properly initialized and called within the function.
3. Make sure that the correct methods are used within `_engine_type` to avoid the AttributeError.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
``` 

In the corrected version, `weakref.ref(self)` now correctly references `self`, and we call `self._engine_type(self, len(self))` with `self` directly instead of `period`. This should address the AttributeError issue and ensure the `_engine` function works correctly.
