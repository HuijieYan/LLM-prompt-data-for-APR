### Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided function `_engine` is causing an AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute of a `NoneType` object. This indicates that the `_engine_type` method is returning `None` instead of the expected engine object. The `weakref.ref(self)` call is used to create a weak reference to the `self` object (which is an instance of `PeriodIndex`), but it is not being used correctly to create the engine object.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to correctly create the engine object using the weak reference to the `self` object. This involves utilizing the weak reference properly to access the original `self` object when creating the engine object.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By using `period()` instead of just `period`, we access the original `self` object from the weak reference before passing it to the `_engine_type` method. This should prevent the AttributeError and fix the bug in the function.
