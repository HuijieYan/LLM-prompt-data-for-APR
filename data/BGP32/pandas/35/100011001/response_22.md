### Analysis
- The error message points to an AttributeError with 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'.
- The `_engine` function is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.
- The variable `period` is being assigned `weakref.ref(self)`, which might be causing the issue.
- The incorrect return value from the `_engine` function is likely leading to the 'NoneType' error downstream.

### Bug Cause
- The `weakref.ref(self)` assignment is likely causing an issue where the reference needed is not being maintained properly, leading to a `NoneType` error.

### Strategy for Fixing
- Instead of directly returning the weak reference, retain a strong reference to the object while passing a weak reference to the `_engine_type` function to avoid reference cycles.
- Create a strong reference to `self` outside of the weak reference generation.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a strong reference to avoid NoneType issue
    strong_self = self
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(strong_self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
