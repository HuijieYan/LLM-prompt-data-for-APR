### Explanation
The error message indicates an `AttributeError` related to accessing an attribute that is not available, specifically the `view` attribute on a `NoneType` object. This suggests that the `_engine` function is returning `None` instead of the expected engine object, causing the subsequent error when trying to access its attributes.

Looking at the buggy function, we can see that `period = weakref.ref(self)` creates a weak reference to the `self` object, but it does not actually store it or use it later. This leads to `None` being returned when trying to use `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is properly utilized when creating the engine object to avoid it being garbage collected. 

We can achieve this by modifying the code to first extract the `self` object from the weak reference and then use it to create the engine object. By doing this, we can prevent the weak reference from getting garbage collected prematurely.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Extract the self object from the weak reference
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By making this change, the weak reference `period` is correctly used to create the engine object, ensuring that it is not garbage collected prematurely, and the `AttributeError` should be resolved.
