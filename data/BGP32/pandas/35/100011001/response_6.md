### Analysis
The `_engine` method is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. The error message indicates an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`. This suggests that `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` is returning `None`, leading to an attribute error when trying to access the `.view("i8")` attribute.

### Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by the `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` call returning `None` instead of the expected result.

### Fix Strategy
Ensure that `_engine_type` returns a valid object instead of `None` to prevent the attribute error.

### The corrected function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type returned None")
    
    return engine
``` 

By adding a check for `None` and raising an explicit exception, we prevent the function from returning a `NoneType` object. This should resolve the attribute error seen in the failing test.
