### Explanation
The error message indicates an `AttributeError` related to a `NoneType` object that does not have the `view` attribute. The issue is likely occurring within the `_engine` function where the `PeriodEngine` instance is not being correctly created or initialized, leading to `NoneType` being returned instead of the expected object.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `PeriodEngine` instance is correctly created and returned within the `_engine` function.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine if engine is not None else self._default_indexer()
``` 

By adding a check to ensure that the `engine` is not `None` and returning a default indexer if it is, we can prevent the AttributeError from occurring.
