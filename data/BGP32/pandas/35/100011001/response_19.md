### Analysis
The error message indicates an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, pointing to an issue with the `PeriodEngine` object being returned by the `_engine` function. The runtime values show that the input to the `_engine` function is a `PeriodIndex` object containing two periods ('2019Q1', '2019Q2').

The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object (which is the `PeriodIndex` object). However, the weak reference is not being properly utilized when passing it to `_engine_type`, resulting in a `NoneType` as the return value. This leads to the `AttributeError`.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect use of `weakref.ref(self)` in the `_engine` function. The weak reference should be dereferenced to obtain the object it references before passing it to `_engine_type`.

### Fix Strategy
Modify the `_engine` function to dereference the weak reference obtained using `weakref.ref(self)` before passing it to `_engine_type. This will ensure that the object is properly referenced when creating the `PeriodEngine`.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Dereference the weak reference to obtain the actual object
    period = self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By making this change, the weak reference issue should be resolved, and the corrected function will return the proper `PeriodEngine` object, fixing the `AttributeError` reported in the failing test.
