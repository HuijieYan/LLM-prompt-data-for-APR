### Analysis
The error message indicates an `AttributeError` related to a `NoneType` object not having the attribute `view`. This error is occurring when trying to access the view attribute of the `PeriodEngine` object, which is likely not being properly initialized.

Looking at the buggy function `_engine`, it seems that the issue lies in how the weak reference to `self` is being assigned to `period`. Weak references are used to avoid creating circular references that can prevent objects from being garbage collected, but in this case, it is not being used correctly.

### Bug Cause
The bug causes the `self` reference not being properly maintained in the weak reference. This leads to a `NoneType` object being passed to `_engine_type`, resulting in the attribute error.

### Fix
To fix the issue, the `period` should be assigned correctly as a weak reference to `self`, and then the weak reference should be used to create a weak reference proxy when calling `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
