### Analysis
- The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is a `PeriodIndex`.
- The function then tries to instantiate `_engine_type` using the weak reference `period` and the length of `self`.
- The error message indicates an `AttributeError` on the weak reference `view()`, suggesting that the weak reference might be returning `None`.
- The function should create a weak reference to `self` correctly and ensure that it is not returning `None`.

### Bug
The bug is likely in how the weak reference `period` is being used to instantiate `_engine_type`.

### Fix
Update the function to properly handle the weak reference and provide a corrected version below.

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, the weak reference will point to the actual object rather than the weak reference object itself. This ensures that the weak reference does not return `None` and resolves the `AttributeError` issue.
