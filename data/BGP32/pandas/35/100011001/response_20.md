### Analysis
The `_engine` method is trying to create a weak reference to the `self` object (a `PeriodIndex` instance) and pass it along with the length of the `self` object to the `_engine_type` method. However, the weak reference is not being properly created, leading to an `AttributeError` when accessing the weak reference object.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect way the weak reference is being created using `weakref.ref(self)`. This leads to the weak reference object being of type `weakref` instead of properly referencing the `self` object.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly create the weak reference to the `self` object before passing it to the `_engine_type` method.

### The corrected version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# The corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self to avoid reference cycle
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` after creating the weak reference, we correctly obtain a reference to the original `self` object. This should fix the `AttributeError` occurring in the failing test.
