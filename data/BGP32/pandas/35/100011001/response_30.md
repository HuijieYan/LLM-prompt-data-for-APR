### Analyzing the bug

- The `is_monotonic` property is accessed in the failing test for `MultiIndex` levels.
- The error message points to an issue related to the `PeriodEngine` and the attempt to access a `view` attribute on a `NoneType`.
- The `_engine` function is annotated with a `cache_readonly` decorator to cache the engine instance.
- The returned `_engine` is created with a weak reference to `self`, which might lead to issues with object lifecycle management.
- The error occurs when trying to retrieve a `view` attribute on the engine, indicating that the engine might not have been correctly initialized or is of `NoneType`.

### Bug Fix Strategy

- Ensure that the engine creation method interacts correctly with weak references.
- Confirm that the returned engine is initialized properly before accessing attributes like `view`.
- Debug the engine creation process to identify any issues in initializing the engine instance.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_instance = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    if engine_instance:
        return engine_instance
    else:
        raise ValueError("Engine instance not properly initialized")
```

This corrected version ensures that the `_engine` function returns a valid engine instance by explicitly checking if the instance is not None before returning. This fix addresses the potential issue of the engine not being correctly initialized, helping to prevent attribute access errors like the one seen in the failing test.
