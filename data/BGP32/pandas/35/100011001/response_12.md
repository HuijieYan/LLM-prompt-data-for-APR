### Explanation:
The error message `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` indicates that there is an issue with the `_engine` function returning a `NoneType` object instead of the expected engine type.

Looking at the provided buggy function, we can see that `weakref.ref(self)` is creating a weak reference to `self`, but it's not correctly being used to create the period engine. This results in a `NoneType` object being returned.

### Potential Bug Location:
The issue seems to be with how the weak reference `period` is being passed to `self._engine_type` to create the period engine.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug:
Modify the way the weak reference is utilized in creating the period engine so that it does not result in a `NoneType` object being returned. 

### The corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use the weak reference to avoid reference cycles
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Check if the weak reference is not None before creating the engine
    if period():
        return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
    else:
        raise ValueError("Weak reference expired before creating engine.")
``` 

With this correction, the function first checks if the weak reference exists before creating the period engine, ensuring that a `NoneType` object is not returned.
