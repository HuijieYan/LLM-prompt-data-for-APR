### Analysis
The `_engine` function is attempting to create a weak reference to `self` and then call `_engine_type` with that weak reference and the length of `self`. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` because a `NoneType` object has no attribute `view`. This error likely originates from the way the weak reference is created and used.

### Bug Cause
- The `weakref.ref` function is being used incorrectly. It creates a weak reference object but does not return the original object `self`.
- The `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` call attempts to use the weak reference `period`, resulting in errors due to the weak reference object not having the necessary attribute (`view` in this case).

### Fix Strategy
- Instead of creating a weak reference object directly, obtain the weak reference's referenced object using the `.()` operator.
- Pass the referenced object to `_engine_type` instead of the weak reference object.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

After applying this correction, re-run the failing test to ensure that the issue has been resolved.
