### Bug Explanation
The bug is causing an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` because the `_engine_type` function is returning `None`, which leads to the error when trying to access the `view` attribute on a `NoneType` object.

### Bug Fix
The issue is likely due to the weak reference implementation. To fix the bug, we need to correctly use weak references to avoid reference cycles and ensure that the `_engine_type` function returns a valid object.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is not None:
        return engine
    else:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type function returned None")
``` 

By adding a check for `None` after calling `_engine_type` and raising an error if it returns `None`, we can ensure that a valid object is returned to prevent the `AttributeError` from occurring.
