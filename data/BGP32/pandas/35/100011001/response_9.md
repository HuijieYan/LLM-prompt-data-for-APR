### Bug Analysis
The error message indicates an AttributeError at the line `return super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter().view("i8")` inside the `_engine` function. This error occurs because `self._engine_type` is returning a `NoneType` object instead of the expected engine object.

### Bug Location
The bug is likely in the `_engine_type` method call, where it returns `None` instead of the actual engine object.

### Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is that the `weakref.ref` method is not being correctly utilized in the `_engine` function. The weak reference is not being appropriately dereferenced when used to create the `PeriodEngine`. This results in the `self._engine_type` call returning `None` instead of the expected engine object.

### Suggested Fix
To fix this bug, you need to correctly dereference the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`. This can be achieved by calling the `period` object as a function to get the actual reference to `self`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Correctly dereference the weak reference
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.ref(self)()` instead of just `weakref.ref(self)`, we ensure that the weak reference is properly dereferenced before passing it to `_engine_type`. This should resolve the AttributeError issue and make the function work correctly.
