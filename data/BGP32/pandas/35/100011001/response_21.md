### Potential Error Locations
1. The weakref creation might not capture the reference to `self` correctly.
2. The `_engine_type` might not be initializing properly.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug could be due to the weakref not capturing a reference to `self` correctly, leading to `period` being `None` when `_engine_type` is called. This results in the AttributeError `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
Ensure that the weakref creation correctly captures a reference to `self` and that `_engine_type` is properly initialized.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine_type
``` 

By updating the function to correctly store and return the `_engine_type`, the bug causing the AttributeError should be resolved.
