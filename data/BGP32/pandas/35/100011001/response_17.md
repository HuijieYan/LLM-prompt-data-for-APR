### Analysis
- The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref` incorrectly by creating a weak reference to `self` but not dereferencing it properly.
- The error message indicates an `AttributeError` with `NoneType` object, suggesting that the `_engine_type` method is returning `None` instead of the expected object.
- This can lead to the attribute error when trying to access `view()` method on a `NoneType` object.

### Bug Cause
- The bug is caused by not properly handling the weak reference to `self` when calling `_engine_type`.

### Fix Strategy
- Properly dereference the weak reference obtained from `weakref.ref(self)` before passing it to `_engine_type`.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

By dereferencing the weak reference using `period()` before passing it to `_engine_type`, the corrected version of the function should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
