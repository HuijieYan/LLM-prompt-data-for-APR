### Analysis
The `_engine` function is designed to return an engine type based on the input `self`. It uses a weak reference of `self` to avoid reference cycles. However, the error message indicates an `AttributeError`, specifically `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, which suggests that the `_engine_type` is not being properly initialized or returned.

### Bug Explanation
1. The weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` creates a weak reference object to `self`.
2. The line `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))` is intended to return the engine type based on the weak reference `period` and the length of `self`.
3. The error message `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` suggests that the `_engine_type` is not being properly initialized or returned, resulting in a `NoneType` object being returned instead of the expected engine.

### Bug Fix
To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `_engine_type` is properly initialized and returned within the `_engine` function.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine_type
``` 

This revision ensures that the `engine_type` is explicitly returned after being properly initialized with the weak reference `period` and `len(self)`.
