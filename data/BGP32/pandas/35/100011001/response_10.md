### Potential location of error:
The bug is likely within the `_engine` function where the `self._engine_type` is being called. The error message indicates that `self._engine` is returning a `NoneType` object, causing an `AttributeError`.

### Cause of the bug:
The `_engine` function is creating a weak reference to `self` but is not correctly assigning the weak reference to `period`. This results in `period` being `None` when passed to `self._engine_type`, leading to the `NoneType` error.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Correctly assign the weak reference of `self` to the `period` variable.
2. Ensure that the weak reference is being used properly in the `self._engine_type` call.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# Correction for the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

By correctly calling `period()` to get the referenced object, the weak reference will be properly used when calling `self._engine_type`, fixing the bug causing the `NoneType` error.
