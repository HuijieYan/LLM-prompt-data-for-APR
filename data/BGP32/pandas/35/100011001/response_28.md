### Explanation
The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `PeriodEngine` object's `vgetter()` method returning a `NoneType` object, leading to an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view()` method on it.

### Bug in the code
The bug lies in the implementation of the `_engine` method. The `period` variable is being created as a weak reference to `self`, but it is not being used correctly when calling `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. This incorrect usage of `period` is leading to the `PeriodEngine` object being created incorrectly, eventually causing the `NoneType` object error.

### Fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to use the weak reference correctly and ensure that it is correctly related to the `self` object when creating the `PeriodEngine`.

### Corrected code
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By modifying the return statement to `return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))`, we correctly access the weak reference and pass the original object to the `_engine_type` method. This should resolve the issue with the `NoneType` object error.
