### Bug Explanation
The error message "AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'" is indicating that somewhere in the `_do_monotonic_check` method of the `PeriodEngine` class, a variable that is expected to have a value is actually `None`, leading to the error when trying to access an attribute `view`.

Looking at the buggy function `_engine`, it is likely that the issue lies in the line `period = weakref.ref(self)`. This line creates a weak reference to the `self` object but does not actually store it in a variable that can be accessed later. This could lead to `self` being `None` in certain cases, causing the error.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, it's necessary to properly store the weak reference to `self` so that it can be used later in the function without being susceptible to being garbage collected. One way to do this is to store the weak reference as a variable of the class instance.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Storing the weak reference to self as a class instance variable
    self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
``` 

By storing the weak reference as `self._period_ref`, we ensure that `self` remains accessible and prevents it from being garbage collected prematurely. This should resolve the issue and prevent the `NoneType` error from occurring.
