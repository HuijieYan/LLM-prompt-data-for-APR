### Analysis
The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `NoneType` object having no attribute `view`. This suggests that the `_engine` function is returning `None` instead of the expected `PeriodEngine` object, leading to the error when trying to access the `view` attribute.

### Bug Cause
The `_engine` function is returning `None` instead of the expected `PeriodEngine` object, likely due to the weak reference usage with `weakref.ref(self)`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the weak reference usage should be updated to correctly reference `self` and return the `PeriodEngine` object instead of `None`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By modifying `period()` to invoke the weak reference correctly, we ensure that the actual object `self` is passed to `_engine_type`, resolving the issue of `None` being returned. This fix should resolve the error message and allow the tests to pass successfully.
