### Bug Explanation
The error message indicates that there is an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`. This error occurs when trying to access the `view` attribute on a `NoneType` object, which means that the `_engine_type` is returning `None` instead of the expected engine object.

### Bug Fix Strategy
The issue seems to be with the initialization of the `period` object inside the `_engine` function. The `weakref.ref()` function should be called with the object itself (`self`) to create a weak reference to the object. However, in the buggy code, it is being called with `self`, which creates a weak reference to the object without actually referencing the object itself.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By changing `period` to `period()` when calling the `_engine_type`, we ensure that the weak reference is accessed and passed as the correct object to the `_engine_type` function.
