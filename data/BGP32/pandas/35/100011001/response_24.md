### Analysis
The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`. However, the issue arises because the `period` variable is not properly used. It is supposed to be passed as an argument to `_engine_type`, but currently, it is not being utilized correctly, leading to an AttributeError when trying to access the weak reference.

The error message indicates that a 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view', suggesting that `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` might be returning a NoneType object.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by not properly utilizing the weak reference `period` when passing it to `_engine_type`. This leads to a NoneType object being returned, resulting in the AttributeError.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly pass the weak reference `period` to `_engine_type` so that it can be used as intended.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

By calling `period()` instead of just `period`, we dereference the weak reference and pass the actual object to `_engine_type`. This should resolve the issue and prevent a NoneType object from being returned.
