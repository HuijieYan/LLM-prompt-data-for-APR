### Explanation
The error message `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` indicates that the `_get_index_values()` method is returning `None` instead of the expected index values. This can lead to the subsequent error when trying to access the 'view' attribute of `None`.

The buggy function `_engine` is creating a weak reference to `self`, but it is not being used correctly when calling `_engine_type`. This results in `None` being returned instead of the expected engine type.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly used when calling `_engine_type`. The weak reference should be dereferenced to obtain the actual `self` reference needed for the `_engine_type` call.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

By dereferencing the weak reference using `period()`, we can obtain the actual reference to `self` and pass it to `_engine_type`, fixing the issue with the `NoneType` return value.
