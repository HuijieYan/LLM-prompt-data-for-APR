### Analysis
The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is using a `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to the `self` object. However, this is causing an issue because `weakref.ref` returns a weak reference object, not the actual object, which leads to a problem in the `_engine_type` constructor when it expects the actual object.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by using `weakref.ref(self)` instead of just `self` in the `_engine` function. This causes an issue when trying to pass the weak reference object to the `_engine_type` constructor.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to remove the `weakref.ref` usage and directly pass `self` to the `_engine_type` constructor in the `_engine` function.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By making the above change, the corrected version of the `_engine` function will now properly pass the `self` object to the `_engine_type` constructor, resolving the weak reference issue. This will allow the function to work correctly with the provided test.
