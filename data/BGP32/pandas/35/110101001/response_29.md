### Analyzing the buggy function
The `_engine` function defined in the `PeriodIndex` class is using a `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object (PeriodIndex instance) and pass it to the `_engine_type` constructor. The purpose of using a weak reference is to avoid creating a reference cycle between objects, which might lead to memory leaks.

### Potential error location
The potential error in the `_engine` function is the way the weak reference is being created and passed to the `_engine_type` constructor. Since `weakref.ref()` returns a weak reference object, it should be dereferenced before being passed to `_engine_type`.

### Cause of the bug
The bug in the `_engine` function is that it returns a weak reference object (`period`) instead of the referenced object (dereferenced weak reference). This means that the `_engine_type` constructor is receiving a weak reference object instead of the `self` object, causing unexpected behavior.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to dereference the weak reference object (`period`) before passing it to the `_engine_type` constructor. This can be done by calling the `period()` method on the weak reference object to get the referenced object (`self`).

### Corrected Version of the `_engine` function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

By dereferencing the weak reference object (`period`) using `period()`, we ensure that the `_engine_type` constructor receives the actual `self` object as intended. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
