### Analysis
The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is designed to return an instance of `_engine_type` initialized with a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance and its length. The bug in the current implementation is causing an issue with reference cycle management by using `weakref.ref(self)` incorrectly.

### Bug Explanation
The bug lies in the line `period = weakref.ref(self)` where the weak reference `period` is not stored correctly and therefore doesn't serve the intended purpose of avoiding reference cycles. This can lead to unexpected behavior with memory management and referencing.

### Proposed Fix
To fix this bug, we need to correctly store the weak reference to `self` by calling `weakref.ref(self)` and then accessing the reference when creating the `_engine_type` instance. This will ensure proper reference handling and avoid reference cycles causing unexpected behavior.

### Corrected Version
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```
