### Explanation of the bug
The `_engine` function is using the `weakref` module to create a weak reference to the `self` object before returning an instance of the `_engine_type` class. However, in the buggy code, the weak reference is not being properly created which leads to a potential reference cycle issue and could cause memory leaks.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to correctly create a weak reference to the `self` object before passing it to the `_engine_type` class.

### Corrected version of the `_engine` function
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
