### Analysis
The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is attempting to create a weak reference to itself and then use that reference to create an instance of `_engine_type`. However, the weak reference is being created incorrectly, leading to a reference cycle and causing the function to fail.

### Bug
The bug in the `_engine` function lies in the way the weak reference is being created. Instead of creating a weak reference to the `self` instance of the `PeriodIndex` class, it is currently creating a weak reference to a method `weakref.ref(self)`, resulting in a reference cycle.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to create a weak reference to the `self` instance directly.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
