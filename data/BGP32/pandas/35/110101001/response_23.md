### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using a `weakref` to prevent a reference cycle. However, the use of `weakref.ref(self)` is incorrect as it is creating a weak reference to `self` instead of `PeriodIndex` object. This leads to unexpected behavior in the `_engine_type` method, causing the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` to fail.

### Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref(self)` in the `_engine` function, where it should be using `weakref.ref(self._engine_type)`. This mistake creates a weak reference to `self` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex` object.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly use `weakref.ref(self._engine_type)` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object. This will ensure that the object is not held strongly in memory and prevent the reference cycle issue.

### Corrected Version
```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self._engine_type)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
