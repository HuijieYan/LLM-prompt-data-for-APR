### Case 1 Analysis
- The `self` input parameter is a `PeriodIndex` object with values `['2019Q1', '2019Q2']`, dtype `period[Q-DEC]`, and freq `Q-DEC`.
- The buggy function `_engine` is trying to create a weak reference `period` to the `self` object and then pass it to `_engine_type`.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_engine` function lies in how the `weakref.ref` is being used. In the current implementation, the weak reference `period` is being created within the scope of the function and not attached to any object outside the function, which defeats the purpose of using a weak reference.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to create a weak reference to the `self` object and pass it correctly to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```

By making this change, the weak reference `period` is correctly pointing to the `self` object outside the scope of the `_engine` function, resolving the bug.
