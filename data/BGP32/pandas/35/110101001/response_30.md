### Analysis and Bug Explanation
The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance. However, the issue arises when this weak reference is being passed to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`, which is incorrect. The `weakref.ref(self)` call returns a weak reference object, not the actual object itself. Therefore, passing this weak reference along with the length of `self` is causing the bug.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to obtain the actual object from the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`. We can do this by calling the `self()` method on the weak reference object, which will return the actual object if it has not been garbage collected.

### Corrected Version of the `_engine` Function
```python
# this is the corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Obtain the actual object from the weak reference before passing it to _engine_type
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By using `period()` to retrieve the actual object from the weak reference, we ensure that the correct object is passed to `_engine_type`, resolving the bug. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
