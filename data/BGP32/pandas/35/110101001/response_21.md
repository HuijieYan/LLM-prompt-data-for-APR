### Analyzing the buggy function

The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object (an instance of `PeriodIndex`). The weak reference is then passed on to the `_engine_type` constructor along with the length of the `self` object.

The potential issue here is that the weak reference `period` created with `weakref.ref(self)` might not be retained long enough. This could lead to the weak reference being garbage-collected before it serves its intended purpose, resulting in unexpected behavior.

### Cause of the bug

In the provided test scenario, the `PeriodIndex` object is passed to the `_engine` function. However, the weak reference `period` that is created with `weakref.ref(self)` is not retained beyond the scope of the function. This premature garbage collection of the weak reference can lead to failures when trying to use that weak reference later on.

### Fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the weak reference `period` remains accessible for as long as it is needed. One way to achieve this is by storing the weak reference as a class attribute instead of a local variable within the `_engine` function.

### Corrected version of the `_engine` function

```python
# Corrected _engine function in PeriodIndex class
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference as a class attribute to prevent premature garbage collection
    self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference as a class attribute (`self._period_weakref`), we ensure that the reference remains alive throughout the lifetime of the `PeriodIndex` object. This should prevent any premature garbage collection issues and resolve the bug.
