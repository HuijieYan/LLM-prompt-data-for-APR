### Analysis
The `@cache_readonly` decorator in the `_engine` function suggests that the function is intended to return a cached value without re-calculating it each time it is accessed. The function seems to be trying to create a weak reference to `self` using `weakref.ref(self)`, but the usage is incorrect.

### Error
The issue lies in the line `period = weakref.ref(self)`. The `weakref.ref()` function returns a weak reference object, not the weak reference itself. Therefore, when `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` is called, it is using the weak reference object instead of the original object, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should correctly utilize `weakref.ref()` to create a weak reference object, dereference it when needed before passing it to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version
```python
# Fix the buggy function to correctly create a weak reference

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    period_deref = period()
    return self._engine_type(period_deref, len(self))
```
