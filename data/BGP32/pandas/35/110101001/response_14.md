### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to pass a weak reference of `self` to the `_engine_type` constructor. However, this approach is incorrect as `weakref.ref(self)` returns a weak reference object and not the actual object. This results in passing a weak reference object to `_engine_type` instead of the intended object.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `_engine` function is passing a weak reference object instead of the actual `self` object to the `_engine_type` constructor. This leads to unexpected behavior when `_engine_type` interacts with the passed object, as it's supposed to receive the actual `self` object.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to pass the actual object `self` to the `_engine_type` constructor. We can achieve this by directly passing `self` instead of using `weakref.ref(self)`.

### Corrected Version
```python
# Corrected _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
``` 

By making this change, the `_engine` function will correctly pass the `self` object (actual object) to the `_engine_type` constructor, resolving the bug.
