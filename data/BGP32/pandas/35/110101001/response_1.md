### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is trying to create an instance of `_engine_type` and passing a weak reference of `self` to it. However, the implementation of creating the weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` is not correct.

### Potential Error
The issue seems to be with how the weak reference `period` is being created and used in the `_engine` function.

### Bug Explanation
The buggy function is failing because the weak reference `period` is not being correctly created. The `weakref.ref()` function returns a weak reference object, not the object itself, so when passing `period` to `_engine_type`, it is causing an error.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly create a weak reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
