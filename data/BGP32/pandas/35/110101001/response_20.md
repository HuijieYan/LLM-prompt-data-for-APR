### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_engine` is attempting to create a weak reference to the `self` object, which is an instance of the `PeriodIndex` class. However, the way it is implemented is incorrect. When the weak reference is created using `weakref.ref(self)`, it does not retain a reference to `self`, hence causing `weakref.ref(self)` to be garbage collected too soon. This results in the `_engine_type` function being called with a garbage collected weak reference object, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to properly create a weak reference to the `self` object in a way that prevents it from being garbage collected prematurely. We can achieve this by creating a bound method of `_engine_type` that holds a weak reference to `self` using the `functools.partial` function.

### Corrected Version
```python
import functools

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return functools.partial(self._engine_type, period, len(self))
```

By using `functools.partial` to create a bound method that holds a reference to `self`, we ensure that the reference is not garbage collected prematurely. This corrected version should address the issue and pass the failing test.
