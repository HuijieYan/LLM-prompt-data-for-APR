### Explanation
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is attempting to create a weak reference to the `self` object and pass it to the `_engine_type` method. However, the weak reference is not being used correctly, leading to potential memory leaks and unexpected behaviors.

The `weakref.ref(self)` line in the `_engine` function is creating a weak reference to the `self` object, but it is not being dereferenced to access the original object when passing it to `_engine_type`. This can lead to issues since `_engine_type` might expect a reference to the actual object rather than a weak reference.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this issue, we need to dereference the weak reference object to access the original `self` object before passing it to `_engine_type`. This ensures that `_engine_type` receives the correct object reference.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass the original object to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))  # Dereference weakref to access the original object
```
