### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is defined as a `cache_readonly` function that returns an instance of `_engine_type` with a weak reference to `self` as one of the arguments. However, the weak reference is not being correctly created, which may cause a reference cycle issue.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect creation of a weak reference using `weakref.ref(self)` in the `_engine` function. The weak reference should capture `self`, the instance of `PeriodIndex`, to avoid creating a reference cycle. However, it seems like the weak reference is not effectively capturing `self`, leading to a potential reference cycle issue.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is correctly created to capture `self` without creating a reference cycle. We can modify the `_engine` function to correctly create and return a weak reference to `self`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we call the weak reference `period()` to obtain the actual reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This should prevent any potential reference cycle issues.
