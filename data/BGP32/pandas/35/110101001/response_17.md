### Analysis
The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object. This weak reference is then passed to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self` to create the engine. The issue here is that the `weakref.ref` function is not used correctly in this context.

The purpose of `weakref.ref` is to create a weak reference to an object without preventing it from being garbage-collected. However, in this case, it is being used as if it returns the object itself, which is incorrect. The correct usage would be to create a weak reference and then access the object through that weak reference. Currently, passing `period` to `_engine_type` is passing a weak reference object, not the actual `self` object.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by incorrectly using `weakref.ref(self)` to obtain the object `self` when creating the engine in the `PeriodIndex` class. This incorrect usage leads to passing a weak reference object instead of the actual object to `_engine_type`.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to correctly dereference the object from the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`. The corrected version will involve calling the weak reference object to get the actual `self` object.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Dereference the weak reference to obtain the actual object
    period = self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
