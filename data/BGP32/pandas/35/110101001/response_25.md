### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using the `weakref.ref` incorrectly, which is causing the test to fail. The intent seems to be to pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`, but the implementation is incorrect.

### Bug Cause
- The `weakref.ref()` is used incorrectly, it should return a weak reference object for the `self` instead of calling it directly.

### Fix Strategy
- Modify the `_engine` function to correctly pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type` using `weakref.ref(self)`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
