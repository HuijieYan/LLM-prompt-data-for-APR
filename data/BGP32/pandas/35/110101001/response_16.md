### Analysis
- The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` (which is a `PeriodIndex` object) and passing it to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`.
- The purpose of using `weakref.ref` is to avoid creating a reference cycle.
- However, the issue lies in the fact that `weakref.ref` returns a weak reference object, not the actual object itself.

### Bug
- The bug in the `_engine` function is that it is passing a weak reference object (`period`) to `_engine_type` instead of the actual `self` object.

### Fix
- To fix the bug, we need to dereference the weak reference object to get the actual `self` object before passing it to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Dereference the weak reference object to get the actual 'self'
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
