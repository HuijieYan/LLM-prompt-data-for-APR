### Analysis
The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is attempting to create an instance of `_engine_type` with `weakref` usage to avoid reference cycles. However, the implementation of `period = weakref.ref(self)` is incorrect, as it should actually be `period = weakref.ref(self)()`. This is causing the weak reference to not work correctly and potentially causing memory leaks.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref(self)` where it should be `weakref.ref(self)()` to create a weak reference to the `self` object.

### Fix
Modify the line `period = weakref.ref(self)` to `period = weakref.ref(self)()` to correctly create a weak reference to the `self` object.

### Corrected Version
```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
