### Analysis
1. The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is intended to return an instance of the `_engine_type` class, passing a weak reference of the `self` object and the length of the index as arguments.
2. The current implementation uses `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference of the `self` object, but then incorrectly returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, which is not utilizing the weak reference properly.
3. The bug causes the `_engine` function to return the `self._engine_type` instance instead of properly passing the weak reference and length.
4. To fix the bug, we should use the weak reference properly by calling `period()` on the weak reference object before passing it to the `_engine_type` constructor.

### Bug Fix
```python
# Fix for the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
