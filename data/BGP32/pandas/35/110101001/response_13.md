### Analysis
The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object. However, the return statement is missing a call to retrieve the actual object from the weak reference, leading to a `weakref` object being returned instead of the `self` object.

### Bug Explanation
The bug causes the `_engine` function to return a weak reference object instead of the actual `self` object. This can lead to issues downstream when the `_engine` function is expected to work with the `self` object.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to retrieve the actual object from the weak reference before returning it.

### Corrected Code
```python
# Corrected _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return period()
```
