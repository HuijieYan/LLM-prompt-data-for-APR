### Analysis
- The buggy function `_engine` is using a `cache_readonly` decorator, which suggests that it is trying to cache the result of the function to avoid recalculating it multiple times.
- The function is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, where `period` is a weak reference to `self`.
- The weak reference usage is intended to avoid reference cycles and potential memory leaks.

### Bug
The bug in the function `_engine` is that it's storing a weak reference `period` to `self`, but not accessing the original object using the weak reference later. This means that the `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` call is not using the weak reference properly and can potentially lead to issues related to object lifecycle management and memory.

### Fix
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that we dereference the weak reference `period` before passing it to `self._engine_type`. This can be done by calling `period()` to get the original object. Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By updating the function to dereference the weak reference `period` using `period()`, we can ensure that the intended object is being used correctly.
