### Bug Explanation
The bug is likely occurring because the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is trying to create a weak reference to `self`, but it is not being utilized correctly when instantiating `_engine_type`. This can cause unexpected behavior and may lead to the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy
Ensure that the weak reference `period` is properly utilized when instantiating `_engine_type` to avoid any issues related to reference cycles.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

By calling `period()` when passing it to `_engine_type`, we are dereferencing the weak reference and obtaining the actual `self` object. This should help fix the bug and allow the function to work correctly.
