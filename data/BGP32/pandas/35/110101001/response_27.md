### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is creating a weak reference to `self` and then passing it to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`.
2. The function does not appear to be correctly handling weak references, which may be causing the bug.
3. The failing test is related to `PeriodIndex._engine`, indicating that there might be an issue with creating the `_engine` attribute for `PeriodIndex` instances.
4. To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should properly handle weak references to avoid reference cycles.

### Bug Cause
The bug in the `_engine` function may be due to the improper handling of weak references which may result in reference cycles or incorrect usage of the weak reference object.

### Fix Strategy
Ensure that the weak reference is used appropriately and does not cause reference cycles or incorrect behavior.

### Corrected Version
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weak reference of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

This correction involves calling the weak reference object to get back the original reference before passing it to `_engine_type`. This should help in avoiding reference cycles and potential issues with weak reference usage.
