### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using a weak reference `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object (an instance of `PeriodIndex`). However, the weak reference is not being properly utilized, and this could be causing issues. The function then attempts to return `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, which seems to be trying to instantiate an object of type `self._engine_type` with the weak reference and the length of `self`.

The failing test is related to the `_engine` method being removed and calls `_get_level_values` method on `idx` to create a new `MultiIndex` object. The failing test indicates that the `is_monotonic` property of the levels in the new `idx2` object should be true.

### Bug
The bug appears to be in how the weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` is used and the instantiation of the `_engine_type` object, as it might not be correctly utilizing the weak reference or instantiating the object properly.

### Fix
To fix the bug, the weak reference should be properly utilized and the `_engine_type` object should be instantiated correctly. Since the exact nature of `_engine_type` is not provided, I will assume that it needs a weak reference to the period but does not require the length of the `PeriodIndex` object during instantiation. 

Below is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period)
``` 

By fixing the usage of the weak reference and the instantiation of the `_engine_type`, the corrected version should now pass the failing test.
