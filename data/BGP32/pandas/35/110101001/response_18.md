### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance. The weak reference is then passed to `_engine_type` along with the length of the `PeriodIndex`.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` and then retrieves level values from it. The test ensures that the resulting levels are monotonic.
3. Based on the failing test, the incorrect behavior or bug in the `_engine` function can lead to unexpected results when creating or manipulating the `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex`.
4. The bug could be related to maintaining a weak reference in the `_engine` function, which might not be properly utilized when creating the `MultiIndex`.

### Bug Cause
The bug in the `_engine` function might be related to how the weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` is used or passed to the `_engine_type`. The weak reference might not be properly maintained or utilized, causing unexpected behavior when creating the `MultiIndex`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is properly maintained and utilized in the `_engine` function. We can directly pass the weak reference to the `_engine_type` without unnecessary manipulation.

### Corrected Version
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type directly.
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
``` 

By directly passing the weak reference `weakref.ref(self)` to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the reference is correctly used without any unnecessary manipulation, potentially fixing the bug.
