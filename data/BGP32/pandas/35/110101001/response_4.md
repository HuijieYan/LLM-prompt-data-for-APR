### Analysis
The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object. The intention is to avoid a reference cycle. However, the way it is currently implemented is causing the weak reference to be stored in the `period` variable and not properly utilized.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the weak reference created using `weakref.ref(self)` is stored in the `period` variable but never actually used. This results in the `_engine_type` function being called with incorrect arguments, leading to unexpected behavior and failing tests.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, you need to actually use the weak reference stored in the `period` variable when calling the `_engine_type` function. This involves dereferencing the weak reference to obtain the original object before passing it to `_engine_type`. Additionally, the use of `weakref` implies that the `period` object could have been deallocated by the garbage collector, so you need to handle this situation by checking if the weak reference is still valid.

### Corrected Version
```python
# Corrected _engine function in PeriodIndex class
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    if period() is None:
        raise RuntimeError("Weak reference is no longer valid")
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

By making these changes, the corrected `_engine` function now properly handles the weak reference and ensures that the correct object is passed to the `_engine_type` function. This should address the bug and make the failing test pass.
