### Analysis
1. The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class uses `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object.
2. The weak reference `period` is then passed to the `_engine_type` constructor along with the length of `self`.
3. The weak reference pattern is used here to avoid creating a reference cycle that could prevent the garbage collector from reclaiming memory.
4. However, the `weakref.ref(self)` call is not correctly capturing the `self` object, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.


### Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object. Since the reference returned by `weakref.ref(self)` may not be always "live", it can lead to issues when calling methods on the weak reference object.


### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, instead of creating a weak reference to `self` using `weakref.ref(self)`, the `_engine` function should directly pass `self` to the `_engine_type` constructor. Since there is no need to avoid the reference cycle in this context, using the `self` object directly should resolve the issue.


### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
