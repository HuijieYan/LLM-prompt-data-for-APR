### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates that there is an `AttributeError` in the `PeriodEngine` class, specifically in the `vgetter().view("i8")` line.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` involves creating `MultiIndex` objects from `PeriodIndex` instances and then checking if each level is monotonic.
3. The buggy function `_engine` in `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` is related to creating the engine for `PeriodIndex`.
4. The error occurs when the engine does not return the expected type, leading to an `AttributeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
The issue seems to arise from the engine not correctly returning the expected type. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the engine returns a non-None type before accessing its methods.

### Corrected Code:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# Fixing the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is not None:  # Added check for non-None engine
        return engine
    else:
        raise RuntimeError("Engine creation failed in _engine")

```

By modifying the `_engine` function to include a check for a non-None engine object, we can prevent the `AttributeError` that was occurring. This fix ensures that the engine is properly created before accessing its methods, resolving the issue seen in the failing test.
