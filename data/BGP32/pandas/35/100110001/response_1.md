### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object. This weak reference is then passed to `_engine_type`. The error occurs when trying to access the weak reference.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` includes a `MultiIndex` instance created from a `PeriodIndex` which eventually tries to access the `is_monotonic` property of the index levels, leading to the error.
3. The error message shows that the `_engine` method returns a `NoneType` object leading to an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute.
4. The bug seems to be in the implementation of `_engine` where the `weakref` creation and passing may not be done correctly.
5. To fix the bug, we can ensure that `_engine` returns a proper engine object and does not result in a `NoneType`.

### Bug Fix:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By directly passing `self` to `_engine_type` instead of creating a weak reference and passing it, we ensure that the correct object is passed to `_engine_type`. This fix should address the `AttributeError` related to the `NoneType` object.
