### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`, but it is not being used correctly. The issue is that `weakref.ref(self)` is returning a reference rather than the actual object which is expected by `_engine_type`. This results in the error when trying to use `self` in `_engine_type`.

### Error Cause:
The error occurs because `weakref.ref(self)` returns a weak reference object, not the actual object itself. This leads to incorrect behavior in `_engine_type` resulting in the error message.

### Fix Strategy:
Instead of creating a weak reference object, we need to access the actual object. This can be done by using `self` directly in `_engine_type` without creating a weak reference.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
``` 

By directly passing `self` to `_engine_type` in the corrected version, we ensure that the actual object is used instead of a weak reference, resolving the bug.
