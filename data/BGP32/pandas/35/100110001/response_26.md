### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file is supposed to return an instance of `_engine_type` using a weak reference of `self`.
2. The failing test in `pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py` is testing the monotonicity of index levels by calling `is_monotonic` on each level.
3. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` where a `NoneType` object does not have the attribute `view`.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the `_engine` function not correctly returning an instance of `_engine_type`. This results in the object being of type `None` which causes the `view` attribute error.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should properly create an instance of `_engine_type` and return it instead of returning `None`. This can be achieved by correcting the weak reference creation and instantiation of `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By correcting the weak reference creation with `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, the corrected function should now return the correct instance of `_engine_type` instead of `None`.
