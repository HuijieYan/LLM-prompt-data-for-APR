### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is then passed to `self._engine_type` along with `len(self)`.
- The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is checking for monotonicity of levels in an index created from `PeriodIndex`.
- The error message indicates an `AttributeError` related to `NoneType` object not having the attribute `view`.

### Identified Issue:
- The bug is likely in the implementation of the `_engine_type` method which might be returning `None` instead of a valid object, leading to the `AttributeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Check the implementation of `_engine_type` method to ensure it returns a valid object. It should not return `None`.
- Handle cases where `self._engine_type` could potentially return `None`, and ensure it returns a valid object that contains the required methods and attributes.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine:
        return engine
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid engine type returned from _engine_type")
```

By adding a check for `None` return value from `_engine_type` method and raising a `ValueError` if it occurs, we ensure that the function returns a valid engine object and avoids the `AttributeError` described in the failing test.
