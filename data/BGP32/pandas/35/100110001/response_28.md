### Analysis:
1. The `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error is occurring because the `_engine` function is returning a weak reference that is not being properly handled.
2. The weak reference `period` is created but not being used correctly inside the `_engine` function.
3. The bug is causing the `_engine` function to return `NoneType` instead of the expected engine type, leading to the AttributeError in the failing test.
   
### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Instead of directly returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, we need to properly dereference the weak reference `period` using `period()` before passing it as an argument to `self._engine_type()` to ensure we are passing the actual object instead of its weak reference.
2. Modify the `_engine` function to use the dereferenced `period` object when creating the engine type.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Dereference the weak reference to avoid returning NoneType
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By making this change, the `_engine` function will properly create the engine type object using the dereferenced period object, fixing the bug and allowing the failing test to pass without the AttributeError.
