### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a method defined in the `pandas` library's `PeriodIndex` class. It is decorated with `@cache_readonly`, indicating that it is a cached property.
2. In the failing test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods`, it creates a `MultiIndex` from an array of `PeriodIndex` objects and then tries to access the `is_monotonic` attribute for each level.
3. The failing test triggers an error when trying to check `is_monotonic` because the `_engine` method in the `PeriodIndex` class returns a `NoneType` object instead of a valid engine object.
4. The bug causes the `PeriodEngine` to return a `NoneType` object instead of the expected engine object, leading to an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute.

### Fix Strategy:
1. The `_engine` method is supposed to return an instance of the engine for the `PeriodIndex`.
2. To fix the bug, ensure that the `_engine` method correctly initializes and returns an instance of the engine type.
3. Use `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref` to create a proxy object that won't break the weak reference cycle.
4. Verify that the correct engine type is used and that it returns a valid engine object instead of `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    engine_instance = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine_instance is None:
        raise ValueError("Failed to initialize engine")
    return engine_instance
``` 

By implementing this corrected version, the `_engine` method should now return a valid engine instance for the `PeriodIndex`, addressing the issue seen in the failing test.
