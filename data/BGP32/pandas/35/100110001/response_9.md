### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` method in the `pandas.core.indexes.period` module.
- The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is trying to assert the monotonic nature of levels in a `MultiIndex` object.
- The error message indicates an `AttributeError` in the `PeriodEngine` class where a `NoneType` object is being accessed for the `view` attribute.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is likely caused by the `_engine` method in the `PeriodEngine` class returning a `None` object, leading to the `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute from a `NoneType` object.

### Fix Strategy:
- The `_engine` method should be modified to properly handle creating and returning the `PeriodEngine` object instead of returning `None`.
- Ensure that the `weakref` reference is correctly passed to `_engine_type` to avoid any reference cycle issues.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        engine = self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
    return engine
``` 

By modifying the `_engine` method to handle the case where the `engine` object is `None`, we can prevent the `AttributeError` from occurring. This corrected version should address the issue and allow the test to pass successfully.
