### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` decorator function defined in the `pandas.core.indexes.period` module.
2. The error message in the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` indicates an `AttributeError` related to a `NoneType` object not having the attribute `view`.
3. The failing test is trying to check if the levels of the `MultiIndex` object `idx2` are monotonic, and the failing assertion is due to an issue in the `_engine` function.
4. The `PeriodEngine` type `_engine_type` is likely producing a `NoneType` object being returned, causing the `AttributeError`.
   
### Bug Cause:
The `_engine` function in the buggy code is returning a `NoneType` object instead of the expected engine type, which leads to the `AttributeError` in the failing test when trying to access the `view` attribute.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine` function returns the correct engine type object rather than a `NoneType` object, resolving the `AttributeError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine_type
``` 

By returning the `engine_type` after creating it from `_engine_type`, the corrected version ensures that a valid engine object is returned, resolving the `AttributeError` issue in the failing test.
