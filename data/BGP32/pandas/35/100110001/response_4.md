### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`.
- The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is trying to check if the levels of the MultiIndex `idx2` are monotonic.
- The error message indicates an `AttributeError` related to `self._engine.is_monotonic_increasing`.

### Potential Error location:
- The issue might be arising from the way the weak reference `period` is being created and used within the `_engine` function.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is likely caused by the weak reference not being handled correctly within the `_engine` function. It seems that the `_engine_type` function is not able to use the weak reference created, leading to the `NoneType` object error.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Instead of creating a weak reference to `self` within the `_engine` function, a directly accessible reference to `self` should be passed to `_engine_type`.
- This will ensure that `_engine_type` has a valid reference to `self` to avoid the `NoneType` error.

### Corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By directly passing `self` to `_engine_type`, the corrected version of the `_engine` function ensures that a valid reference to `self` is used, eliminating the weak reference-related bug.
