### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a cache-read-only property that returns the engine type for the PeriodIndex.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is trying to assert that all levels in `idx2` are monotonic.
3. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` within the `_do_monotonic_check` function in the `IndexEngine` class when trying to access `view("i8")`.
4. The bug is likely due to the `_engine` method returning `None` instead of the expected engine type.

### Bug Cause:
The `_engine` method is creating a weak reference to `self` but is not correctly constructing the `PeriodEngine` with this reference. This results in a `NoneType` error when accessing attributes of the engine later on.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, the `_engine` method should properly construct the engine using the weak reference to `self`. We can modify the return statement to create the `PeriodEngine` object correctly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))  # Create the PeriodEngine object from the weak reference
```

By modifying the return statement to `return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))`, we ensure that the `PeriodEngine` object is correctly created and returned. This should resolve the `AttributeError` and make the test pass successfully.
