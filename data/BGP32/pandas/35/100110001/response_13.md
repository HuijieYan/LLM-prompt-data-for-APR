### Analysis:
1. The `test_get_level_values_when_periods` test function is trying to verify if the level values of the MultiIndex `idx2` are monotonic.
2. The failing assert statement specifically checks for monotonicity using the `is_monotonic` attribute.
3. The error message points to an issue with the `_engine` attribute, which is accessed during the monotonic check.
4. The `_engine` function is returning the result of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, which seems to be causing the issue when accessing the `vgetter()` method.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is most likely due to a reference cycle or improper initialization of the `_engine` attribute, leading to a `NoneType` object being accessed when trying to call the `view("i8")` method.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug:
- Ensure the proper initialization of the `_engine` attribute to avoid reference cycles.
- Check the implementation of the `_engine_type` method to ensure it returns a valid object.
- Investigate the `vgetter()` method to understand why it is returning `NoneType`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# Corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("Engine initialization failed!")
        
    return engine
```

By ensuring that the `_engine` attribute returns a valid object and handles potential errors during initialization, the corrected function should address the issue encountered in the failing test.
