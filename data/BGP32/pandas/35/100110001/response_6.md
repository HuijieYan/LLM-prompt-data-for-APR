### Analysis:
1. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is asserting that all levels in `idx2` are monotonic.
2. The error message indicates that the issue occurs when trying to check for monotonicity using `is_monotonic`.
3. The failing test uses `idx._get_level_values(level)` to create a new `MultiIndex`, which internally calls `PeriodIndex._engine`, leading to the error.
4. The bug is likely caused by the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class.
5. The error message states that a `NoneType` object has no attribute 'view', which suggests that the `_engine_type` function returns `None`.

### Fix Strategy:
1. The `_engine` function should return a valid instance of the engine type, not `None`.
2. Ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly passed to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# Corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("Invalid engine type")
    
    return engine
``` 

By returning a valid engine instance and performing an additional check in the `_engine` function, the corrected version should address the issue and allow the failing test to pass.
