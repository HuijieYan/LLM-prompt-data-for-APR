### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a cached property that returns an engine type based on the period index. It uses weakref to pass a weak reference of the period index to the `_engine_type` constructor.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a MultiIndex from PeriodIndex objects and then attempts to assert if the levels are monotonic.
3. The error occurs when trying to check monotonicity, which eventually leads to the `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.
4. The bug is likely due to a NoneType object being returned somewhere in the `_engine` function, causing the subsequent error during the monotonicity check.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the `_engine_type` constructor in the `_engine` function is returning an appropriate object and not None.
2. Check the implementation of the `_engine_type` constructor to fix any potential issues that might be causing it to return None.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
    if engine_type is None:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type constructor returned None")
    return engine_type
```

By adding a check for the `None` return and raising an exception if encountered, we can ensure that a valid engine type object is always returned. This should resolve the AttributeError issue in the failing test.
