### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self` which is a Period object. 
2. The bug occurs when trying to access the `_engine` attribute of a weak reference object, leading to an `AttributeError`.
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is checking if the levels of the MultiIndex created from Periods are monotonic, and it fails when trying to check the monotonicity.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine` method returns a valid engine object rather than `NoneType`.
5. One possible strategy to fix this bug is to modify the `_engine` method to directly store the weak reference to self properly and then return the engine object using the weak reference.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    # Store the weak reference as a member variable
    self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference to the Period object as a member variable (`self._period_ref`) and then using it to create the engine object, we ensure that the weak reference is properly maintained and prevent the `NoneType` error that was occurring. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
