## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object `period`, but it is not directly used in the subsequent call to `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is trying to check if the levels in the `idx2` MultiIndex object are monotonic, which requires accessing the `_engine` attribute of the levels. This is where the bug is triggered due to the incorrect implementation of the `_engine` function.
3. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` with a message `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, suggesting that the `_engine` is returning `None`, causing the issue when trying to access an attribute on it.
4. To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should correctly use the weak reference `period` when creating the `_engine_type` object, ensuring that the `_engine_type` is properly initialized and not returning `None`.

## Potential Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to pass the weak reference `period` instead of `self` directly to the `_engine_type` constructor to avoid a reference cycle and ensure that the `_engine_type` object is properly initialized.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))  # pass the weak reference as a function call to get the actual object
``` 

By modifying the `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))` to `return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))`, we can ensure that the weak reference `period` is correctly dereferenced to obtain the actual object before passing it to `_engine_type`, fixing the bug and allowing the corrected version to pass the failing test.
