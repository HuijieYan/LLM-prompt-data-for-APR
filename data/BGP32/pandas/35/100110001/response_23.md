### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.
2. The failing test uses `PeriodIndex` object and tries to access the `is_monotonic` attribute on the levels of the index.
3. The buggy function `_engine` is utilized indirectly through the `is_monotonic` check, suggesting that the issue may be related to the initialization of the `_engine` method.
4. The error suggests that the `_engine` method is returning a `NoneType` object, leading to the attribute error when trying to access `view()` method on it.

### Cause of the Bug:
The `_engine` method in the original code has an issue with its implementation where it returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, but the expected correct return value is missing which leads to an attribute error when trying to access properties/methods of a None object.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `_engine` method must be modified to correctly return the engine object without any issues like returning a `NoneType` object.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))()  # Fix: Added function call to instantiate the engine
```

By fixing the function to correctly instantiate the engine object before returning it, the corrected version ensures that the engine is properly initialized, avoiding the `NoneType` error.
