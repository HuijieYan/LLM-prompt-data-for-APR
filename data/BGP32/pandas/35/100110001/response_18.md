### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a cache_readonly function that returns an engine for the PeriodIndex.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is checking if the levels of the MultiIndex created from PeriodIndex are monotonic.
3. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` in the IndexEngine related to the `view` attribute, suggesting that the `_engine` function might be returning `None`, causing the subsequent error when trying to access the `view` attribute.
   
### Bug Cause:
The `_engine` function might be returning `None`, leading to the AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute in the subsequent function calls.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the `_engine` function returns a valid engine type instead of returning `None`.
2. Modify the `_engine` function to properly handle the weakref reference and return the correct engine type instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

from pandas import PeriodEngine

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    if engine is None:
        engine = PeriodEngine(period)
    
    return engine
``` 

By modifying the `_engine` function to check if the engine instance returned by `_engine_type` is None, and if so, creating a new PeriodEngine, the bug can be fixed. This revised implementation ensures that a valid engine type instance is always returned to avoid the AttributeError.
