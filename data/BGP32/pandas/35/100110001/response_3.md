### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self` and then passing this weak reference to `_engine_type`. This approach is commonly used to avoid circular reference issues.
2. The error message indicates an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, which suggests that the `_engine` function is returning `None` instead of the expected object.
3. The failing test is trying to check if the levels obtained from `idx2` are monotonic, and this requires the `_engine` to be functioning correctly to compare the values.
4. The cause of the bug seems to be that the `_engine` function is not returning the appropriate object, leading to the `NoneType` attribute error. This could be due to the weak reference handling or the way the `_engine_type` function is being used.
5. To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should ensure that it returns the correct object and that the weak reference handling is done appropriately.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

from pandas.util._decorators import Appender, cache_readonly, doc

# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine =  self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type function returned None")
    return engine
```

With this correction, the `_engine` function will check if the engine object returned by `_engine_type` is `None`, and if so, it will raise a `ValueError` to indicate that the function should not return `None`. This should prevent the `AttributeError` seen in the failing test.
