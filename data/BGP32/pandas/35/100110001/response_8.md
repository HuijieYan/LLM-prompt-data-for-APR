### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` in the `period.py` file is missing the creation of the `_engine_type` instance. It is trying to access the instance directly without instantiating it, which leads to a `NoneType` error.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `_engine_type` instance is not created before trying to access its attributes. This causes the `_engine` function to return `None`, leading to the `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error in the failing test.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to instantiate the `_engine_type` object before accessing its attributes. This can be done by adding the instantiation code to the `_engine` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_instance = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine_instance
```

By making this change, the `_engine` function now correctly instantiates the `_engine_type` object before returning it, fixing the bug and allowing the failing test to pass.
