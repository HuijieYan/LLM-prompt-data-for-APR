### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `period.py` file is using a `weakref` to avoid a reference cycle.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is trying to check if all level values are monotonic, which involves checking `is_monotonic` which in turn calls `_engine.is_monotonic_increasing`, leading to the error.
3. The error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` object is of type `None`, causing an `AttributeError` when trying to access `.view("i8")`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `_engine` function returning a `NoneType` object instead of the expected type. This causes an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` method on the `NoneType` object.

### Fix Strategy:
The `_engine` function is supposed to return an instance of `PeriodEngine`, but it is currently returning `None`. This could be due to a missing assignment or instantiation within the function. The fix involves ensuring that the `_engine` function correctly returns an instance of `PeriodEngine`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine
``` 

By ensuring that the `engine` instance is properly assigned and returned by the `_engine` function, it should resolve the `NoneType` object issue and prevent the `AttributeError`.
