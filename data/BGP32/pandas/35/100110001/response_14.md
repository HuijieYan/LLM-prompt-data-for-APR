### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, but it seems like it is not being used correctly in the `_engine_type` call. This may be causing the `AttributeError` due to a `NoneType` object not having the `view` attribute.
- The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is related to checking if the levels of the index are monotonic.
- The error message indicates that the bug is happening in the `IndexEngine` when trying to check if the values are monotonic increasing.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug is likely caused by improper handling of the weak reference `period` in the `_engine` function. This incorrect usage is causing the `IndexEngine` to receive a `NoneType` object where it expects something else, leading to the `AttributeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Instead of directly passing the weak reference `period` to the `_engine_type` constructor, we should first try to extract the actual object from the weak reference before passing it. This will ensure that the `_engine_type` receives the correct object.
- We also need to ensure that the weak reference does not get garbage collected before it is used in the `_engine_type`. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference in a variable that persists as long as needed.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    period = period_weakref()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if period is not None else None
```

By making the above corrections, we ensure that the correct object is passed to the `_engine_type`, addressing the `AttributeError` caused by the misuse of weak references.
