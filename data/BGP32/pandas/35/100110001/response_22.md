### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a cached read-only property that is supposed to return the engine type for the period index.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is checking if the level values of a MultiIndex created with PeriodIndex are monotonic.
3. The error message indicates an issue with attribute access related to `self._engine` being a `NoneType`.
4. The bug is likely due to the `_engine_type` not being correctly instantiated within the `_engine` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `_engine_type` not being correctly initialized within the `_engine` function, leading to it being set as `None`.

### Fix Strategy:
Ensure that the `_engine_type` is properly created and returned by the `_engine` function before attributing any properties to it.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    # Need to instantiate _engine_type with valid values
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    return engine
``` 

By correctly instantiating `_engine_type` with the values passed to it, we prevent the `NoneType` error from occurring, and the corrected function should now correctly return the engine for the PeriodIndex. This should resolve the bug and make the failing test pass.
