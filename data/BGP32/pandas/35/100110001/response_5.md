### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is attempting to create a weak reference to `self` and then initialize the `_engine_type` with that weak reference and the length of `self`. The error seems to be related to the `_engine_type` not being properly set.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is trying to check if the levels of the MultiIndex `idx2` are monotonic, which involves calling `is_monotonic` on each level. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `self._engine` attribute when trying to check for monotonicity.
3. The error message suggests that there is an AttributeError related to the `view` method being called on a `NoneType` object, which implies that the `_engine` attribute is not set properly which leads to `self._engine` being `None`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine` attribute is properly set so that it does not evaluate to `None` when accessed.
5. We need to update the `_engine` function to properly set the `_engine_type` attribute before returning it.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    if not hasattr(self, '_engine_type'):
        self._engine_type = self._engine_type_factory()
    
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the `_engine_type` attribute is already set for the object. If it is not set, we initialize it using the `_engine_type_factory` method. This ensures that the `_engine_type` attribute is properly set before creating the weak reference and returning the `_engine_type` object. This fix should address the AttributeError seen in the failing test.
