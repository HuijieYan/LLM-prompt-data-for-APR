### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` incorrectly because `weakref.ref(self)` creates a weak reference to `self`, but it doesn't maintain a reference count of `self`, leading to the weak reference being deallocated before it is being used. This causes the error in the failing test.
2. The failing test is trying to access `is_monotonic` property of `idx2.levels`, which then cascades into calling the `_engine` method of PeriodIndex, eventually leading to the AttributeError due to the weak reference issue.
   
### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of weak reference in the `_engine` function. When accessing the weak reference, it might already be deallocated, resulting in a 'NoneType' object error.

### Fix Strategy:
- Change the weak reference usage to something that ensures the `self` object is still alive when accessed.
- Use a proper way to create weak references to `self` which maintains a reference count.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)  # Create a weak reference
    if period_ref() is not None:  # Check if the object is alive
        return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
    else:
        raise RuntimeError("Weak reference to self object is no longer valid.")
``` 

By implementing a check to ensure the object is still alive before using the weak reference, we can avoid the 'NoneType' error in the failing test.
