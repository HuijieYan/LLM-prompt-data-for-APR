### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine()` is a cached property that returns the engine type for the `PeriodIndex` object. It uses a weak reference to avoid reference cycles.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods()` creates a `PeriodIndex` object and attempts to check if the level values are monotonic.
3. The error message indicates an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, which suggests that the `_engine` attribute is returning `None` instead of an actual engine.
4. The bug is likely in the `_engine` function where the `period` weak reference is not correctly passed to the `_engine_type`.
5. A potential fix would involve ensuring that the weak reference is being correctly utilized to prevent the `NoneType` error.

### Proposed Fix:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By changing `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))` to `return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))`, we ensure that the weak reference `period` is correctly dereferenced to obtain the actual object before passing it to `_engine_type`. This should resolve the `NoneType` error and allow the test to pass successfully.
