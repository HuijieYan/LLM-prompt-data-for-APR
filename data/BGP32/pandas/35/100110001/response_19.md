### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a cacheable read-only property method that returns the engine type for a PeriodIndex object by passing a weak reference of the object.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is checking if the levels of the index are monotonic.
3. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` related to the `PeriodEngine` object, specifically with the `vgetter` method.
4. The bug is likely due to an incorrect implementation of the `_engine` method, leading to a `NoneType` object being accessed in the engine type.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine` method returns a valid engine object without any `NoneType` properties.

### Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine_type is None:
        engine_type = PandasArray(self.array, copy=False)
    return engine_type
```

By checking if the `engine_type` is `None`, we can provide a fallback mechanism to create a new `PandasArray` object if the engine type is not valid. This fix should address the `AttributeError` occurring in the failing test.

After applying this fix, the `_engine` method should be able to return a valid engine object, resolving the issue in the failing test.
