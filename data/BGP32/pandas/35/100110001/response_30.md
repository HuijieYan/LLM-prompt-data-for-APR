### Analysis:
- The `test_get_level_values_when_periods` test function is checking if all level values of the `idx2` MultiIndex are monotonic.
- The failing test is due to the `is_monotonic` property accessing the `_engine`, which is returning a `NoneType` object causing an `AttributeError`.
- The `_engine` function defined in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file is using `weakref.ref()` to create a weak reference of `self` and then constructing `_engine_type` with that weak reference. This approach is leading to the `_engine` function return a `NoneType` object, which is not expected by the calling code.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `_engine` function returning a `NoneType` object instead of the expected engine type, resulting in an `AttributeError` when accessing attributes of this `NoneType` object in the subsequent code.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine` function properly constructs and returns the correct engine type object instead of returning `NoneType`. This can be achieved by directly passing `self` to `_engine_type` without creating a weak reference using `weakref`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# Corrected version
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
``` 

By directly passing `self` to `_engine_type` instead of using `weakref`, the corrected version of the function should now return the expected engine object rather than `NoneType`, fixing the bug and allowing the test to pass successfully.
