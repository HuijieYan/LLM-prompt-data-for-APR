### Analysis:
1. The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference of `self` (PeriodIndex) and then passing it to `_engine_type` along with the length of the PeriodIndex.
2. The test is failing due to the weak reference of the PeriodIndex being dropped before intended, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving `None` instead of the PeriodIndex.
3. The weak reference issue is causing the test to fail when checking if all levels of the new MultiIndex are monotonic.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference of self is maintained throughout the `_engine` function.

### Bug Fix:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Maintain a strong reference to self to prevent it from being dropped
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)`, we maintain a strong reference to self (PeriodIndex) to prevent it from being dropped prematurely, resolving the weak reference issue.

After making this fix, the test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` should pass successfully.
