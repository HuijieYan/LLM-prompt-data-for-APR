### Analysis:
1. The `_engine` function uses a weak reference to self to avoid reference cycles, but it is not being correctly utilized.
2. The failing test case involves creating a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` and checking if the levels are monotonic.
3. The issue on GitHub describes that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped prematurely, leading to a `None` value being passed to the `PeriodEngine`.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug arises because the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is not being properly maintained, leading to the weak reference being deleted before it should, resulting in a `None` value being passed to the `PeriodEngine`.

### Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to self is maintained throughout the usage in the `_engine` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By modifying the function to pass the `PeriodIndex` obtained from the weak reference (`period()`) to the `_engine_type`, we ensure that the weak reference is correctly utilized, preventing premature deletion and resolving the bug.
