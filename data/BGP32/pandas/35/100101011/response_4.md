## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` from `PeriodIndex` values and checks for monotonicity of levels, but the weak reference handling in `_engine` is causing the test to fail.
3. The issue on GitHub highlights that the weak reference to `PeriodIndex` is getting dropped prematurely, leading to a `None` being passed to `_engine_type`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` remains valid until it is used by `_engine_type`.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Instead of directly returning the weak reference created in `_engine`, we need to extract the original object from the weak reference before using it in `_engine_type`.
2. By doing so, we can avoid the weak reference being dropped prematurely and prevent passing `None` to `_engine_type`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# Updated corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By extracting the original object from the weak reference using `weakref.ref(self)()`, we ensure that the object remains valid until it is used by `_engine_type`. This corrected version should resolve the issue and enable the failing test to pass successfully.
