## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a cached readonly function that returns an instance of `_engine_type` initialized with a weak reference of `self` and the length of the object.
2. The bug seems to be related to the handling of weak references, which results in the `period` being assigned a weak reference to `self` incorrectly.
3. This bug causes the `self` reference to be dropped prematurely, resulting in `None` being passed to `_engine_type`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is correctly assigned to `self` and prevent premature reference dropping.
5. We will adjust the function to correctly handle weak references and ensure that `self` remains accessible during the `_engine_type` initialization process.

## Bug Fix

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(lambda: period, len(self))
```

In the corrected version of the function, we use a lambda function to wrap the `weakref.ref(self)` call. This ensures that the weak reference is obtained only when `_engine_type` is called, preventing premature dropping of the reference. By passing a lambda function instead of a direct weak reference, we maintain access to `self` when initializing `_engine_type`. This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and pass the failing test.
