### Analysis
The `_engine` function is attempting to create a weak reference to `self` and pass it to `_engine_type`. However, it is not correctly creating the weak reference, which leads to the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before intended. This results in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`, causing the failing test.

### Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is the incorrect creation of the weak reference using `weakref.ref(self)`, which does not properly retain the reference to `self`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly created and that it remains valid during the `_engine_type` call. We should modify the `_engine` function to create a proper weak reference to `self` and provide it to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weakref.proxy instead of weakref.ref to maintain the reference
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we ensure that the reference to `self` remains valid during the `_engine_type` call, resolving the bug and making the test pass.
