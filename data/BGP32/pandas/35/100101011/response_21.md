### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is using weak referencing to avoid reference cycles. In this case, the weak reference to `self` (PeriodIndex) is used to create the engine object. However, the weak reference `period` is not being dereferenced correctly when passing it to `_engine_type`. This leads to the `_engine_type` function receiving `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`, causing the test to fail.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the weak reference `period` is not being properly dereferenced before passing it to `_engine_type`, resulting in `None` being passed instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the weak reference `period` should be dereferenced before passing it to `_engine_type`. This ensures that the correct `PeriodIndex` object is passed to the `_engine_type` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference to `self` is dereferenced using `()` before passing it to `_engine_type`, ensuring that the correct `PeriodIndex` object is received by `_engine_type`. This should resolve the bug and make the failing test pass.
