### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to avoid a reference cycle and then calls `_engine_type` with the weak reference. However, the implementation is causing issues with weak referencing.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is trying to create a MultiIndex from a PeriodIndex and then checking if the levels are monotonic. It fails due to weak referencing issues during the creation of the MultiIndex.
3. The bug causes the weak reference to be dropped prematurely, leading to `None` being passed instead of `PeriodIndex` to the `PeriodEngine`.
4. To fix this bug, the weak reference handling needs to be adjusted to ensure proper referencing and prevent premature dropping.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the weak referencing mechanism to ensure that the reference is maintained until it is properly used in the `_engine_type`.
2. Make sure that the weak reference is not lost during the creation of the `PeriodEngine`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref(), len(self))
```

By creating a variable `period_ref` to hold the weak reference and calling `period_ref()` in `_engine_type`, we ensure that the reference is maintained until it is needed, resolving the weak referencing issue. This correction should address the bug and make the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` pass successfully.
