### Potential Error Locations
1. The weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` might not be correctly implemented, leading to the engine receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.
2. The instantiation of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` might not be handling the weak reference properly.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug seems to be caused by the weak reference not being maintained correctly, resulting in the engine receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This leads to the failing test as the engine is unable to process the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex`.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained throughout the process so that the engine receives the intended input. This can be achieved by modifying the weak reference implementation and ensuring that it is correctly handled while instantiating the engine.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By modifying the function to use `period()` instead of `period`, we correctly dereference the weak reference, ensuring that the engine receives the actual `PeriodIndex` object. This correction should resolve the issue and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
