### Analysis:
1. The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` uses a `MultiIndex` containing `PeriodIndex` instances.
3. The issue described on GitHub highlights that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before intended, leading to a `None` being passed to `PeriodEngine`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the premature dropping of the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance, resulting in `None` being passed to `_engine_type`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, ensure that the weak reference is maintained until it is no longer needed by `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Maintain a strong reference to the object temporarily
    self_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    period = self_weakref()
    
    # Check if the referenced object exists
    if period is not None:
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        raise ValueError("Weak reference to PeriodIndex is no longer valid")
``` 

This corrected version ensures that a strong reference to the object is kept until it is actually used, preventing premature dropping of the weak reference.
