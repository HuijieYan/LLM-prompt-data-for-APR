### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is a PeriodIndex object.
2. The function then passes this weak reference to `self._engine_type` along with the length of the PeriodIndex.
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a MultiIndex containing a PeriodIndex and then tries to retrieve level values from it. The bug causes the weak reference to be dropped prematurely, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The issue arises from the premature dropping of the weak reference to the PeriodIndex object before it is used by the `_engine_type`. This results in `_engine_type` receiving `None` instead of the expected PeriodIndex.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, ensure that the weak reference to `self` remains valid until it is used by `_engine_type`. One way to achieve this is by maintaining a reference to the weak reference itself until after `_engine_type` is called.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
from pandas import PeriodIndex

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weak_period, len(self))
```

By modifying the function to store the weak reference in a variable (`weak_period`), we ensure that the weak reference remains valid until it is used by `_engine_type`. This correction should address the premature dropping of the weak reference and resolve the issue in the failing test.
