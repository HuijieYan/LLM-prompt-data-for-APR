The bug in the `_engine` function is caused by the usage of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, but then passing the weak reference itself as an argument to `_engine_type`. This results in passing a weak reference object instead of the actual `self` object to `_engine_type`, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to pass the actual object referenced by the weak reference. We can achieve this by calling the weak reference object (`period`) with `()` to get the actual object.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By making this change, the correct `self` object will be passed to `_engine_type`, resolving the bug and ensuring that the test case provided will pass successfully.
