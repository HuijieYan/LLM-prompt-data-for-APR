### Analysis:
1. The `_engine` function is a cache_readonly decorator function that returns the `_engine_type` based on the input parameters `self` and `len(self)`.
2. The issue seems to be related to weak referencing `self` causing a problem with the `PeriodEngine`.
3. The failing test involves creating a `PeriodIndex` and then copying its levels to a `MultiIndex`. This process seems to trigger the issue related to weak referencing.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because of weak referencing `self` in the `_engine` function, which leads to a None value being passed to the `PeriodEngine`, resulting in an incorrect behavior.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak referencing of `self` correctly maintains the reference to the `PeriodIndex` to prevent None values from being passed to the `PeriodEngine`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By adjusting the code to pass `period()` instead of just `period`, we ensure that the weak reference correctly maintains the reference to the `PeriodIndex` object, resolving the issue with weak referencing.
