Based on the provided information, the bug in the `_engine` function is related to weak referencing of the `PeriodIndex` object. The `period = weakref.ref(self)` creates a weak reference to `self`, but the weak reference `period` is not being used correctly when calling `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. This results in the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is correctly passed to `_engine_type`. Below is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `period()` is used to retrieve the original object from the weak reference. This ensures that the `PeriodIndex` object is correctly passed to the `_engine_type` function.

By making this change, the corrected function should address the weak reference issue and pass the correct object to the `PeriodEngine`, resolving the bug identified in the failing test case and the GitHub issue.
