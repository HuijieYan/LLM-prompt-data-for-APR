### Analysis:
1. The `@cache_readonly` decorator suggests that the `_engine` function is meant to be cached and only calculated once.
2. The function attempts to create a weak reference to `self` (presumably a `PeriodIndex`) and pass it to `_engine_type`.
3. The bug might arise from how the weak reference is being handled or how it's used in `_engine_type`.

### Potential Error Location:
- The weak reference creation might not be referencing `self` correctly.
- The usage of the weak reference in `_engine_type` could be incorrect.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug causes the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to be lost prematurely, resulting in `_engine_type` receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This leads to errors when the weak reference is accessed.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly maintained throughout the function.
2. Check how the weak reference is utilized in `_engine_type` to guarantee correct usage.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Ensure that period() retrieves the referenced object
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By modifying the return statement to invoke `period()` and get the referenced object, we can ensure that the weak reference is correctly used when passed to `_engine_type`. This correction should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
