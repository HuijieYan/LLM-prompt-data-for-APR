### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference of `self`, which is likely causing the issue with weak reference handling observed in the failing test.
2. The failing test is related to copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`, which leads to the loss of weakrefs.
3. In the failing test, the `MultiIndex` is created from a `PeriodIndex`, and then level values are obtained. The issue arises due to the weak reference handling at the `_engine` function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference handling is appropriately maintained during the creation of the engine type.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Amend the `_engine` function to correctly handle the weak reference creation.
2. Ensure that the engine type receives the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to prevent the loss of weakrefs.
3. Update the function to maintain the weak reference until it's used by the engine type.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weak_period(), len(self))
```

By updating the `_engine` function to create a weak reference using `weakref.ref(self)` and passing the weak reference object using `weak_period()`, we ensure that the weak reference of `self` is maintained until the engine type is created. This corrected version should resolve the weak reference handling issue and make the failing test pass.
