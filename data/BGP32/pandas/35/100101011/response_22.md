### Analysis:
1. The `_engine` function is using a `weakref` to prevent a reference cycle when creating the `_engine_type`.
2. The issue arises from the weak reference not being maintained properly, leading to `None` being passed to `_engine_type`.
3. The failing test is related to copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`, which loses weak references.
4. To fix the bug, the `_engine` function needs to correctly maintain the `weakref` reference to the `self` object.
5. We need to ensure that the weak reference is not dropped prematurely to avoid passing `None` to `_engine_type`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the premature dropping of the weak reference to the `self` object in the `_engine` function, leading to passing `None` to `_engine_type`.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the weak reference to the `self` object is maintained until it is no longer needed.
2. Revise the `_engine` function to correctly handle the weak reference to prevent passing `None` to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Updated and corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Maintain the weakref reference until the end of the function
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    # Ensure that the weakref object is not None before passing to _engine_type
    if period() is not None:
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        raise ValueError("Weak reference to self object is None")
```

With the above correction, the `_engine` function will properly maintain the weak reference to `self` and ensure that it is not prematurely dropped, resolving the issue of passing `None` to `_engine_type`.
