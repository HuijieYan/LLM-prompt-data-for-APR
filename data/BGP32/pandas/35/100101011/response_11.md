### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is utilizing `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference of the `self` parameter (assumed to be a `PeriodIndex`) and then passing it to `_engine_type` to create an instance. However, based on the GitHub issue and the failing test, the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped prematurely, leading to `None` being passed to `_engine_type`, causing the failing test.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the premature dropping of the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` before it is intended to be used by `_engine_type`. This results in `None` being passed instead of the actual `PeriodIndex`, leading to failures in subsequent operations.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` remains available when used by `_engine_type`. It can be achieved by ensuring that the weak reference remains valid until `_engine_type` is called.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self), self)  # Pass self along with the weak reference
```

By passing `self` along with the weak reference, the `PeriodIndex` object is kept valid until `_engine_type` is called, resolving the premature dropping issue. This correction should address the bug and make the failing test pass as expected.
