The bug in the `_engine` function is caused by passing a `weakref` of `self` to `_engine_type` but not properly retaining that weak reference, leading to the reference being dropped prematurely. This results in `None` being passed to `PeriodEngine` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is stored and accessed correctly within the function. Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
from pandas.util._decorators import Appender, cache_readonly, doc

# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference to self
    self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference to `self` within an instance variable `_period_weakref`, we ensure that the reference is not dropped prematurely and is accessible when needed by `PeriodEngine`.
This correction should address the issue reported on GitHub and enable the failing test to pass successfully.
