### Analysis:
1. The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` (PeriodIndex) and pass it to `_engine_type`. The issue seems to be related to the weak reference being dropped prematurely.
2. The failing test is checking the monotonicity of the levels of a MultiIndex created from a PeriodIndex.
3. The bug causes `_engine_type` to receive `None` instead of the intended PeriodIndex due to premature dropping of the weak reference.
4. To fix the bug, ensure that the weak reference to `self` remains valid throughout the `_engine` function's execution.
5. The corrected version of the function should handle the weak reference properly to avoid premature dropping.

### Bug Fix:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use a variable to hold the weak reference to prevent premature dropping
    weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weak_period, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference in a variable within the `_engine` function, we prevent it from being dropped prematurely, ensuring that `_engine_type` receives the correct reference to the PeriodIndex. This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test pass.
