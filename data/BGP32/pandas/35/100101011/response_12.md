### Analysis:
1. The `_engine` function is intended to return the PeriodEngine type with a weak reference to the `self` PeriodIndex to avoid reference cycles.
2. The bug arises from creating a weak reference `period` to `self`, but not passing it correctly to `_engine_type`.
3. This bug causes the PeriodEngine to receive `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`, leading to an error in the test case.

### Correction Strategy:
1. Update the `_engine` function to correctly pass the weak reference `period` to `_engine_type`.
2. Ensure that the `PeriodIndex` is properly passed along with the weak reference.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By updating the `_engine` function to pass `period()` (the result of calling the weak reference) instead of just `period`, we ensure that the `PeriodIndex` is correctly passed to the `PeriodEngine`, resolving the bug and allowing the test case to pass.
