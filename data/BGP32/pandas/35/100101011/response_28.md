### Analysis:
1. The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` (a `PeriodIndex` object) to avoid reference cycles.
2. The bug might be related to the weak reference handling which results in `period` being `None` at some point.
3. The test case is failing because the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is lost before it can be used by the `PeriodEngine`.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the weak reference `period` becoming `None` (losing reference) before it is passed to `self._engine_type`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` remains valid until it is used inside the `_engine_type` method. This can be achieved by keeping a strong reference to the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Keep a strong reference to the weakly referenced PeriodIndex object
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    period_ref = period()
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

By adding `period_ref = period()` to create a strong reference to the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object, we ensure that the reference remains valid until it is used in `_engine_type`.

This correction should address the issue reported on GitHub and should also make the failing test pass successfully.
