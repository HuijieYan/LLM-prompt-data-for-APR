## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is a `PeriodIndex` object.
2. The issue described in GitHub states that the weak reference is being dropped before it's supposed to, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` object from a `PeriodIndex` and then checks if the levels are monotonic.
4. The current implementation of `_engine` is likely causing the weak reference to be lost prematurely, leading to the failure in the test.

## Bug Explanation
The bug arises from the premature drop of the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` before the `PeriodEngine` receives it. This results in the `PeriodEngine` getting `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`, causing the test to fail.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` (`PeriodIndex`) is maintained until the `PeriodEngine` is created. One possible solution is to use a `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref` to maintain the weak reference throughout the function.

## Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref.proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy`, we are maintaining the weak reference to `self` until it is passed to the `PeriodEngine`, addressing the issue of the weak reference being dropped prematurely. This corrected version should resolve the bug and make the failing test pass.
