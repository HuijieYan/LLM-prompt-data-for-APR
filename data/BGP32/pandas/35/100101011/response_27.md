### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`, a `PeriodIndex` object, to avoid reference cycles.
2. The bug is likely occurring because the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped prematurely, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is checking if all levels in the `MultiIndex` are monotonic, but due to the premature dropping of the weak reference, it fails.

### Bug Cause:
The premature dropping of the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` in the `_engine` function leads to the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`. This results in the failing test since the levels of the `MultiIndex` are not properly constructed.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is kept alive until it is used to create the `PeriodEngine`. One way to achieve this is to store the weak reference as an instance variable of the `PeriodIndex` object to prevent it from being garbage collected prematurely.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Storing the weak reference as an instance variable to prevent premature dropping
    self._weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._weak_period, len(self))
``` 

By storing the weak reference as `self._weak_period`, we ensure that the reference is alive until it is used in creating the `PeriodEngine`. This fix should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
