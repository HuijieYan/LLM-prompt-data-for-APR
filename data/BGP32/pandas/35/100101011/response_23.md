### Identified issue:
The issue is due to the `_engine` function not properly handling weak references to the `PeriodIndex` object, leading to a `None` being passed instead of the `PeriodIndex` to the `PeriodEngine`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is correctly utilized in the `_engine` function to avoid reference cycle issues and accurately pass the reference to the `PeriodEngine`.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use a weak reference to avoid reference cycle
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `period()` is used to retrieve the referenced `PeriodIndex` object correctly before passing it to the `PeriodEngine`.

By applying this fix, the `_engine` function should handle weak references appropriately and resolve the issue described in the GitHub problem statement.
