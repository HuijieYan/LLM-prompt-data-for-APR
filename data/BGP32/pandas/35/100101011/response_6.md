### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` and then passing it to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`. The issue seems to be related to weak references not working as intended, causing the PeriodIndex to be dropped before it should.

### Potential Error Location
The issue might be with how the weak reference `period` is being used or handled in `_engine_type`.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is causing the weakly referenced PeriodIndex to be dropped prematurely before it reaches the PeriodEngine, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving `None` instead of the PeriodIndex.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until it reaches the PeriodEngine. This can be achieved by properly handling the weak reference or adjusting the weak reference implementation.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
Here's a corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_result = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine_result
```

By ensuring that the weak reference `period` is maintained until the result of `_engine_type` is returned, we can fix the premature dropping of the PeriodIndex. This correction should address the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report and make the failing test pass.
