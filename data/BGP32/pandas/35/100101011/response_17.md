### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` incorrectly, causing the weak reference to be lost prematurely. This leads to the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`. This issue is related to copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` leading to weakrefs being lost.

### Potential Error Location
The error lies in the implementation of the `_engine` function where the weak reference is not retained properly.

### Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the weak reference `period` created with `weakref.ref(self)` does not have a strong reference and is lost before being used in the `_engine_type` function, resulting in `None` being passed instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the weak reference `period` needs to be stored in a variable that has a strong reference. One way to achieve this is by creating a local variable within the `_engine` function to hold the weak reference.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a local variable to hold the weak reference
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference in `period_ref` with a strong reference, the correct `PeriodIndex` object will be passed to the `PeriodEngine` as intended, fixing the bug.
