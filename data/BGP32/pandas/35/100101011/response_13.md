## Identified Bug:
The bug in the `_engine` function lies in how it handles the weak reference to `self`. The `weakref.ref(self)` creates a weak reference object, but it should be dereferenced back to the original object before being used by `_engine_type`.

The bug causes the `_engine` function to return `None` instead of the actual `PeriodIndex` object. This behavior leads to failures in the test cases, as they expect the `PeriodIndex` object to be correctly passed to `_engine_type`.

## Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to dereference the weak reference object before passing it to `_engine_type`. This can be achieved by calling the `period()` method on the weak reference object.

## The corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` on the weak reference `period`, we retrieve the original object `self` and pass it to `_engine_type`, resolving the issue of passing `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex` object.

With this correction, the `test_get_level_values_when_periods` test should now pass successfully.
