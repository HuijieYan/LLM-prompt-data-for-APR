### Analysis
1. The `_engine` function is using a `weakref` to avoid reference cycles.
2. The function creates a weak reference to `self` as `period`.
3. The `_engine_type` is called with `period` and the length of the current object.
4. The failing test involves creating a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex`.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the weak reference created inside the `_engine` function is not properly utilized or maintained, leading to a loss of reference to the `PeriodIndex`. This results in the `_engine_type` function receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference created remains valid until it is used. We can modify the function to keep a strong reference to the weak reference until the call to `_engine_type` is made.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Maintain a strong reference to the weak reference to prevent premature garbage collection
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self), self)
```

By modifying the `_engine` function to pass the actual reference to `_engine_type` along with the weak reference, we ensure that the reference to `self` is not lost prematurely. This should address the issue and allow the failing test to pass.
