The buggy function `_engine` is creating a weak reference to `self` and then passing it to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`. The issue lies in how the weak reference is being used in this context.

The cause of the bug is that when `weakref.ref(self)` is created, it returns a weak reference object that needs to be accessed properly to get the original object. However, in this case, the weak reference object `period` is being passed directly to `_engine_type` without dereferencing it, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, the weak reference object needs to be dereferenced to obtain the original `self` object before passing it to `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By dereferencing the weak reference object with `()` after `weakref.ref(self)`, we obtain the original `self` object to pass to `_engine_type`, which should now correctly handle the input and resolve the bug.
