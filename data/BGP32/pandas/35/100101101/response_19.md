## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_engine` function lies in how `weakref.ref()` is used. In the buggy code, `period = weakref.ref(self)` stores a weak reference to `self`, which may lead to unexpected behavior. 

When `_engine_type` is called with `period` as an argument, it may not work as expected due to the weak reference.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we should directly pass `self` to `_engine_type` without using `weakref` which might be causing the issue. This will ensure that the correct reference to `self` is passed to `_engine_type`.

## Corrected Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
``` 

By directly passing `self` to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the correct reference is used, fixing the bug. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and provide the expected output.
