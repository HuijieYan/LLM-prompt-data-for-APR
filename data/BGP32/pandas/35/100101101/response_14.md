## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self` and then passing it to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`. The issue lies in the fact that `weakref.ref` creates a weak reference object, not the actual reference to `self`. This can be problematic as the weak reference may not carry the necessary information to be used properly in `_engine_type`.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by passing a weak reference object `period` to `_engine_type` instead of the actual reference to `self`. This causes `_engine_type` to potentially operate on incomplete or invalid data, leading to incorrect behavior.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to pass the actual reference to `self` to `_engine_type` instead of a weak reference object. We can achieve this by directly passing `self` to `_engine_type`.

## Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
