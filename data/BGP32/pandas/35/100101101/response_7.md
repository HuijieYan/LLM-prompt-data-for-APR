The bug in the provided function `_engine` lies in how the weak reference `period` is created and passed to `_engine_type`. In the current implementation, `weakref.ref(self)` is being called, which returns a weak reference object. Instead, we should extract the actual object from the weak reference using `period()`.

The corrected version of the function should look like this:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` on the weak reference object, we are retrieving the actual object referenced by `self`.

This correction should address the bug and allow the function to work correctly.
