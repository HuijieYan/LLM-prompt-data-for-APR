The issue in the buggy function is that it is creating a weak reference to `self` using `weakref.ref(self)`, which is intended to avoid reference cycles but is not being used correctly in this context.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `_engine` function to directly pass `self` to `_engine_type` without creating a weak reference.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# Corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By directly passing `self` to `_engine_type`, we avoid the unnecessary creation of a weak reference and ensure that `self` is correctly passed to `_engine_type`.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
