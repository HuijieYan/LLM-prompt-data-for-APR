The buggy function is attempting to create a weak reference to 'self' and pass it to '_engine_type'. The issue lies in the way the weak reference is being created, which is the cause of the bug. The weak reference should be created using the 'weakref.proxy' function instead of 'weakref.ref'. This will ensure that the weak reference does not prevent the object from being garbage collected.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the buggy function to use 'weakref.proxy' instead of 'weakref.ref' when creating the weak reference to 'self':

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By making this change, the weak reference will not keep a strong reference to 'self' and the bug should be fixed. The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test case provided.
