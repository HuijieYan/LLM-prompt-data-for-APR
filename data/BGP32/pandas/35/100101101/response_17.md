The issue in the buggy function `_engine` is that it is using `weakref.ref(self)` incorrectly, which is causing `self` to be referenced weakly. To fix this, we need to pass `self` directly to `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the function `_engine`:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By passing `self` directly to `_engine_type`, we ensure that `self` is referenced correctly and the function works as expected, fixing the bug.
