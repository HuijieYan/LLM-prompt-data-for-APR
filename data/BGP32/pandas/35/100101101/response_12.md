The issue with the buggy function `_engine` is that it is not correctly passing a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`. This can lead to a reference cycle problem.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `_engine` function to correctly pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```

By using `weakref.ref(self)` instead of `period = weakref.ref(self)`, we ensure that a weak reference of `self` is correctly passed to `_engine_type`.

This correction should address the bug and make the failing test pass as expected.
