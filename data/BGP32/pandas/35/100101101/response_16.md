## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using weakref to create a weak reference to the `self` object and then passing it to `_engine_type`. The issue lies in the way the weak reference is being created and passed. The `weakref.ref(self)` line is not correctly capturing the reference to `self` due to the way weak references work.

## Bug Explanation
The bug causes the weak reference to `self` to be created incorrectly, leading to potential reference cycles and memory leaks. This is a critical issue as it can impact the memory management within the code.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to create a correct weak reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`. We can achieve this by using a lambda function or by using `weakref.proxy`.

## Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Correct way to create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we ensure that a proper weak reference to `self` is created without the issues present in the original buggy function. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and maintain the expected input/output values.
