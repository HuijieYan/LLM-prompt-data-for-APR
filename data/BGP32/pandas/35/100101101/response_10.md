The issue in the provided function is that the weak reference `period` is not being dereferenced properly before passing it to `_engine_type`. This can lead to unexpected behavior when `_engine_type` tries to access the weakly referenced object.

To fix this bug, we need to dereference the weak reference `period` before passing it to `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By directly calling the weak reference `period` as a function `period = weakref.ref(self)()`, we can properly dereference it and avoid any issues related to weak references.

This correction should ensure that the function behaves as expected and passes the failing test.
