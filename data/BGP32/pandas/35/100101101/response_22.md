## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` creates a weak reference to `self` and then calls `_engine_type` with that weak reference and the length of `self`. The issue likely arises from the weak reference being passed to `_engine_type`.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug in the function occurs because passing a weak reference to `_engine_type` may not correctly maintain the reference to `self`, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Fix Strategy
Instead of passing a weak reference to `_engine_type`, the function should directly pass `self`.

## Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
