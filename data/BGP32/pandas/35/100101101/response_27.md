### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` incorrectly. It should be passing `self` instead of a weak reference to `self` to the `_engine_type` function. This is causing the test to fail as the expected values are not being generated correctly due to this issue.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by passing a weak reference (`period`) of `self` to the `_engine_type` function instead of `self`.

### Fix
Modify the `_engine` function to directly pass `self` to the `_engine_type` function.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
