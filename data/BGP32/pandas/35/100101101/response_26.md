The bug in the `_engine` function lies in the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref(self)` which does not correctly create a weak reference to `self`. This leads to a reference cycle issue and incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, we should use `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This fix should resolve the reference cycle issue and ensure that the weak reference is used correctly, allowing the function to operate as intended and pass the failing test case.
