The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` incorrectly. The `weakref.ref` function should take the object that needs a weak reference, not the object itself. In this case, it should take `self` instead of `self`.

To fix the bug, we need to pass `self` directly to `_engine_type`. Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly pass `self` to `_engine_type` and avoid the reference cycle issue. This fix should address the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values provided.
