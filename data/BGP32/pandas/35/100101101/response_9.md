The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`. However, this approach is not correctly preserving the reference to `self` as intended.

The issue lies in the fact that `weakref.ref(self)` returns a weak reference object, not the actual reference to `self`. To fix this, we need to change the way the weak reference is passed to `_engine_type`.

To resolve the bug, we can modify the `_engine` function as follows:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Pass a weak reference of self to _engine_type correctly
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we can pass a correct weak reference to `_engine_type`.

This correction will ensure that the weak reference is correctly passed to `_engine_type`, preventing any reference cycle issues.
