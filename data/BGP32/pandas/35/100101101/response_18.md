The issue in the provided _engine function is that it is using weakref.ref incorrectly, which is resulting in incorrect behavior when creating the engine type. Instead of passing weakref.ref(self) as an argument to the _engine_type function, we should pass self directly.

To fix the bug, we should modify the _engine function as follows:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By making this change, the _engine function will correctly create the engine type with a reference to self, resolving the issue of passing weakref.ref(self) incorrectly.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test case provided.
