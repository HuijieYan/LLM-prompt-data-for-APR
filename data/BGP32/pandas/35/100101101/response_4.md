The bug in the _engine function is that it is creating a weak reference to self but not using it correctly. Instead of passing the weak reference to _engine_type, it is passing a weak reference variable period directly. This causes the function to not work as intended.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the _engine function to use the weak reference properly and dereference it when passing to _engine_type.

Here is the corrected version of the _engine function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling period() instead of passing period directly, we dereference the weak reference and pass the actual object to _engine_type, which fixes the bug.

This corrected version of the _engine function should now pass the failing test case provided.
