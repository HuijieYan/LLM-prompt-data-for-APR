## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`. However, the issue seems to be that it is not correctly referencing `self` in the expected way.

The test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is failing because the `idx2` generated from `MultiIndex.from_arrays` is not producing the expected output, possibly due to the incorrect weak reference passing in the buggy function.

## Bug
The bug lies in the way the weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` is being used. It should be dereferenced to obtain the actual `self` object inside `_engine`.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we need to dereference the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`. Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

This change will correctly dereference the weak reference `period` to obtain the `self` object before passing it to `_engine_type`.

After making this fix, the test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` should pass as the corrected function will produce the expected output.
