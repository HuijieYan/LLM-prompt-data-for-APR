The bug in the `_engine` function is caused by passing a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type` instead of the actual `self`. This results in incorrect behavior when the `_engine_type` function uses the weak reference to operate on `self`.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the `weakref.ref(self)` usage and directly pass `self` to `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By passing `self` directly instead of using a weak reference, the corrected function should now correctly operate on the actual `self` instance, ensuring the expected behavior during test execution.
