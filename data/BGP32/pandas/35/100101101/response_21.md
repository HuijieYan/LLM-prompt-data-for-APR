## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`. The issue lies in passing the weak reference instead of the actual `self` object, which might be causing unexpected behavior in the `_engine_type` function.

## Bug Explanation
The bug is likely causing unexpected behavior or errors in the `_engine_type` function because it is receiving a weak reference to `self` instead of the actual `self` object. This can lead to issues with accessing attributes or methods on the weak reference object.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to pass the actual `self` object instead of a weak reference. This can be achieved by simply passing `self` directly to the `_engine_type` function.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
``` 

By passing `self` directly to the `_engine_type` function, the corrected version of the function will avoid passing a weak reference and should behave as expected.
