## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` incorrectly by passing `self` to `_engine_type` instead of the weak reference object itself. This results in a reference cycle issue. 

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by passing `self` directly to `_engine_type` instead of using the weak reference object.

## Fix Strategy
The fix involves passing the weak reference object (`period`) to `_engine_type` instead of `self`.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
