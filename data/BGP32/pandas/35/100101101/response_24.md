The bug in the `_engine` function lies in the use of `weakref.ref(self)` where it should be `weakref.ref(self._values)` instead. This causes an issue with referencing the correct object when creating the weak reference.

To fix this bug, we should update the `_engine` function to use `weakref.ref(self._values)`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self._values to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self._values)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly create a weak reference to `self._values`, which resolves the bug and allows the test case `test_get_level_values_when_periods` to pass successfully.
