## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` incorrectly, which is causing the weak reference to be stored in the variable `period` instead of the actual reference to `self`. This leads to issues when `self` is used later on to create the `_engine_type` object.

## Bug Explanation
The bug is occurring because the weak reference created using `weakref.ref` is not being dereferenced correctly to obtain the actual object. This results in passing a weak reference instead of a valid reference to `_engine_type`, leading to unexpected behavior and test failures.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to properly dereference the weak reference `period` to get the actual reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`.
