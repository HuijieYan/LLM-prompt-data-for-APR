The issue with the current implementation of the `_engine` function is that it is creating a weak reference to `self` incorrectly. The weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` is only storing a weak reference to `self`, but it is not being used to access the actual `self` object when calling `_engine_type(period, len(self))`.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the implementation of the `_engine` function to properly use the weak reference object to access the actual `self` object. Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Retrieve the actual object from the weak reference
    actual_self = period()
    return self._engine_type(actual_self, len(actual_self))
```

By using `period()` to retrieve the actual `self` object from the weak reference, we ensure that the correct object is being passed to `_engine_type`, which should resolve the issues with the failing test.

This correction ensures that the weak reference is properly used to access the actual object when calling `_engine_type`, meeting the expected behavior and resolving the bug.
