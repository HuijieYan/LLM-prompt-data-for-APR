## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is attempting to create a weak reference to `self` and pass it to `_engine_type`. The issue lies in how the weak reference is created and used. It seems that the weak reference `period` is not being dereferenced correctly when passing it to `_engine_type`, causing unexpected behavior.

## Bug Cause
The bug is likely causing unexpected behavior because the weak reference `period` is created but not dereferenced correctly before passing it to `_engine_type`, leading to incorrect values being used during execution.

## Bug Fix Strategy
We need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is properly dereferenced when passed to `_engine_type`. This can be achieved by using the `period` object to obtain the referenced `self` object before passing it to `_engine_type`.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By dereferencing the weak reference `period` using `period()` before passing it to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the correct `self` object is used during execution. This corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing test case provided.
