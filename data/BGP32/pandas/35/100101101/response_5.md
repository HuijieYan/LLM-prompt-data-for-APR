The buggy function is attempting to create a weak reference to `self` and pass it to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`. However, the issue lies in how the weak reference is created. It should be created by calling `weakref.ref(self)` instead of assigning it to `period`.

The bug causes the weak reference to not be properly created, leading to potential reference cycle issues. This can result in unexpected behavior or memory leaks.

To fix the bug, the weak reference should be created correctly by calling `weakref.ref(self)`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By fixing the creation of the weak reference, the function should now operate as intended and pass the failing test case.
