The bug in the provided function `_engine` is that it uses `weakref.ref` incorrectly. The `weakref.ref` is typically used to create a weak reference to an object to avoid creating a reference cycle and keep it from being garbage collected. However, in this case, the `weakref.ref` is not being used as intended.

The correct way to use `weakref.ref` is to pass the actual object to it, and then when needing to access the object, you call the weak reference object using `()`. In this case, the correct usage would be:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` with the parentheses, you retrieve the original object from the weak reference.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

This fix should address the issue and make the function work correctly with the test provided.
