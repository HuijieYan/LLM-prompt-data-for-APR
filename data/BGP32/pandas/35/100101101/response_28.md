## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` incorrectly by passing `self` directly to it. This can lead to issues as `weakref.ref` expects an object, not a reference to an object. This could create a circular reference rather than preventing it, which defeats the purpose of using `weakref`. The test case `test_get_level_values_when_periods` fails because the buggy function is not handling `self` correctly, which affects the expected output of the test.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by passing `self` directly to `weakref.ref` in the `_engine` function. This creates a circular reference issue, leading to unexpected behavior during the test.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to pass the actual object `self` to the `weakref.ref` function rather than a reference to it. This will allow `weakref` to create a weak reference to the object accurately, preventing circular reference issues.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By passing `period()` instead of `period`, we ensure that `weakref` gets the actual object being referenced, preventing circular references.
