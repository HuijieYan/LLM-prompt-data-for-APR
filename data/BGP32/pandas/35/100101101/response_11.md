The bug in the `_engine` function is that it is creating a weak reference to `self` but not dereferencing it to access the actual object. This results in the `_engine_type` function getting a weak reference instead of the actual object, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to dereference the weak reference `period` before passing it to `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By dereferencing `period` with `period()`, we are passing the actual object instead of the weak reference.

This correction should ensure that the `_engine` function behaves as expected and passes the failing test case.
