## Analysis
1. The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` (presumably to avoid reference cycles), but the return value is not handled correctly.
2. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` with a 'NoneType' object having no attribute 'view'.
3. The failing test involves checking if all level values are monotonic, which is failing due to the incorrect handling of weak references in the `_engine` function.
4. To fix the bug, the weak reference should be handled correctly in the `_engine` function to ensure that it does not lead to 'NoneType' errors.
5. The expected output should return `True` when checking for monotonicity in the levels.

## Fixing the Bug
Based on the analysis, here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Check if the weak reference is not None before returning
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if period() is not None else None
```

This fix ensures that the weak reference is checked for `None` before being used to create the engine, preventing the 'NoneType' errors. This correction should address the issue described in the GitHub report and make the function behave as expected in the failing test.
