### Analysis:
1. The provided buggy function `_engine` in `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` aims to create an engine with a weak reference to `self` (`PeriodIndex`) to avoid reference cycles.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` in `pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py` is testing for monotonicity of levels in a multi-index, which includes periodic index values.
3. The error message mentions an `AttributeError` of 'NoneType' object having no attribute 'view', indicating an issue with accessing an attribute that is expected to be available but is set to `None`.
4. The bug seems to be related to the weak reference used in the `_engine` method, possibly causing the weak reference to be lost prematurely.

### Bug Cause:
The `_engine` function sets up the engine but might be losing the reference to the weakly referenced `self` (`PeriodIndex`), leading to a NoneType issue when accessing attributes later. This loss of reference might occur due to incorrect handling of weak references within the engine setup process.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` (`PeriodIndex`) is maintained properly throughout the lifetime of the engine to avoid premature loss of reference.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    # Store the weakly referenced self object in the engine to prevent early deletion
    engine.period_ref = period
    
    return engine
```

By storing the weak reference in the engine object, we ensure that the reference is maintained as needed. This change should address the premature deletion issue observed in the failing test.
