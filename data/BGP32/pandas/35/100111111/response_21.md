### Analyzing the buggy function and failing test

#### Bug Location:
- The bug is located in the `_engine` function within the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file.
- The error message indicates an issue with the PeriodEngine returning a `NoneType` object instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

#### Bug Cause:
- The `_engine` function is creating a weak reference `period` of `self`, but the weak reference is not maintained properly, leading to the `NoneType` issue.

#### Failing Test Error:
- The failing test is expecting all levels in `idx2` to be monotonic, but due to the internal weak reference issue, the engine is returning `NoneType`, causing the test to fail.

#### Runtime Input/Output:
- The `PeriodIndex(['2019Q1', '2019Q2'])` is passed as an input `self`, and the `_engine` function is expected to return an engine type based on this input.

### Fixing the Bug

#### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` to `self` is correctly maintained throughout the `_engine` function. This will prevent the engine from receiving a `NoneType` and resolve the failing test. 

### Corrected Version

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Maintain a weak reference of self
    if not hasattr(self, '_period_ref'):
        self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    period = self._period_ref
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By correctly storing the weak reference in `self._period_ref` and using it consistently in the `_engine` function, the issue of returning `NoneType` will be resolved. This corrected version should pass the failing test and address the bug reported in the GitHub issue mentioned.
