## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is utilizing weak references to avoid reference cycles but is not handling them correctly, leading to the issue seen in the failing test.
2. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` due to a `NoneType` object not having the attribute `view`.

## Bug Explanation
The bug arises from the weak reference handling in the `_engine` function. When creating the weak reference `period`, there's an issue in how it is then used to instantiate `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. This leads to the engine trying to access an attribute of a `NoneType` object, causing the `AttributeError`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is handled correctly when used to initialize `self._engine_type`. One approach could involve checking if the weak reference `period` is still valid before using it to create the engine, avoiding the issue of a `NoneType` object.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    if period() is not None:  # Check if weakref is still valid
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        # Handle weak reference being invalid, possibly by raising an exception
```

With the corrected version above, the `_engine` function should now handle the weak reference appropriately and prevent the `AttributeError` from occurring, resolving the issue in the failing test.
