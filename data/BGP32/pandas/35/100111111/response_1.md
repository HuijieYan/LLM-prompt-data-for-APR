## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_engine` function where a weak reference to `self` is passed to `_engine_type`. However, the implementation is problematic, leading to an AttributeError in the failing test. The error arises because the weak reference is not properly handling the reference to `self`, resulting in a NoneType object that is unable to perform the necessary operations.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is correctly created and maintained throughout the process. This involves handling the weak reference properly so that it does not become None during the function execution.

## The Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
The corrected version of the `_engine` function is provided below:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    period = period_ref()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By maintaining the `period_ref` weak reference and then obtaining the reference from it as `period`, we ensure that the PeriodIndex `self` is correctly passed to `_engine_type`, resolving the issue of getting a NoneType object.
