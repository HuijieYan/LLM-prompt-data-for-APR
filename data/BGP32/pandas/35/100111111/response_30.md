## Fixing the Bug

### Issue:
The bug occurs because the weak reference `period` created using `weakref.ref(self)` inside the `_engine` function is not preserved correctly, causing the `_engine_type` method to receive a `NoneType` object instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`, resulting in an `AttributeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing:
To resolve this bug, the weak reference to `self` needs to be stored and accessed properly within the `_engine` function to ensure that the `PeriodIndex` is correctly passed to the `_engine_type` method.

### Corrected Code:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference to self to ensure it remains accessible
    self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference to `self` as `self._period_weakref`, it ensures that the `PeriodIndex` is not lost and is correctly passed to the `_engine_type` method, resolving the `NoneType` AttributeError issue.
