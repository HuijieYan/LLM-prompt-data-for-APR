Based on the provided information, the bug seems to be caused by the weak reference to `self` being lost before it is intended to be used in the `_engine_type` function. This results in the `_engine` function returning a `NoneType` object instead of the expected `PeriodEngine`, leading to the AttributeError during the test execution.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until after it is used in the `_engine_type` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Ensure that the weak reference to self is maintained until after it is used in _engine_type
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    return engine
```

By maintaining the weak reference until the engine is created, we prevent the premature loss of the reference and ensure that the `_engine` function returns the expected engine object.

This corrected version should resolve the issue described in the GitHub bug report and pass the failing test.
