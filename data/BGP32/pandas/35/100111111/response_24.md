## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is supposed to return the engine type associated with a PeriodIndex. The error seems to originate from the weak reference usage within the function, specifically in the line `period = weakref.ref(self)`. Weak references are not directly dereferencable; they need to be accessed with `()` like a method to get the referenced object.

The failing test `assert all(x.is_monotonic for x in idx2.levels)` indicates that the issue is related to referencing the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object, as it leads to the error `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, suggesting that the weak reference becomes `None`, causing the issue.

## Bug Explanation
The bug in `_engine` arises from incorrectly applying the weak reference to `self`. The weak reference should be accessed using `()` to retrieve the referenced object. As a result, when `_engine` is called, it returns a weak reference object instead of the intended `self`. This causes subsequent operations on the object to fail with an AttributeError due to trying to access methods on a `NoneType`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the weak reference usage needs to be corrected such that the referenced object is retrieved by calling the weak reference. Therefore, modifying `period = weakref.ref(self)` to `period = weakref.ref(self)()` will ensure that the `PeriodIndex` object is correctly accessed and returned by `_engine`.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By making this correction, the `PeriodIndex` object is correctly passed to the `_engine_type` function, resolving the weak reference issue and allowing subsequent operations on the object to execute without errors.
