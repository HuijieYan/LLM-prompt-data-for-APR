## Identify the Bug
The bug occurs when trying to access the `is_monotonic` property of a `MultiIndex` object, leading to an error mentioning that a 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'. This error originates from the fact that the `_engine` property used in the indexing process is returning `None` instead of the expected `PeriodEngine`.

## Cause of the Bug
The `_engine` function is supposed to create a weak reference to the `self` object (in this case, a `PeriodIndex`) and pass it to `_engine_type` to create the appropriate engine for indexing. However, the weak reference creation is incorrect, leading to `None` being passed as the parameter, causing the subsequent error.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the weak reference creation in the `_engine` function needs to be corrected to ensure a proper reference to the `self` object (PeriodIndex) is passed to `_engine_type`. This will ensure that the `PeriodEngine` is created successfully without any issues.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference properly
    ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(ref, len(self))
```

By making this correction, the weak reference to the `self` object is done correctly, resolving the issue of passing `None` to the `_engine_type` and addressing the error in the failing test.
