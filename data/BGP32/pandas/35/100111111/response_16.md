### Bug Analysis:

1. The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` (PeriodIndex) but is not handling the weak reference properly.
2. The error message indicates an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, suggesting that the weak reference is not being properly utilized.
3. The failing test is checking for monotonicity in the levels of the MultiIndex, but due to the weak reference handling issue in `_engine`, the engine returns `None`, causing the AttributeError.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is retained and properly utilized in the `_engine` function so that it does not become `None`. This will enable the `_engine` function to return the correct engine specified in the PeriodEngine class.

### Corrected Function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By changing `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))` to `return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))`, we're explicitly calling `period()` to get the referenced object. This modification ensures that the weak reference is properly managed, preventing it from becoming `None`.

After applying this fix, the corrected function should handle the weak reference and avoid the AttributeError, allowing the failing test to pass successfully.
