## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` utilizes weak referencing to avoid reference cycles but there seems to be an issue with how the reference is handled.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` from `PeriodIndex` values and then checks if the resulting levels are monotonic, triggering the bug in `_engine`.
3. The error message indicates an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, signifying that something is attempting to access an attribute on a `None` object, likely due to the weak referencing in the `_engine` function.
4. The bug seems to be caused by the weak reference not maintaining the reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance properly within the `_engine` function.
5. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is handled properly to maintain the reference to the `PeriodIndex` object.

## Correction
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))  # Use weak reference correctly
```

By correcting the way the weak reference is utilized within the `_engine` function, we ensure that the reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance is properly maintained, resolving the `NoneType` error observed in the failing test.

This correction should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and allow the failing test to pass as expected.
