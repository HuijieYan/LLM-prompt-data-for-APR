### Explanation of the Bug:
The bug is occurring in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The error message indicates an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, pointing to an issue in accessing an attribute of a `NoneType` object. This is likely caused by the weak reference to the `self` object (`PeriodIndex`) being lost before it is passed to `_engine_type`.

When `period = weakref.ref(self)` is executed, it creates a weak reference to `self`. However, if there are no other strong references to `self` in the code, `self` might be garbage collected, leading to the weak reference holding a reference to `None`. This results in the `_engine` function returning `None` instead of the expected `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.

### Fix Strategy:
To solve this bug, we need to ensure that a strong reference to `self` is maintained throughout the `_engine` function. One way to achieve this is to create a local variable that stores a direct reference to `self` before creating the weak reference. By doing so, we keep `self` alive during the function's execution, preventing it from being garbage collected prematurely.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Ensure a strong reference to self is maintained
    local_self = self
    period = weakref.ref(local_self)
    return local_self._engine_type(period, len(local_self))
```

By making this change, we ensure that `self` is kept alive until it is passed to `_engine_type`, preventing the `NoneType` error caused by premature garbage collection. This correction addresses the bug and should resolve the failing test case.
