## Bug Explanation

The bug occurs in the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class. The method returns an instance of `_engine_type`, passing a weak reference of `self` (which is the `PeriodIndex` object) as an argument. The issue arises when using this weak reference inside the `_engine_type`, where it ends up being `NoneType` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex` instance, causing the AttributeError during the subsequent operations.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is correctly handled inside the `_engine_type` to avoid getting `NoneType`. One potential strategy is to modify the `_engine_type` implementation to properly extract the weak reference and obtain the original `PeriodIndex` object before proceeding with further operations.

## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function in pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    # Extract the actual PeriodIndex object from the weak reference
    period = weak_period()
    
    # Check if the weak reference resolved correctly
    if period is None:
        raise ValueError("Weak reference resolved to None")
    
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By modifying the `_engine` function to extract and validate the weak reference correctly, we ensure that we always have a valid `PeriodIndex` object to work with inside the `_engine_type`. This fix should address the AttributeError happening due to a `NoneType` object being accessed.
