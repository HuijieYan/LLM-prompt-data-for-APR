### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using weak references to avoid reference cycles.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is trying to check if all levels in `idx2` are monotonic, triggering an error related to `PeriodEngine`.
3. The error message indicates an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, suggesting a problem with the reference to `PeriodEngine`.
4. The GitHub issue describes the exact scenario leading to this bug, where weak references are dropped prematurely.
   
### Bug Cause
The bug occurs due to weak references being dropped early, leading to `None` being passed to `PeriodEngine`, causing an `AttributeError`.

### Suggested Fix
To fix this bug, we need to ensure proper handling of weak references and prevent them from being dropped prematurely. This can be achieved by modifying the `_engine` function to maintain the weak reference until its last use.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self), self)
```

By passing `self` along with the weak reference, we ensure that the reference is not dropped prematurely, resolving the issue.
