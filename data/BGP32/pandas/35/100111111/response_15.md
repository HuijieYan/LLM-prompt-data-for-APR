## Bug Explanation

The bug occurs due to the weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` being stored in a local variable `period` within the `_engine()` function. When `self` is subsequently passed to `_engine_type()` as `period`, it's treated as a weak reference, leading to unexpected behavior.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods()` fails because when trying to access the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` levels in the `idx2` object, the `PeriodEngine` tries to access the weak reference which is now `None`, resulting in the `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is correctly maintained throughout the `_engine()` function and is accessed properly when needed without being converted to `None`. One way to achieve this is to directly pass the weak reference to `_engine_type()` itself, ensuring it retains its weakly referenced nature.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```

By directly passing `weakref.ref(self)` to `_engine_type()`, we maintain the weak reference for `self` throughout the function, preventing it from unintentionally becoming `None`. This fix ensures that the weakly referenced object is correctly used by the `_engine_type` without any attribute errors.
