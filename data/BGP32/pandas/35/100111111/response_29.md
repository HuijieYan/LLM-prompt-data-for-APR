## Bug Fix Strategy
The bug occurs due to a weak reference not being correctly retained for the `PeriodIndex` leading to an attribute error. To fix this, we need to ensure that the weak reference is correctly retained throughout the process, maintaining the reference to `self` in the `PeriodEngine`. 

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

## Explanation
In the original `_engine` function, the weakref to `self` was not correctly resolved, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `NoneType` object leading to the attribute error. By correcting the function to call `period()` inside `_engine_type`, we ensure that the weak reference is resolved correctly to retain the reference to the `PeriodIndex`, preventing the attribute error.

This fix addresses the issue raised in the GitHub report by retaining the weak reference as intended and ensuring that the function correctly returns the expected output through proper handling of weak references.
