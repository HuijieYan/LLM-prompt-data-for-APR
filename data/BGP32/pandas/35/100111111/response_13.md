## Bug Explanation

The bug in the `_engine` function arises because a weak reference to `self` is mistakenly passed to `_engine_type` causing the weakly referenced `period` object to become None instead of the intended PeriodIndex. This results in an AttributeError when trying to access `view()` on a NoneType object, triggering the failing test.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix this bug, the weak reference implementation needs to be adjusted to ensure that the reference to `self` as a PeriodIndex is maintained properly when passed to `_engine_type`. This will prevent the weakly referenced object from becoming None.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self._values)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By correcting the weak reference implementation in the `_engine` function to refer to `self._values` instead of just `self`, the bug causing the AttributeError will be fixed. This change ensures that a strong reference to the PeriodIndex object is maintained correctly, resolving the failing test.
