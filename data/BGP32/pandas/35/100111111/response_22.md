### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `@cache_readonly` method returning a engine type based on the `self` reference.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` tries to verify if all level values of a MultiIndex `idx2` are monotonic, but it encounters an `AttributeError` regarding the `NoneType` object in the `_engine` method.
3. The failing test is due to the weak reference `period` being implemented incorrectly, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correct how the weak reference is passed in the `_engine` method and ensure that a valid `PeriodIndex` reference is received by the `PeriodEngine`.

### Bug Fix
```python
from pandas.core.indexes.period import PeriodEngine

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return PeriodEngine(self, len(self))
```

By directly passing `self` to the `PeriodEngine` without using `weakref`, we ensure that the `PeriodEngine` method receives the correct `PeriodIndex` instance.
