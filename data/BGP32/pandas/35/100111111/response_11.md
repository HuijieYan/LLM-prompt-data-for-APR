Based on the analysis provided, the bug in the `_engine` function is due to the weak reference `period` being created but not utilized correctly. The error message indicates an issue with a `NoneType` object not having the attribute `view`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is correctly passed to `_engine_type` without losing reference to the `PeriodIndex` object.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By fixing the function in this way, the weak reference is correctly converted back to the `PeriodIndex` object before being passed to `_engine_type`, preventing the error caused by a `NoneType` object. This correction should align with the expected input/output values and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
