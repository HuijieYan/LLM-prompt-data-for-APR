### Analysis:
The error message indicates an AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'. This implies that the `_engine` function is returning None, causing the subsequent error in the test function.

### Error:
The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference, but instead of returning the weakly referenced object, it returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` which could potentially lead to a NoneType object.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `_engine` function not returning the expected weakly referenced object but rather trying to use `self._engine_type` directly, leading to a potential NoneType object.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should return the weakly referenced object obtained from the `period` variable.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return period
```

By returning the `period` variable, which holds a weak reference, ensures that the weakly referenced object is returned and not None. This should resolve the AttributeError issue in the failing test.
