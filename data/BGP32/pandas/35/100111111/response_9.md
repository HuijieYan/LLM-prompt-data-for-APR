Based on the analysis of the buggy function, the error message, runtime values, and expected values, we can see that the issue is originating from the `_engine` function not properly handling the weak reference to `self`. This leads to a `NoneType` error when trying to access the `view` attribute.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly handled within the `_engine` function. We should modify the function to properly maintain the weak reference to `self` and correctly create the engine type.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By invoking `period()` in the corrected function, we are obtaining the proper reference to `self`, resolving the issue of passing a `NoneType` to the engine type. This modification should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
