## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is decorated with `@cache_readonly`, indicating that the function should be memoized and only computed once.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` fails due to an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` when checking if all objects in `idx2.levels` are monotonic.
3. The issue revolves around weak referencing `self` in the method `_engine`, which leads to the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of `PeriodIndex`. This situation arises during memoization.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained correctly throughout memoization and avoid dropping it prematurely.

## Bug Fix
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    if not hasattr(self, '_period_ref'):
        self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    
    period = self._period_ref()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By this fix, we address the premature dropping of the weak reference to `self` in the `_engine` function. We check if the weak reference exists and create it if not, ensuring proper memoization for subsequent calls.
