Based on the analysis, the bug occurs because the `_engine` function in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file is not correctly handling weak references. In the failing test, the error message indicates that a 'NoneType' object is being encountered when trying to access the 'view' attribute, which leads to an AttributeError.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference handling is correct in the `_engine` function. Here is a corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
    return engine
```

In this correction, we first call `period()` on the weak reference to obtain the actual object it refers to, before passing it to `_engine_type`. This ensures that the weak reference is correctly resolved to the object being referenced.

By making this change, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and avoid the 'NoneType' object AttributeError issue encountered in the original buggy version.
