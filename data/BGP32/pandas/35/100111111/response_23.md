## Analysis
1. The buggy function is `_engine(self)` within the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` from `pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py` is attempting to check if all levels of the MultiIndex `idx2` are monotonic.
3. The error message is `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, indicating that the PeriodEngine is getting a None object instead of the expected PeriodIndex.
4. The cause of the bug is that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex (`period`) is being dropped prematurely, leading to a `NoneType` object being passed to the `_engine_type` constructor.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex persists until it is used in the `_engine_type` constructor.

## Bug Fix
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the fixed version, `period()` is called right before passing it to `_engine_type`, ensuring that the weak reference does not get discarded prematurely. This change should resolve the `NoneType` issue and allow the test to pass successfully.
