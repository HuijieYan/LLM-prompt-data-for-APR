## Bug Explanation

The bug is related to the `_engine` method in the `pandas.core.indexes.period` module. The error occurs when accessing the `is_monotonic` attribute in the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods`. The failing test is attempting to check if all levels in `idx2` are monotonic, but an `AttributeError` is thrown with the message `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.

The cause of this bug is that the weak reference `period` created by `weakref.ref(self)` is not being correctly handled. This leads to the `_engine_type` method receiving `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex` instance when trying to access the `is_monotonic_increasing` attribute, resulting in the `AttributeError`.

## Fix Strategy

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is transformed back into a strong reference before passing it to the `_engine_type` method. This will prevent the `_engine` method from returning `None` when called.

## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` instead of `period`, we convert the weak reference back to a strong reference before passing it to `_engine_type`. This ensures that the `_engine` method correctly returns the expected `PeriodIndex` instance, fixing the bug.
