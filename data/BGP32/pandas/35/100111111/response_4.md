## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `_engine` function in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file is returning a NoneType object instead of the expected `PeriodEngine` object. This issue leads to an AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute on a NoneType object in the failing test, resulting in the failing test.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine` function returns a valid `PeriodEngine` object instead of a NoneType object. This can be achieved by investigating why the `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` call results in a None value and correcting it to return a valid `PeriodEngine` object.

## The corrected version of the `_engine` function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine if engine is not None else self._engine_type()
```

By checking if the `engine` object is None before returning, we ensure that a valid `PeriodEngine` object is always returned by the `_engine` function. This correction should resolve the AttributeError and make the failing test pass.
