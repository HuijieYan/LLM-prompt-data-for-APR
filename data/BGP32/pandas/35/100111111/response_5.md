## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The function attempts to create a weak reference `period` to the `self` object and then uses it to initialize an `_engine_type` object. However, due to the weak reference setup, the weak reference `period` is being cleaned up unexpectedly, leading to a `NoneType` error when trying to access attributes of the weak reference.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` in `test_get_level_values.py` tries to perform operations involving the `is_monotonic` attribute of levels in the `idx2` MultiIndex. This operation leads to the call chain ending up in the buggy `_engine` function, which then fails due to the weak reference issue.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` remains alive during the object initialization in the `_engine` function. One way to achieve this is by directly passing the `self` object to the `_engine_type`. This will maintain a strong reference to `self` during the initialization of `_engine_type` object, preventing premature cleanup of the weak reference.

## Corrected Code
```python
# The corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By passing `self` directly instead of using a weak reference, we establish a strong reference, resolving the issue caused by premature cleanup of the weak reference. This change should fix the bug and ensure that the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` passes successfully.
