## Analysis
The bug occurs when trying to access the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` in the `_engine` function. The error message indicates that a `NoneType` object is being accessed for the `view` attribute, likely due to the weak reference not being properly maintained. This leads to unexpected behavior when accessing the `PeriodEngine`.

## Bug Explanation
The bug arises from the fact that the weak reference might not be correctly maintained, causing the `_engine` function to return `None` instead of the expected `PeriodEngine` instance. This issue is triggered when trying to access the `view` attribute on the `PeriodEngine`, resulting in an `AttributeError`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference within the `_engine` function correctly refers to the `self` object without losing the reference prematurely. By adjusting how the weak reference is handled, we can ensure that the `PeriodEngine` instance is properly created and returned.

## Bug-fixed Function
```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine if engine is not None else self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By checking if the `engine` is `None` after creation, we can ensure that a valid `PeriodEngine` instance is returned. This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and make the failing test pass.
