## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is attempting to create a weak reference to `self` (presumably a `PeriodEngine` instance) and then pass it to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`.
2. The error message indicates that an `AttributeError` occurs due to a `NoneType` object not having the attribute `view`.
3. The failing test is related to checking if all levels of the MultiIndex created are monotonic. The bug seems to prevent the proper construction of the `PeriodEngine`, leading to a `NoneType` error.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference created properly and is accessible within the `_engine` method.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the weak reference is correctly created and maintained within the `_engine` method. This way, the reference to the `PeriodIndex` won't be lost prematurely, causing the `NoneType` error.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In this corrected version, `period()` is used to retrieve the referenced object, maintaining the weak reference throughout the `_engine` method's execution. This change should resolve the `NoneType` error and allow the test to pass successfully.
