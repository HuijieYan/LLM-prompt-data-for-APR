### Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_engine` function, which is trying to create a weak reference to `self` but is not handling it correctly, leading to the error message. The failing test is checking for monotonicity in the levels of an index, and the bug prevents it from accessing the necessary information, resulting in an `AttributeError`.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises because when the `weakref.ref(self)` line is executed, the return value is assigned to `period`, but it is not retained for use in the subsequent return statement. This causes the weak reference to be lost before it can be utilized.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference created is maintained for the duration it is needed. We can achieve this by storing the weak reference object within an attribute of the object itself so that it remains available for subsequent operations.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    self._weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._weak_period, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we have added a new attribute `_weak_period` to the object, storing the weak reference to `self`. This change ensures that the weak reference is accessible when needed, resolving the bug identified in the failing test.
