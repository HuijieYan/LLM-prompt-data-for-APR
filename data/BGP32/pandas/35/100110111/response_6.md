To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained correctly throughout the function. The error is occurring because the weak reference `period` is being lost before it is used to create the engine instance.

Here's a corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)).view("i8")
```

Explanation of the bug:
1. The original implementation was missing the `.view("i8")` method call on the returned engine instance.
2. This missing method call resulted in the engine object being `None` instead of the expected view type, causing the AttributeError during execution.
3. By appending the `.view("i8")` method call to the returned engine instance, we ensure that it has the correct type and resolves the issue.

With this correction, the function should now correctly return the engine instance with the proper view type, preventing the AttributeError from occurring during execution.
