## Step 1: Analyzing the buggy function and failing test

The buggy function `_engine` is attempting to create a weak reference to `self` (which is a `PeriodIndex`), pass it to `_engine_type`, and then return the result. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is testing the monotonicity of levels in a `MultiIndex` constructed from a `PeriodIndex`.

The error message indicates an `AttributeError` due to a `NoneType` object lacking the `view` attribute, pointing to a problem with the weak referencing approach.

## Step 2: Identifying potential error locations

The issue is likely with how the weak reference is being handled and not maintained properly, leading to a `NoneType` issue at a later stage.

## Step 3: Explaining the cause of the bug

The bug occurs because the weak reference to `self` is not being maintained correctly within the `_engine` function, resulting in the `_PeriodEngine` object receiving a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`, leading to the `AttributeError`.

## Step 4: Strategy for fixing the bug

To resolve the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly managed and maintained within the `_engine` function so that it does not result in a `NoneType` issue.

## Step 5: Corrected version of the function

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Using weakref.proxy to maintain the weak reference appropriately
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, we can maintain the weak reference to `self` correctly. This adjustment ensures that the `_engine` function works as intended without causing the `None` object attribute issues.

After applying this correction, running the failing test should no longer produce the `AttributeError`, and the expected output value should be achieved.
