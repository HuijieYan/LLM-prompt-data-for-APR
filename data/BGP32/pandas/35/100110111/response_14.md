### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` decorator that is intended to avoid reference cycles by creating a weak reference to `self` before calling `_engine_type` with the weak reference and the length of `self`.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` with a `PeriodIndex` and tries to assert that all levels in the resulting `MultiIndex` are monotonic.
3. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` where a `NoneType` object has no attribute 'view'.
4. The bug seems to stem from a weak reference that is not properly handled, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `NoneType` object.
5. We should ensure that the weak reference to `self` in the `_engine` function is correctly handled to avoid passing a `NoneType` to the `PeriodEngine`.

### Correction:
```python
from pandas.core.indexes import PeriodEngine

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))()  # Call the weak reference to get the actual object

```

By modifying the `_engine` function to call the weak reference to get the actual object (using `()`), we ensure that the weak reference is resolved before passing it to the `PeriodEngine`, avoiding the `NoneType` issue.
