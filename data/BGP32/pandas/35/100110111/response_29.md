## Analyzing the buggy function and failing test:

### Buggy Function (_engine):
1. The function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` decorated function in the file `pandas/core/indexes/period.py`.
2. The function creates a weak reference `period` to the `self` object and then returns the result of calling `_engine_type` with `period` and the length of `self`.
3. The function is intended to prevent reference cycles by using weak references.

### Failing Test (test_get_level_values_when_periods):
1. The test sets up a MultiIndex with PeriodIndex elements and tries to check monotonicity properties.
2. During the test, an attribute error occurs related to a 'NoneType' object not having the attribute 'view'.
3. The test asserts that all levels of the MultiIndex are monotonic.

### Error Message:
The error message states that a 'NoneType' does not have the attribute 'view', indicating an issue with accessing an attribute from an object that might be `None`.

### Expected Values:
In the failing test execution, the `idx._get_level_values(level)` call might be returning `None`, leading to the subsequent attribute error.

### GitHub Issue:
The GitHub issue reflects a problem where weak references are lost when copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving a `None` instead of the intended PeriodIndex.

## Bug Cause and Strategy for Fixing:
The bug seems to stem from the `_engine` function using a weak reference approach to avoid reference cycles. However, there might be an issue in how the weak reference is utilized, possibly leading to a `None` object being returned instead of the expected object during the failing test.
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is correctly handled and the appropriate object is returned when accessing the weak reference.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    if period is None:  # Check if weakref returns None
        return self._engine_type(self, len(self))  # Return the object itself
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))  # Return the weak reference
```

By modifying the `_engine` function to handle cases where the weak reference returns `None`, we can ensure that the correct object is utilized, thus resolving the issue seen in the failing test.
