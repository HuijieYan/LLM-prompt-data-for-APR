## Analyzing the buggy function and failing test:

### Buggy Function:
The `_engine` function is decorated with `@cache_readonly` and utilizes weak referencing with `weakref.ref(self)` to avoid reference cycles. However, it returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, where the weak reference may not be maintained correctly.

### Failing Test:
The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` and attempts to check if the levels are monotonic. The test fails due to an AttributeError related to the `PeriodEngine` object not having the attribute 'view'.

### Issue and Expected Values:
The GitHub issue notes that weak referencing for `PeriodIndex` may be lost, leading to incorrect behavior when accessing the `PeriodEngine`. The expected values indicate the types and contents of `self._values` and `self` parameters.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug arises from the weak referencing implementation in `_engine`, potentially resulting in `self` being inaccessible or incorrectly referenced in subsequent operations, leading to an AttributeError in the failing test.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, ensure that the weakly referenced `self` is correctly maintained and accessible throughout the `_engine` function. This may involve revisiting how `period` is created and utilized within `_engine`.

## Updated Function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of period instead of self directly.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

With this adjustment, the weakly referenced `period` is executed to retrieve a direct reference to `self` when invoking `self._engine_type`, addressing potential issues related to weak referencing loss.

This correction ensures that the weak reference is correctly resolved to access the required attributes of `self` within the `_engine` function, resolving the bug causing the AttributeError during the failing test.
