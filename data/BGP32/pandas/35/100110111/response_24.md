### Analyzing the buggy function and failing test
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object and passing it to `_engine_type` to avoid a reference cycle.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` from `pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py` is checking if all levels of a `MultiIndex` created from `Period` objects are monotonic.
3. The failing test is encountering an `AttributeError` because the `_engine` method is returning a `NoneType` object that lacks the `view` attribute, which is required in the `is_monotonic_increasing` method called during the test execution.
4. To fix the bug, the `_engine` method should return a valid engine object to prevent the `NoneType` return that causes the error.

### Suggestions for fixing the bug
To correct the bug, the `_engine` method should ensure that a valid engine object is returned to prevent the `AttributeError`. It might involve checking the `_engine_type` creation and ensuring that it correctly handles the weak reference.

### Corrected Buggy Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        return self._engine_type(self._values, len(self))  # Fallback if engine is None
    return engine
```

By implementing this corrected version of the `_engine` method, the bug should be fixed, and the failing test should pass successfully, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the GitHub issue mentioned.
