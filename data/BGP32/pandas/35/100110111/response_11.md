### Analysis:
1. The `is_monotonic` function tries to access `self._engine.is_monotonic_increasing`, which eventually leads to the buggy `_engine` function being called.
2. The bug causes an `AttributeError` due to a `NoneType` object being accessed for the `view` attribute.
3. The expected input values include a `PeriodArray` and a `PeriodIndex` type object.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `_engine` function does not properly return the expected `PeriodEngine` object, leading to a `NoneType` object being accessed later in the code.

### Fix Strategy:
Ensure that the `_engine` function returns the correct `PeriodEngine` object instead of causing a reference cycle issue.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self)._get_object(), len(self))
```

By accessing the correct object from the weak reference, we can prevent the `NoneType` error and return the expected `PeriodEngine` object.
