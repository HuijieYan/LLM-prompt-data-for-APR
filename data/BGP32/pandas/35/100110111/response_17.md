## Analyze the buggy function and failing test

1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` decorator function that aims to avoid reference cycles by passing a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` object with `PeriodIndex` levels and checks if the levels are monotonic.
3. The error occurs in the failing test when checking for monotonicity due to an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.
4. The expected input/output values are provided for the relevant variables during the failing test execution.
5. The GitHub issue states that copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` loses weak references, resulting in the `NoneType` error.

## Bug in the buggy function
The bug in the `_engine` function is related to the weak reference implementation. The weak reference to `self` (`PeriodIndex`) is not preserved correctly, leading to `NoneType` errors, as observed in the failing test.

## Fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is properly maintained within the `_engine` function to prevent reference cycles, as described in the GitHub issue.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weak_period, len(self))
```
