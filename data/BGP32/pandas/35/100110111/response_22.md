## Analyzing the buggy function and failing test
The buggy function `_engine` in the file `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` is attempting to create a weak reference to `self` and then call `self._engine_type` with the weak reference and the length of `self` as arguments. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` in the file `pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py` is testing if the level values of a MultiIndex composed of PeriodIndex objects are monotonic.

### Potential Error Locations
1. The usage of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference might not be functioning as intended.
2. The passing of the weak reference `period` to `self._engine_type` could be incorrect.
3. A problem in the implementation of `_engine_type` itself.

### Cause of the Bug
The error message indicates an `AttributeError` at a point where the engine is expecting a view attribute that is missing, leading to a `NoneType` error. This suggests that the weak referencing operation may not be providing the intended reference and causing issues when accessing the view.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To address the bug, we need to ensure that the weak referencing is correctly implemented to avoid the `NoneType` error during attribute access within the `_engine` function. Adjustments within the weak referencing operation or the way `self._engine_type` interacts with the weak reference might be necessary.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use weakref.proxy instead of weakref.ref
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By utilizing `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, the corrected function should establish the weak reference needed for the subsequent operations to function properly. This adjustment aims to overcome the `NoneType` attribute error observed in the failing test.
