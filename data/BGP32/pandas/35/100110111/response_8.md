### Analysis:
1. The provided buggy function `_engine` utilizes weak references to avoid reference cycles but appears to contain an error causing it to return `NoneType`.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` tests the behavior of `is_monotonic` on a MultiIndex with periods but fails due to the buggy function `_engine`.
3. The error occurs due to the `_engine_type` method receiving a weakly referenced `period` which is not correctly handled, leading to a `NoneType` object being returned, causing attribute errors during the test.
4. To fix the bug, the `_engine_type` method should handle the weak reference properly and retrieve the desired PeriodIndex consistently.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `_engine` function to correctly handle weak references and ensure the PeriodIndex is appropriately passed to `_engine_type`.
2. Adjust the weak reference usage in `_engine` to prevent the creation of `NoneType` objects.
3. Update the `_engine_type` method to utilize the weak reference correctly and return the expected PeriodIndex instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

In this corrected version, the weak reference usage has been adjusted to prevent the creation of `NoneType` objects and ensure the `_engine_type` method receives the appropriate reference. This fix should resolve the attribute errors encountered in the failing test and align with the expected input/output values.
