### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a cacheable readonly function that returns an engine type based on weak reference to the `self` parameter. In this case, it returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` tries to check if all values are monotonic, but it fails due to an attribute error `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.

### Error Cause:
1. The error occurs because the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object is potentially dropped before being utilized in the `PeriodEngine` object for checking monotonicity.
2. The engine being returned might not have the necessary reference when accessed, leading to the `NoneType` error.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we should ensure that the weak reference `period` is preserved throughout the `_engine` method execution to correctly maintain the reference to the `self` object.

### Corrected Code:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Ensure period reference is preserved throughout this method
    weak_period = period()
    return self._engine_type(weak_period, len(self))
```

By modifying the `_engine` method to create a weak reference to `self` and retain it as `weak_period` while retrieving the `engine_type`, we ensure that the weak reference is properly utilized without getting prematurely dropped, fixing the AttributeError issue.
