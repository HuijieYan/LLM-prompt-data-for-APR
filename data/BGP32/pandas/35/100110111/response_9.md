### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is utilizing `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` for avoiding reference cycles.
2. The error message shows that the `PeriodEngine` is receiving a `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`, leading to an `AttributeError` when trying to access an attribute from `None`.
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is asserting the monotonicity of levels in a `MultiIndex`, which internally interacts with the `_engine` function, causing the error due to a weak reference issue.
4. To fix this bug, the weak referencing mechanism must be adjusted to ensure that the `_engine` function correctly receives the `PeriodIndex` instance without getting `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the weak reference creation process to ensure that the weak reference does not lose track of the `self` object.
2. Update the `_engine` function logic to pass the correct reference to `PeriodEngine` without any `None` values.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use weakref.proxy to prevent losing reference to self
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
