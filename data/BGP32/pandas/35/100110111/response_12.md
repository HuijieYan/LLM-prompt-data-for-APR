## Analysis
1. The `is_monotonic` method in the failing test refers to the `is_monotonic_increasing` method that ultimately accesses `self._engine.is_monotonic_increasing`, which leads to the bug.
2. The `_engine` method in the buggy function creates a weak reference to the `self` object, but due to potential issues in weak reference handling, the `_engine_type` constructor receives `None` instead of the intended reference.
3. The error message indicates that a `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, which suggests that the weak reference setup in `_engine_type` is faulty, leading to a `NoneType` propagation error.
4. To fix the bug, ensure that the weak reference handling is correct so that the intended reference is passed to `_engine_type`.

## Updated Buggy Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self)) if period_ref() is not None else self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By checking if the weak reference is not `None` before accessing it in the return statement, we ensure that a valid reference is passed to `_engine_type`.

This correction should resolve the weak reference issue and prevent the `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error.
