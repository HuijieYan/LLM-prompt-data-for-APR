## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is trying to create a weak reference of `self` and then pass it to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`. However, the issue arises when trying to access the weak reference in the `PeriodEngine` class because it ends up with a `NoneType` object instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is trying to check if all the levels in `idx2` MultiIndex are monotonic, but it fails due to the issue with weak references of PeriodIndex levels being dropped.

The specific error encountered is an `AttributeError` indicating that a `NoneType` object has no attribute `view`. This occurs in the `_do_monotonic_check` method of `IndexEngine` when trying to get the index values.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `PeriodIndex` is maintained and accessible when needed. One way to achieve this is to store the weak reference in an instance attribute within the `_engine` function, making sure it's available when checking for monotonicity.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

This fix will preserve the weak reference to `self` within the instance, ensuring that it is not prematurely dropped.

This corrected version should address the weak reference issue and allow the failing test to pass as expected.
