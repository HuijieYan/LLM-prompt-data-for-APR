### Analysis
- The buggy function `_engine(self)` has a decorator `@cache_readonly`, which suggests that it caches the result for future calls.
- In the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods()`, it creates a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex`, then uses `is_monotonic` on the resulting index, which requires access to the `_engine` property of the index.
- The failing test error occurs because when `_engine` is called, the `weakref` reference `period` might be causing the issue.
- The failing test expects the `is_monotonic` property to be checked successfully without any errors.

### Bug Cause
- The bug seems to be caused by the `weakref` reference `period` inside the `_engine` method. When accessing `_engine`, it may lead to `NoneType` attribute errors as it's weakly referenced.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference does not cause the `NoneType` error.
- We can consider removing the weak reference or handling it better inside the function.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By removing the `weakref` reference from the function, the corrected version should now pass the failing test and prevent the `NoneType` attribute error.
