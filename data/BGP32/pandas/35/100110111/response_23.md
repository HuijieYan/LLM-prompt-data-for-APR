### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using weakref to create a weak reference to self, which is a PeriodIndex object, and then passes this weak reference to `_engine_type` along with the length of the PeriodIndex.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a MultiIndex from a list of Period indices and then tries to check if all levels are monotonic.
3. The failing test triggers an AttributeError while trying to check monotonicity due to the weak reference not being handled properly in `_engine`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference created in `_engine` is properly utilized by `_engine_type` and does not result in a NoneType error.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the weak reference in `_engine` not being handled correctly, leading to a NoneType error when accessing it in `_engine_type`, as observed in the failing test and the AttributeError message.

### Correction Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the handling of weak references in the `_engine` function to ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex object is accessible when needed. This should prevent the NoneType error and enable the proper functioning of the `_engine` method.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Using weakref.ref to create a weak reference to self
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    
    # Check that the referenced object is available before accessing it
    period = period_ref() if period_ref is not None else self
    
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By updating the `_engine` function to handle weak references correctly by checking for None and accessing the referenced object when needed, we can ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex object is maintained as expected. This correction should address the bug and prevent the AttributeError encountered in the failing test.
