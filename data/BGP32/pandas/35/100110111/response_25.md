After analyzing the buggy function and failing test, it is clear that the bug arises due to a weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before intended within the `_engine` method in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file. This results in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `NoneType` object instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until it is used within the `_engine` method. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference object within a local variable that persists within the scope of the method until the `self._engine_type` method is called.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

By creating a `period_ref` variable to store the weak reference object and returning it to the `_engine_type` method when needed, we ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained throughout the `_engine` method's execution.

This correction should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test successfully pass.
