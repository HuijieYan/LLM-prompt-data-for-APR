## Analyzing the buggy function and failing test:

The buggy function `_engine(self)` in the code is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self` and then passing it to `_engine_type` function. However, the error message indicates that `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, which suggests that the weak reference might not be working as intended. Also, the failing test is related to handling `PeriodIndex` objects within a `MultiIndex`. This issue has been identified on GitHub with the title "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs".

## Identified potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The creation of the weak reference might not work as expected.
2. The passing of the weak reference to `_engine_type` might be causing a problem.

## Cause of the bug:
The weak reference created using `weakref.ref` might not be preserving the reference correctly, leading to the observed `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error. This issue is particularly significant when dealing with `PeriodIndex` objects within a `MultiIndex`.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly maintained and accessed within the `_engine` function. Additionally, the handling of the weak reference in relation to `_engine_type` needs to be reviewed to address the error encountered in the failing test.

## Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Check if the weak reference object is not None before passing to _engine_type
    if period():
        return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
    
    # If the weak reference is None, handle the case appropriately (return None/raise an error, depending on the requirements)
    return None
```

By incorporating a check for `None` in the weak reference retrieval before passing it to `_engine_type`, we can address the issue of accessing attributes on a `NoneType` object. This correction aims to ensure that the weak reference is correctly maintained throughout the function execution.
