## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is trying to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object self and then instantiate an engine type using that weak reference. The bug seems to occur due to the weak reference not being properly maintained or accessed within the engine type operation.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` with `PeriodIndex` levels and checks if all levels are monotonic. However, due to the bug in the `_engine` function, the weak reference handling is incorrect, leading to an AttributeError when checking if the levels are monotonic.

The expected input values include `self._values` and `self`, which are relevant to creating the `PeriodEngine` correctly within the `_engine` function.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the weak reference `period` created using `weakref.ref(self)` is not being properly accessed or utilized within the `_engine_type` function, leading to a NoneType object being accessed which results in an AttributeError.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference created using `weakref.ref(self)` is correctly accessed and used within the `_engine_type` function. This requires a proper method to retrieve the reference from the weak reference object.

## Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` instead of just `period`, we properly retrieve the referenced object from the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`, ensuring that the weak reference is correctly handled. This corrected version should address the AttributeError issue and pass the failing test.
