## Fixing the buggy function

### Issue Analysis:
- The error occurs when trying to access the `view` attribute on a `NoneType` object in the `_do_monotonic_check` method of the `IndexEngine`.
- The cause of this bug is that the `_engine` method in the `PeriodEngine` class is returning a weak reference (`weakref.ref`) instead of the actual object reference.

### Fix Strategy:
- Modify the `_engine` method to return the actual object reference instead of a weak reference.
- Ensure that the correct object reference is passed to the `_engine_type` constructor.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Return the direct reference to self instead of a weak reference
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By making this change and returning the direct reference to the object in the `_engine` method, the bug should be fixed, and the corrected function will pass the failing test as expected.
