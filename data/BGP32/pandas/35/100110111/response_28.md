### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a cached read-only property that returns the engine of the PeriodIndex based on weak references.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` utilizes `idx2.levels` to check monotonicity, which in turn calls the `is_monotonic` method from the engine.
3. The error occurs due to the engine receiving a `NoneType` object instead of a PeriodIndex, leading to an `AttributeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is correctly maintained in the `_engine` property.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Make sure the weak reference stored in the `period` variable is maintained properly throughout the `_engine` method.
2. Ensure that the weakly referenced `self` is passed to `_engine_type` as intended.

### Corrected Buggy Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function _engine
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By correctly passing `period()` instead of `period` to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the weak reference is resolved to the original object before passing it to the engine.

With this correction, the `_engine` function should now maintain the weak reference correctly and resolve any `NoneType` issues encountered in the failing test.
