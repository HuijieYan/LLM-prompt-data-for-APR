## Analysis
1. The function `_engine` seems to create a weak reference to `self` (presumably a `PeriodIndex` object) and then calls `_engine_type` with this weak reference and the length of `self`. The error message points to an issue when calling `view("i8") on `self._engine` during `is_monotonic_increasing`.
2. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` because a `NoneType` object does not have the attribute `view`.
3. The failing test, as per GitHub issue GH33131, suggests that copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` loses weakrefs, leading to the incorrect behavior of the `_engine` method.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly handled and not lost before being used within the `_engine_type` function.
5. We need to modify the `_engine` function to correctly handle the weak reference.

## Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Make a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Retrieve the strong reference from the weakref
    strong_ref = period()
    if strong_ref is not None:
        return self._engine_type(strong_ref, len(self))
    return None
```

By storing the strong reference from the weak reference before using it, we ensure that the expected behavior is preserved and the error from the failing test is resolved.
