### Analysis:
1. The `_engine` function is decorated with `@cache_readonly`, implying that it should only be computed once and then cached.
2. The error message indicates an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, suggesting that the `_engine` object is not properly initialized.
3. The `self._engine_type` call inside the `_engine` function likely fails to correctly initialize the engine.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the fact that the `weakref.ref` call on `self` inside the `_engine` function is insufficient for maintaining a reference to `self`. This leads to `_engine_type` receiving a `None` object instead of a valid reference to `self`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self` is properly maintained throughout the `_engine` function, preventing it from being prematurely garbage collected. We can achieve this by storing a strong reference to `self` before passing a weak reference to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a strong reference to self to avoid garbage collection
    period = self
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(period), len(period))
```
