## Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class, leading to an `AttributeError` when trying to access an attribute on a `NoneType` object. This error arises during the test case `test_get_level_values_when_periods` when checking `is_monotonic` for levels in `idx2`.

The issue mentioned on GitHub explains that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped prematurely, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`, leading to the error.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` (the `PeriodIndex` instance) is maintained throughout the `_engine` method execution. The weak reference should be utilized correctly when creating the `Period` object. By correctly maintaining the weak reference, we can prevent the premature dropping of the `PeriodIndex` instance, resolving the `NoneType` error.

## Corrected Code
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Pass a weakref of self to _engine_type to avoid reference cycle
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref(), len(self))
```
