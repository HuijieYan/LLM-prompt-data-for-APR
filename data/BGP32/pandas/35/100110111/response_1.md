## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using weak reference to avoid reference cycle in its internal logic. The error message suggests that an attribute `view` is being called on a `NoneType` object, indicating that the weak reference might be causing the issue by not properly holding the reference to the `self` object.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` aims to check whether the level values of the PeriodIndex are monotonic. Due to the bug in the `_engine` function, when accessing `idx2.levels` attributes, it leads to the `NoneType` object error, preventing the test assertion from passing.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs due to the weak reference assignment `period = weakref.ref(self)` not correctly holding a reference to the `self` PeriodIndex, resulting in the `_engine_type` function eventually being called with a `None` object instead of the PeriodIndex.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference actually retains the reference to the `PeriodIndex`. This can be achieved by obtaining the actual object reference from the weak reference before passing it to the `_engine_type` function.

## Corrected Function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this corrected version, the weak reference assignment is removed, and the actual reference to `self` is passed to `_engine_type` for further processing. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
