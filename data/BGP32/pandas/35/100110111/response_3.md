### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine(self)` uses `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type` method.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `PeriodIndex` and retrieves the level values from it to check if they are monotonically increasing.
3. The error message indicates that the AttributeError `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` occurs because the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is getting dropped prematurely, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None`.
4. To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until `_engine_type` processes it.
5. The corrected version should handle the weak reference properly to avoid premature deletion.

### Correction:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, create a weak reference to self and store it in a variable
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine
```

By storing the weak reference in a separate variable `period`, we ensure that the weak reference is maintained until the `_engine_type` method is called, thus preventing the premature deletion of the `PeriodIndex` instance.

This correction should resolve the AttributeError issue and align with the expected input/output values, satisfying the GitHub issue as well.
