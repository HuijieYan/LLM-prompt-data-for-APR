The bug in the `_engine` function seems to be related to the creation of the `period` weak reference object. The weak reference `period` is not properly assigned to the `self` object before being passed to `_engine_type`.

The cause of the bug can be inferred from the error message which states that `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`. This implies that the `self._engine_type` value is `None` at some point, leading to the error when trying to access the `'view'` attribute.

To fix this bug, we need to properly create the weak reference object by assigning it to the `self` object. Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Properly assign the weakref to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
    return engine
```

By assigning the weak reference object `period` to `self` using `(...)`, we ensure that the weak reference refers to the `self` object correctly before passing it to `_engine_type`.

This correction should address the issue and allow the function to work as expected in the failing test case.
