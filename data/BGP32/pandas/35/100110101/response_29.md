### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is utilizing `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference of the `self` object.
2. It then attempts to call `_engine_type` with this weak reference as the first argument and the length of `self` as the second argument.
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is trying to check if all the levels of the `idx2` MultiIndex are monotonic.
4. The error occurs during this check, specifically when accessing the `is_monotonic_increasing` attribute of the IndexEngine, leading to the AttributeError due to a 'NoneType' object not having the 'view' attribute.
5. The expected input values for the buggy function involve a `PeriodArray` for `self._values` and a `PeriodIndex` for `self` while maintaining the correct types.

### Bug Cause
The bug is likely related to how the `weakref.ref(self)` is utilized within the `_engine` function. When the weak reference object is created, it might not be correctly resolving back to the original object when referenced later, leading to a 'NoneType' object error.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the weak reference object `period` created is properly resolved back to the original object `self` when used. We can achieve this by making necessary changes to how the weak reference is handled within the function.

### The Corrected Version of the `_engine` Function
```python
# Assuming `self._engine_type` requires a strong reference and not a weak reference

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By directly passing `self` instead of a weak reference to `_engine_type`, we provide a strong reference to the original object, resolving the issue that led to the 'NoneType' error. This corrected version should satisfy the expected input/output values as specified in the test case.
