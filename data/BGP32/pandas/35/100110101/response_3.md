### Analysis
1. The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is unnecessary in this context.
2. The error message `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` indicates that the `_engine` function is returning `None` instead of an object with a `view` attribute.
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is checking for monotonically increasing values in the levels of `idx2`, which relies on the correct behavior of the `_engine` function.
4. The bug is likely caused by the `_engine_type` not returning the expected object with a `view` attribute.

### Strategy for the Fix
1. Remove the unnecessary `weakref.ref(self)` usage from the `_engine` function.
2. Ensure that `_engine_type` returns an object that has a `view` attribute.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self._values, len(self))
``` 

By simplifying the `_engine` function and passing `self._values` directly to `_engine_type`, the corrected version of the function should no longer return `None`, and the failing test should pass.
