The bug in the `_engine` function is likely due to the weak reference `period` not being properly used when creating the engine. As a result, the return value from `_engine_type` does not behave as expected, leading to the AttributeError during the failing test execution.

To fix this bug, we need to make sure that the weak reference is properly dereferenced when passed to `_engine_type`. We can achieve this by using `period()` instead of `period` directly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By calling `weakref.ref(self)()`, we are dereferencing the weak reference and using the actual `self` object when creating the engine, ensuring proper behavior.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test and provide the expected output values.
