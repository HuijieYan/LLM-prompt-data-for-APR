### Explanation
The bug in the `_engine` function is related to the creation of a weak reference to `self` using `weakref.ref(self)`. The issue arises because `weakref.ref()` returns a weak reference object, not the original object itself. This causes a problem when trying to use this weak reference object to create an instance of `_engine_type`.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` triggers the bug because it indirectly calls the `_engine` function, which in turn uses the weak reference incorrectly, leading to an `AttributeError`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify how we handle the weak reference to `self`. Instead of just passing the weak reference object to `_engine_type`, we need to retrieve the original object from the weak reference object before passing it. This can be done using the `.target` attribute of the weak reference object.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By using `period()` instead of `period`, we are accessing the original object from the weak reference. This corrected version should resolve the issue encountered in the failing test and provide the expected behavior.
