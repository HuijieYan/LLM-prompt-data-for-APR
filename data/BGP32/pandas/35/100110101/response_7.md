### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self), self._offsets)
```

In the corrected version, we added `self._offsets` as an additional parameter when calling `self._engine_type()`. This correction ensures that all necessary information is passed to the `_engine_type` constructor, preventing the `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error message.

By including `self._offsets`, we provide the required attribute for the internal calculation in `self._engine_type` to produce the correct output without any AttributeError.
