The bug in the `_engine` function is causing an AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute of a `NoneType` object. This is likely due to the `_engine_type` function not returning a valid object.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `_engine_type` function returns a valid object that has the `view` attribute. One way to do this is by checking if the returned object is not None before accessing its attributes.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    if engine is not None:
        return engine
    else:
        raise ValueError("Engine object is None.")
```

This modification ensures that if the `_engine_type` function returns None, a ValueError will be raised, preventing the AttributeError seen in the error message. This corrected version should now pass the failing test case by handling the possibility of the `_engine_type` function returning None.
