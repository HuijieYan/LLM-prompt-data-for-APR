### Analysis:
1. The `_engine` function is using a `weakref` to create a weak reference to `self`, but it is not being used correctly in `self._engine_type`.
2. The error message indicates that `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, which suggests that `self._engine_type` is returning `None` instead of the expected object.
3. The failing test is checking if the levels of `idx2` are monotonic, but the issue arises from the incorrect behavior of the `_engine` function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct object is returned by `_engine`. We can modify the function to create a weak reference and then access the object it refers to correctly.

### Bug Fix:
```python
from pandas._libs.index import IndexEngine, PeriodEngine
from pandas import MultiIndex
from pandas import weakref

# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        engine = PeriodEngine(period)
    return engine
```

By correctly utilizing the weak reference object and handling the case where `self._engine_type` returns `None`, we can ensure that a valid `engine` object is returned by the `_engine` function. This fix should address the issue and allow the failing test to pass.
