## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine(self)` uses `weakref.ref(self)` to pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`, but the issue lies in the usage of this weak reference. The error message indicates that `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, which suggests that the weak reference `period` is not functioning correctly. This is likely causing the `_engine_type` to receive `None` instead of a valid reference to `self`.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` does not correctly capture `self`, leading to `self` being treated as `None` when accessing attributes or methods through the weak reference. This results in the error message seen in the failing test.

## Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we should ensure that the weak reference is correctly capturing `self` when passing it to `_engine_type`. One way to do this is by modifying the `_engine` function to use `period()` instead of `period` to retrieve the original reference.

## Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

After making this change, the corrected function should pass the failing test case and successfully provide the expected output values.
