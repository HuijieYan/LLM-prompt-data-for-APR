### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a cached readonly function that creates a weak reference to `self` (a `PeriodIndex` object) and passes it along with the length of `self` to `_engine_type` to create an engine object.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` tries to create a new `MultiIndex` object using the `PeriodIndex` object, and then checks if the levels of the new `MultiIndex` object are monotonic.
3. The error occurs when trying to access `view("i8")` in the `_do_monotonic_check` method. This issue potentially originates from the weak reference approach used in `_engine` function causing a `NoneType` object error.

### Bug Cause
The weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` assigns a weak reference to `self`, which can lead to issues when trying to access attributes or methods of `self` subsequently. This results in `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` potentially returning `None`, causing issues during the execution of the failing test.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the weak reference creation should be avoided, and a strong reference should be used instead to ensure that the actual `self` object is maintained throughout the `_engine_type` call to prevent `NoneType` errors.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
``` 

By directly passing `self` as a strong reference to the `_engine` method, the bug in the weak reference implementation is resolved. This correction guarantees the actual `self` object is provided to `_engine_type` method without any potential issues related to weak referencing.
