The buggy function `_engine` is attempting to create a weak reference to `self` by using `weakref.ref(self)` and then passing this weak reference to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`.

### Potential error locations:
1. The weak reference creation `period = weakref.ref(self)` might not be successfully returning the `WeakMethod` object.
2. The use of `period` as an argument to `_engine_type` might be causing the issue due to incorrect handling of the weak reference.

### Bug Explanation:
The error message indicates an `AttributeError` with the message `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`. This suggests that the weak reference creation or the subsequent use of it in `_engine_type` is resulting in a `NoneType` object being passed where an object with the attribute `view` is expected. This leads to failure in accessing the attribute `view`, causing the test to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference created is correctly used in `_engine_type` to avoid returning a `NoneType` object, and ensure that the required attributes (such as `view`) are accessible from the reference object.
One possible solution could involve modifying how the weak reference is created and utilized within the `_engine` function.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The corrected function for _engine
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By directly passing `self` to `_engine_type`, we avoid the potential issues related to weak reference creation. This modification ensures that the correct object is passed to `_engine_type`, resolving the `AttributeError` and allowing the function to work as expected in the test scenario provided.
