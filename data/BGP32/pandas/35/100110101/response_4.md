The bug in the `_engine` function is that it is returning `None` when trying to access a method or attribute of the `_engine_type`. This results in a `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error when trying to access `view("i8")`.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `_engine_type` is correctly initialized and assigned to `self._engine_type` before accessing it in the `_engine` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    self._engine_type = get_engine_type() # Initialize _engine_type properly
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By initializing `_engine_type` properly before using it, we ensure that the function returns the expected values and types for the given inputs in the failing test case. This correction should address the `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error.
