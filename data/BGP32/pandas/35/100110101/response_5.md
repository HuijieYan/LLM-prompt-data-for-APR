### Analysis
The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `PeriodEngine` class, specifically with the `vgetter` attribute being `NoneType`. This leads to an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute. The buggy function `_engine` is creating a weak reference to `self`, which might be causing the problem when creating the engine type later on.

### Bug Explanation
The bug stems from the way the weak reference to `self` is being used. Weak references are typically used to prevent circular references that could cause memory leaks. In this case, creating a weak reference to `self` in the `_engine` function may not be behaving as expected when creating the engine type later in the code. This results in the `vgetter` attribute being `None` instead of the expected engine type.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to explicitly create a strong reference to `self` when passing it to the engine type constructor. This should ensure that the engine type has a valid reference to `self`.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# Updated version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
``` 

By passing a strong reference to `self`, the corrected version of the `_engine` function should resolve the issue and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
