The bug in the `_engine` function lies in the use of `weakref.ref(self)` instead of `weakref.proxy(self)` to avoid a reference cycle. This results in `weakref.ref(self)` returning a weak reference object, leading to the AttributeError when trying to access attributes of the object.

To fix this bug, we need to replace `weakref.ref(self)` with `weakref.proxy(self)` in the `_engine` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By making this change, the `_engine` function will now correctly create a weak reference proxy object to `self`, preventing the reference cycle issue.

With this correction, the failing test case `test_get_level_values_when_periods` should pass successfully.
