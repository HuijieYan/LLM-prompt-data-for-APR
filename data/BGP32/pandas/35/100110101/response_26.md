### Explanation
The error message is indicating that the `_engine` attribute of the `PeriodIndex` class is returning a `NoneType` object, causing an `AttributeError` when the `view("i8")` method is called on it. This results in the test failing as it expects certain attributes and behaviors from the returned engine.

### Bug Fix Strategy
The `_engine` method should be modified to correctly instantiate the engine type with the weak reference passed, ensuring that the engine object is properly created and returned.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `period` is called to obtain the actual `self` object before passing it to the `_engine_type` constructor. This ensures that the engine object created is valid and retains its attributes to pass the test successfully.
