The bug in the `_engine` function arises from the way the weak reference is used. The `weakref.ref(self)` call creates a weak reference to the `self` object, but it needs to be accessed properly to retrieve the original object. In this case, the weak reference `period` is not being dereferenced correctly before being passed to `_engine_type`.

To fix this bug, we need to dereference the weak reference `period` before passing it to `_engine_type`. We can achieve this by calling `period()` to retrieve the original `self` object. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` instead of `period`, we properly dereference the weak reference and pass the original `self` object to `_engine_type`. This correction should resolve the `AttributeError` issue reported in the failing test and ensure that the expected input/output values are met.
