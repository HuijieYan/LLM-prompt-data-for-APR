### Analysis and Explanation
- The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` object, but it is not being used correctly.
- The error message indicates an AttributeError `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, which suggests that the weak reference is not being properly resolved.
- The expected input values are a `PeriodIndex` object and its values as a `PeriodArray`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug:
1. Use the weak reference properly to avoid reference cycles.
2. Check the resolution of the weak reference to ensure it is not `None`.

### The Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    resolved_period = period()
    if resolved_period is not None:
        return self._engine_type(resolved_period, len(self))
    else:
        raise ValueError("Weak reference resolved to None")
```
