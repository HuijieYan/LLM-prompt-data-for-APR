## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` decorator function that returns an instance of `self._engine_type` by passing two arguments: a weak reference to `self` and the length of `self`.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` tries to create a `MultiIndex` from `Period` objects and then checks if each level of the resulting `MultiIndex` is monotonic.
3. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` related to `view` on a `NoneType` object. This implies that a method is being called on a `None` object, likely due to a missing or incorrect return value in the `_engine` function.

## Bug
The bug in the `_engine` function is that it creates a weak reference `period` to `self` but does not correctly use it to create an instance of `self._engine_type`.

## Fix
To fix the bug, the weak reference `period` should be dereferenced before passing it to `self._engine_type`. Also, a check should be added to ensure that the dereferenced `period` is not `None`.

## Corrected Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    if period is not None:
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By dereferencing `period` using `()` and adding a check to handle the `None` case, the corrected function should now return the expected value without causing the `AttributeError`.
