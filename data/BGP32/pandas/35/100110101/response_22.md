The buggy function `_engine` is attempting to create a weak reference to `self` and then pass it to `_engine_type`. However, the current implementation is causing an issue where `self` is not correctly referenced, leading to the error message `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly handled and passed to `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In this corrected version, `period()` is called to get the actual object reference from the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`.

This modification should address the issue and ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly handled during the function execution.
