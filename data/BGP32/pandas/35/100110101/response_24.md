## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` which is a `PeriodIndex` object. The issue arises because the `period` variable is being passed to `self._engine_type` as a weak reference instead of the actual object, causing attribute errors.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` attempts to check if the period index levels are monotonic using `x.is_monotonic`. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` where a 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view', suggesting that the weak reference handling in `_engine` is causing the issue.

## Fix
To fix this issue, we need to remove the weak reference handling in the `_engine` function and directly pass `self` to `self._engine_type`.

### Corrected Function
```python
# The relative path of the correct file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By passing `self` directly instead of a weak reference, the corrected function should resolve the attribute errors encountered during the failing test.
