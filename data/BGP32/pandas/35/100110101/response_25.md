### Analysis
1. The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`.
2. The bug arises when trying to access `self._engine_type` with `period` as a weak reference, leading to the error message `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.
3. The expected input values are a `self._values` as a `PeriodArray` and `self` as a `PeriodIndex`, leading to the creation of a `PeriodEngine` instance.

### Bug Fix Strategy
The bug can be fixed by directly passing the `self` reference to the `_engine_type` function instead of using `weakref.ref(self)`.

### Corrected Function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
