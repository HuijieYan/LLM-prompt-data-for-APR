## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`, but it is not being used correctly in the subsequent line.
2. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` because the returned value of `_engine_type(period, len(self))` is not behaving as expected.
3. The expected input values include a `PeriodArray` and a `PeriodIndex`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure the correct handling of the weak reference in `_engine`.

## Bug Fix
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

By calling `period()` to dereference the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the correct reference is used. This should fix the `AttributeError` related to the incorrect weak reference usage.
