### Analyze the buggy function and failing test

1. The buggy function `_engine(self)` is a cache_readonly function that returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods()` creates a PeriodIndex `idx` from Periods '2019Q1' and '2019Q2' and then tries to check if the level values are monotonic by accessing `idx2.levels`.
3. The error occurs when trying to check `x.is_monotonic` in the failing test, leading to an AttributeError because the `_engine` method may be returning None instead of the expected engine.
4. The correct behavior should involve `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` returning the appropriate engine for the PeriodIndex.

### Bug Fix Strategy

1. Ensure that the `_engine` method returns a valid engine when called.
2. Check if the weakref reference (`period = weakref.ref(self)`) might be causing any issues in retaining the reference to `self`.
3. Verify that the `self._engine_type` method is correctly instantiated and returning the expected engine.

### The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("Engine returned None value")
    return engine
```

By checking if the `_engine_type` method returns None and raising an error if it does, we ensure that a valid engine is returned, fixing the bug.
