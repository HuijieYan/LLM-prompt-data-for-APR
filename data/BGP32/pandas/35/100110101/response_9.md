### Analysis
1. The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref` incorrectly by assigning `weakref.ref(self)` to `period` without calling it as a function.
2. This leads to the incorrect creation of `period`, causing the subsequent error when trying to use it in `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.
3. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the attribute `view` on a `NoneType` object, which points to the incorrect creation of `period`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correctly create the weak reference using `weakref.ref(self)()` instead of just `weakref.ref(self)`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Correctly create the weak reference object by calling `weakref.ref(self)()`.
2. This will ensure that a proper weak reference object to self is passed to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Code
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
