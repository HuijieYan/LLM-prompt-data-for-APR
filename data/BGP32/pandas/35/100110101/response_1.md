### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `@cache_readonly` function that returns an instance of `_engine_type` with weakref of `self` passed as a parameter.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` with `PeriodIndex` values and performs assertions on `is_monotonic` property.
3. The error occurs at the assertion step when checking `is_monotonic` property within `idx2.levels`.
4. The error message indicates an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, suggesting that the engine or its return value is `None`.

### Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by the return value of `_engine` being `None` instead of a valid engine instance. This leads to the engine being `NoneType`, resulting in the attribute error during the assertion.

### Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that the `_engine` function returns a valid engine instance instead of `None`.
2. Check the `_engine_type` implementation to make sure it returns the appropriate engine object.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    if engine is None:
        # Handle the case where _engine_type returns None
        engine = self.default_engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    return engine
```
