The bug in the `_engine` function is that it uses `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` but doesn't properly handle it when passing it to `self._engine_type`. This leads to an `AttributeError` because the weak reference is not being properly resolved.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is correctly resolved before passing it to `self._engine_type`. We can achieve this by calling the weak reference object `period` to retrieve the original `self` object using `period()`, which will return a strong reference to `self`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By using `period()` to retrieve the original reference object, we resolve the weak reference properly, and the `AttributeError` should be eliminated.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
