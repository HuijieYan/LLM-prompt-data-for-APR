### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This may be causing issues in retaining the reference to `self`.
2. The error message indicates an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, which suggests that `_engine` is returning `None` instead of the expected object or instance.

### Bug Cause
The bug appears to be caused due to the weak reference not properly maintaining the reference to `self`, resulting in None being returned, leading to the AttributeError.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is handled correctly, maintaining the reference until it is no longer needed.

### Corrected Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine if engine is not None else self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By checking if the `engine` is `None` after calling `_engine_type`, we ensure that a proper instance is returned, even if the weak reference does not maintain the reference correctly.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
