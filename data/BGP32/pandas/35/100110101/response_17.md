### Analysis
The function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` which creates a weak reference to `self`. The issue arises when trying to use this weak reference to create an instance of `self._engine_type`, resulting in an `AttributeError` due to a `NoneType` object not having the `view` attribute.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the weak reference to `self` not correctly preserving the reference to the actual `self` object, leading to `self` being `None` when trying to access attributes like `view`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly handled to maintain the reference during the execution of `_engine`. One way to address this is by using a strong reference to `self` within the function to retain its object properties.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use a strong reference to self to maintain the object
    period = self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
