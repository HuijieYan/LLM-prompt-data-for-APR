### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is trying to create an engine type using a weak reference to the PeriodIndex object. The bug seems to be related to the way the weak reference is being created. This is leading to an AttributeError when trying to access a view attribute on a NoneType object.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the weak reference `period` is not being properly handled when used to create the engine type. This results in a NoneType object being accessed instead of the expected engine type, leading to the AttributeError.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we should modify how the weak reference is created and utilized. We should ensure that the weak reference is correctly dereferenced to obtain the actual object when creating the engine type.

### Corrected Function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, we can maintain a proxy reference to the `self` object, which will allow for proper dereferencing and prevent the AttributeError from occurring.
