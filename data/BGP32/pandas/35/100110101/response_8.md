The bug in the `_engine` function is related to the weak reference creation using `weakref.ref(self)`. It seems that the `_engine_type` function is not handling the weak reference properly, leading to an `AttributeError` when trying to access an attribute on a `NoneType` object.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `_engine_type` correctly handles the weak reference to avoid the `NoneType` error.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we create a proxy object that behaves like the original object but prevents a reference cycle and avoids the `AttributeError` when accessing attributes.

This correction should address the issue and allow the failing test to pass with the provided expected values and types.
