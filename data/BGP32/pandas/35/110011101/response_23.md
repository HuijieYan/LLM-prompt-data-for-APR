## Bug Explanation
The bug is occurring in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The error message indicates that the `NoneType` object does not have the attribute `view`, suggesting that `_engine_type` is returning `None`. This leads to an `AttributeError` when trying to access `view("i8")`.

The cause of the bug lies in the implementation of the `_engine` function. The function is attempting to create a weak reference to `self` using `weakref.ref(self)` but is not correctly passing this weak reference to the `_engine_type` constructor. Due to this incorrect handling of the weak reference, `_engine_type` is likely failing to create the engine object and returning `None` instead.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly passed to the `_engine_type` constructor in the `_engine` function.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if self._engine_type is not None else None
``` 

This corrected version checks if `_engine_type` is `None` before attempting to create the engine object. If `_engine_type` is `None`, the function returns `None` as well, avoiding the `AttributeError` that was occurring.
