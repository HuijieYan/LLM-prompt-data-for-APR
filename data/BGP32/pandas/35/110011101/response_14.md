### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs due to the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class returning `None` instead of the expected engine type (`PeriodEngine`). This leads to an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute on the engine.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine` function returns an instance of the `PeriodEngine` class rather than `None`.

### Corrected Code
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if self._engine_type else None
``` 

This code snippet includes a check to verify that `_engine_type` is not `None` before returning the engine. This should prevent the `AttributeError` when accessing the `view` attribute.
