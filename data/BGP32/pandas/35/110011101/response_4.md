The bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class seems to be related to how the `PeriodEngine` class is constructed. 

The error message indicates that an `AttributeError` is raised when trying to access the `view` attribute of a `NoneType` object. This suggests that the `_engine_type` method is not returning a valid `PeriodEngine` object.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine_type` method returns a proper `PeriodEngine` object.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    if engine is not None and isinstance(engine, PeriodEngine):
        return engine
    else:
        raise ValueError("Failed to initialize the PeriodEngine.")
```

This fix ensures that the `_engine` function checks if the returned engine is a valid `PeriodEngine` object before returning it. If the engine is either `None` or not an instance of `PeriodEngine`, it raises a `ValueError`.

By making this adjustment, the bug should be fixed, and the failing tests should be resolved.
