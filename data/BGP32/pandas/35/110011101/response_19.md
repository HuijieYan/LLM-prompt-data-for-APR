### Analysis
The error message indicates an issue with an attribute `view` on a `NoneType` object, suggesting that the `_engine` attribute is not being correctly initialized in the `PeriodEngine` class. The `self._do_monotonic_check()` method is trying to access this attribute, leading to the error.

Looking at the buggy function `_engine`, it is creating a weak reference to the `self` object and then calling `_engine_type` with this weak reference and the length of `self` as arguments. However, weak references are not guaranteed to keep the object alive, which might be the reason why `self` becomes `None` in the subsequent class.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the reference to `self` is maintained properly. One way to achieve this is by storing a strong reference to `self` while creating the weak reference, so that `self` remains alive during the lifetime of the weak reference.

### The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a strong reference to self before creating the weak reference
    strong_self = self
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of strong_self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(strong_self)
    return strong_self._engine_type(period, len(strong_self))
```
