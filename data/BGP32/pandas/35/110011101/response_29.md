The bug occurs within the `_engine` function where `weakref.ref(self)` is causing the issue. The problem arises because `_engine_type` cannot deal with the weak reference object correctly, leading to the AttributeError when trying to access an attribute on a NoneType object.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to pass the actual object reference instead of a weak reference.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By passing `self` directly instead of using a weak reference object, we ensure that the `_engine` function has a valid reference to the PeriodIndex object.

This correction should resolve the AttributeError issue and make the failing test pass successfully.
