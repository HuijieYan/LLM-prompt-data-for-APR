The bug in the `_engine` function stems from a potential issue with the instantiation of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. The error message indicates an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, suggesting that the `_engine_type` might not be properly initialized.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine_type` is correctly instantiated and returned within the `_engine` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if self._engine_type else None
```

By adding a check to ensure that `self._engine_type` is not `None`, we can prevent the `AttributeError` from occurring. This change ensures that the `_engine_type` is properly initialized before being returned by the function.
