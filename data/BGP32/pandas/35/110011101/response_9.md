## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance. It then tries to call `self._engine_type()` with the weak reference and the length of the index to return an engine object.
2. The error occurs when attempting to access the engine object with `self._engine.is_monotonic_increasing`. The error message indicates that there is an issue with `self._engine` being a `NoneType`.
   
## Bug Explanation
The bug arises because the weak reference created with `weakref.ref(self)` is not holding a strong reference to the original object, leading to the `_engine` attribute being `None`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference created by `weakref.ref(self)` is not garbage collected before accessing the `_engine` attribute. One way to achieve this is by storing the weak reference in a separate attribute of the class.

## Updated Buggy Function
```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self to prevent garbage collection
    if not hasattr(self, '_period_ref'):
        self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    period = self._period_ref
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
