The issue seems to be related to the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class. The error message indicates that there is an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` when trying to access the `view` attribute on a `NoneType` object.

The problem is likely with the `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` call within the `_engine` function. It seems that `self._engine_type` might be returning `None` instead of the expected engine object, leading to the `AttributeError`.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` returns a valid engine object instead of `None`.

Here is a corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type should not return None")
    
    return engine
```

This corrected version explicitly checks if the `engine` object returned from `_engine_type` is `None`. If it is `None`, it raises a `ValueError` indicating that `_engine_type` should not return `None`. This change ensures that the `_engine` function returns a valid engine object as expected.
