The bug in the `_engine` function is likely related to the `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` call. The error message indicates an issue with `vgetter()` attribute returning a `NoneType` object which does not have the `view` attribute.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine_type` function returns a valid object without returning `None`.

Here is a corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
        
        if engine is None:
            raise ValueError("_engine_type returned None, must return a valid engine object")
            
        return engine
```

In this corrected version, we explicitly handle the case where `_engine_type` returns `None` and raise a `ValueError` in such situations to indicate that a valid engine object must be returned.

This fix ensures that we avoid the AttributeError related to `NoneType` objects and guarantees that a valid engine is returned.
