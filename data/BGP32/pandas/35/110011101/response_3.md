The bug in the `_engine` function is causing an `AttributeError` due to a `NoneType` object not having the `view` attribute. This indicates that a variable that should contain a valid value is actually `None` at some point during the execution.

The bug is likely caused by the weak reference usage in the `_engine` function. The weak reference `period` is created with `weakref.ref(self)`, but it seems that it is not properly dereferenced to get the actual object it is referring to. This results in an issue when trying to access attributes or methods of the underlying object.

To fix this bug, we should properly dereference the weak reference `period` before using it to instantiate the `self._engine_type`. This can be done using the `period` object like `period()` to get the actual object.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

This correction ensures that the weak reference `period` is accessed and converted to the actual object it references before being used in the `_engine_type` instantiation.
