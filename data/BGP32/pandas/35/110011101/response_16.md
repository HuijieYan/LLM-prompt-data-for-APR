The bug in the `_engine` function is causing an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute of a `NoneType` object. This error indicates that the `_engine_type` function is returning `None`, resulting in the failure of the subsequent attribute access.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine_type` function returns a valid object instead of `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    result = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if result is None:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type returned None")
    return result
```

By adding a check for `None` and raising an informative `ValueError` in case the result is `None`, we can ensure that the `_engine_type` function always returns a valid object.

This correction should address the `AttributeError` and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
