### Fixing the Bug

The bug in the `_engine` function arises from the fact that the `_engine_type` function is not correctly handling the weak reference to the `self` object, resulting in a `NoneType` error when trying to access attributes on the object.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is appropriately handled in the `_engine_type` function. We can achieve this by modifying the `_engine` function to pass a weak reference to `self` correctly to `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

By correctly passing the weak reference `period_ref` created from `self` to the `_engine_type` function, we ensure that the reference to `self` is maintained without causing a reference cycle and resolving the `NoneType` error.

This fix should address the issue and allow the failing test case to pass successfully.
