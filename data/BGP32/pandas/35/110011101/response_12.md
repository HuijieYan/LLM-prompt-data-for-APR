The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the `_engine_type` not being properly initialized with weak reference to `self._values` (PeriodArray) causing an AttributeError when trying to access its view attribute.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to properly create a weak reference to `self._values` and pass it to `_engine_type`. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self._values to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self._values)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By making this change, we ensure that the weak reference is correctly set up with `self._values`, resolving the AttributeError that was previously occurring.

This fix should address the issue and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
