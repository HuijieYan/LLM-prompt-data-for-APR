### Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class. The `_engine` method tries to create an instance of the `_engine_type` class with a weak reference to the `self` object (which is the `PeriodIndex` instance). However, the bug causes an `AttributeError` because the `_engine_type` initialization does not handle weak references correctly, resulting in a `NoneType` object being accessed.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `_engine_type` initialization does not correctly handle the weak reference to `self`. When the `PeriodEngine` class attempts to access the weak reference, it results in a `NoneType` object since the weak reference is not dereferenced properly. This leads to an `AttributeError` when trying to access the attribute `view` on a `NoneType` object.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_engine` method to correctly handle the weak reference to `self`. We should dereference the weak reference before passing it to the `_engine_type` initialization.

### Corrected Code
```python
# this is the corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
