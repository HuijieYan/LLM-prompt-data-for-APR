Based on the provided buggy function and error message, the issue seems to be related to the `_engine` function returning a `NoneType` object which causes an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the implementation of the `_engine` function not correctly initializing and returning the `_engine_type` object. This results in the `_engine` function returning `None`, hence the `NoneType` object error.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine` function initializes and returns the `_engine_type` object correctly without returning `None`.

Here is a corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine_type
```

By ensuring that the `_engine` function returns the `engine_type` object instead of `None`, we should be able to fix the bug and pass the failing test.
