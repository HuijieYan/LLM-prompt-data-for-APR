### Analysis
The error message indicates an AttributeError on a `NoneType` object. This suggests that the `_engine` attribute of the `PeriodIndex` class is not being set correctly, resulting in it being `None` when later accessed. This inconsistency likely leads to the subsequent error when trying to access attributes of the engine.

In the provided buggy function, the `_engine` method is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is then passed to `_engine_type` to create the engine. However, it seems that the weak reference is not being properly resolved or stored in the `_engine` attribute, leading to it being `None`.

### Bug Cause
The bug seems to be caused by not properly handling the weak reference object when creating the `_engine`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is properly resolved and stored in the `_engine` attribute. We might need to adjust the way weak references are handled to make sure the engine object is correctly created.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    if not hasattr(self, '_engine_instance'):
        weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
        self._engine_instance = self._engine_type(weak_period, len(self))
    return self._engine_instance
```

By storing the `_engine_instance` as an attribute of the class instance, we ensure that the engine object created from the weak reference is retained and accessible in subsequent calls to `_engine`. This should resolve the issue with the weak reference and prevent the `NoneType` error.
