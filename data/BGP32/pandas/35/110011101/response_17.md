The bug in the provided function `_engine` is likely due to an issue with initializing the `_engine_type` with the weakref of `self` as intended. The error message indicates that an `AttributeError` is raised because a `NoneType` object is trying to access the `view` attribute.

To fix this bug, we need to properly pass the weak reference of `self` to the `_engine_type` constructor. We can achieve this by dereferencing the weak reference when creating the `_engine_type` instance.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By invoking `weakref.ref(self)()`, the weak reference is immediately dereferenced, providing the original `self` instance to the `_engine_type` constructor.

This fix should resolve the `AttributeError` issue seen in the failing test. After applying this correction, the function should correctly initialize the `_engine_type` instance with the `PeriodIndex` instance.
