The bug in the `_engine` function is causing an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` when trying to access the `view` attribute of a `NoneType` object. This bug seems to occur due to a reference cycle issue where the `weakref.ref(self)` is not properly referencing the `self` object.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `_engine` function to resolve the weak reference properly. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of calling the self object to _engine_type
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` instead of just `period`, we create a strong reference to the `self` object and avoid the reference cycle issue.

This corrected version should resolve the `AttributeError` issue and pass the failing test case.
