### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `_engine` function is trying to create a new instance of the `engine_type` class, passing a `weakref` of `self` and the length of the `PeriodIndex`, but the `self._engine_type` is not properly initialized, resulting in a `NoneType` object that does not have the `view` attribute. This leads to the `AttributeError` during the test execution.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine_type` attribute is properly initialized and that it correctly creates a new instance of the engine type using the provided values.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# Corrected _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type or self._default_engine_type
    return engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected code, we check if `_engine_type` is not `None`. If it is `None`, we fall back to using `_default_engine_type` as a backup plan. This ensures that an appropriate engine type is used to avoid the `AttributeError`.
