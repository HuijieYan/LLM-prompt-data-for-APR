The bug in the `_engine` function is causing an `AttributeError` because the `_engine_type` method is not returning a valid object. This is likely due to a reference cycle issue with the weak reference `period`. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is accessed correctly within the `_engine` function. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we assign the weak reference to a variable `period_ref` before passing it to the `_engine_type` method. This should resolve the reference cycle issue and prevent the `AttributeError` from occurring.
