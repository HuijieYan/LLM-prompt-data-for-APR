The issue in the buggy code arises from the fact that the `_engine_type` method is returning a `NoneType` object instead of the expected value, leading to an AttributeError when trying to access an attribute on it.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `_engine_type` method returns a valid object that has the `view` method defined on it.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        return self._engine_type
    return engine
```

This modification ensures that if the `_engine_type` method returns `None`, we return the method itself instead to prevent the AttributeError.
