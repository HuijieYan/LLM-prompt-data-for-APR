The bug in the `_engine` function is likely caused by a reference cycle within the weak reference usage. The weak reference to `self` is not being handled correctly, leading to a `NoneType` error when trying to access the view of the index values.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the weak reference usage in the `_engine` function to ensure that the reference to `self` is maintained during the function execution.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    self._check_hashtable_period()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In this corrected version, we added a call to `_check_hashtable_period` which helps maintain the reference to `self` and avoids the `NoneType` error that was occurring previously. This change should resolve the issue and ensure the function works correctly without causing any errors.
