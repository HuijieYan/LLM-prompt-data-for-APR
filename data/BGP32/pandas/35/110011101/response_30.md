The issue in the buggy function is related to the `_engine` method trying to create an instance of `PeriodEngine` with weak references, but a NoneType error occurs in the `_do_monotonic_check` function. This error arises because the `self._get_index_values()` function is returning None due to weak references not being accessed correctly.

To fix this bug, we need to modify how the weak reference is being utilized in the `_engine` method. Instead of directly creating a weak reference to `self`, we should access the weak reference object and then retrieve the strong reference when required.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` method:

```python
# Corrected version of the _engine method
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    period_index = period()
    if period_index is None:
        return None

    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By checking if the weak reference `period()` is not None before usage, we ensure that the weak reference is accessed properly, fixing the AttributeError that was occurring. This correction should enable the failing test case to pass successfully.
