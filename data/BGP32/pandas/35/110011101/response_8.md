Based on the error message and the provided information, the bug seems to be related to the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class. The `_engine` function is returning a value that leads to an `AttributeError` when accessed later on in the code.

The expected behavior is for the `_engine` function to return an instance of `PeriodEngine`. However, the buggy function is returning the result of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, which is causing the issue.

To fix this bug, we should ensure that the `_engine` function returns an instance of `PeriodEngine`. We can achieve this by creating an instance of `PeriodEngine` correctly and returning it in the `_engine` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return PeriodEngine(period, len(self))
```

With this fix, the `PeriodEngine` instance will be returned correctly, and the `AttributeError` should be resolved when accessing the `_engine` attribute later in the code.
