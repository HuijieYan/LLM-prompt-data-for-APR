The bug in the provided function `_engine` is likely due to `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` returning a `NoneType` object, which is causing issues when trying to access the attribute `view("i8")`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `_engine_type` returns a valid object instead of `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
        if engine is not None:
            return engine
        else:
            raise ValueError("_engine_type returned None")
```

This modification ensures that if `_engine_type` returns `None`, an exception is raised, preventing the subsequent AttributeError during attribute access.
