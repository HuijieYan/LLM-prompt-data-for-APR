### Analysis
The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`, but it is not properly dereferencing it when invoking `_engine_type`. This results in an AttributeError when trying to access an attribute of the weak reference.

### Bug Cause
The `_engine` function returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, passing `period` as a weak reference. When trying to access an attribute on `self._engine`, it fails because it is trying to access an attribute on a weak reference.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to dereference the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`. This can be done by using the `weakref` object directly to get the referenced object.

### Corrected Function
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Dereference the weak reference here before passing it to _engine_type.
        ref_self = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(ref_self(), len(self))
``` 

This corrected version of the function should properly dereference the weak reference before invoking `_engine_type`, addressing the bug and allowing the tests to pass.
