### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is a `PeriodIndex` object.
2. The function is intended to return an object of `_engine_type` using the weak reference created.
3. The issue reported on GitHub suggests that weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` objects are being dropped prematurely, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

### Error Location
The issue seems to be related to how weak references are handled in the `_engine` function, leading to premature dropping of the weak reference.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the premature dropping of the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained until it is no longer needed in the `_engine` function.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Ensure the weak reference is retained by accessing it here
    engine_instance = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine_instance
```

In this corrected version, the weak reference to `self` is retained by accessing it before returning the `_engine_type` instance. This approach ensures that the weak reference is not dropped prematurely.
