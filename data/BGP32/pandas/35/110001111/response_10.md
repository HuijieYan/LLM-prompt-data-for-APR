#### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance and then passing this weak reference to `_engine_type` to avoid a reference cycle.
2. The issue arises when weak references are not properly handled, leading `_engine_type` to receive `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex` instance.
3. The expected behavior is to correctly pass the weak reference to `_engine_type` without losing the reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance.

#### Bug Cause:
The bug causes weak references to be lost when passing them to `_engine_type`, resulting in `_engine_type` receiving `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex` instance.

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance remains valid when passed to `_engine_type`. This can be achieved by modifying how the weak reference is created and used in the `_engine` function.

#### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By modifying the `_engine` function as shown above, the weak reference created with `weakref.ref(self)` will correctly pass the reference to `_engine_type`, resolving the issue with weak references being lost.
