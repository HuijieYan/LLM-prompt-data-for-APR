## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using the `weakref` module to create a weak reference to `self`, which is then passed to `_engine_type` to avoid reference cycles. However, the bug seems to be related to the weak reference, as the `period` variable is not being used correctly. This leads to passing `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by how the weak reference `period` is being created but not used properly in the `_engine` function. This results in `None` being passed to `_engine_type` instead of the `PeriodIndex` object.

## Proposed Fix
To fix the bug, we need to correctly utilize the weak reference created for `self`. We can obtain the weak reference object's actual reference using the `period()` method. Then, we can pass this actual reference to `_engine_type` instead of the weak reference itself.

## Updated Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By invoking `period()` on the weak reference, we retrieve the actual referenced object, which in this case is the `PeriodIndex` instance. This corrected version ensures that the actual `PeriodIndex` object is passed to `_engine_type`, resolving the bug related to weak references.

This fix aligns with the expected input/output values and addresses the GitHub issue related to weak references in `PeriodIndex`.
