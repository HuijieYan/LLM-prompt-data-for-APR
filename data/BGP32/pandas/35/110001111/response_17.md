### Analysis:
1. The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `self` to create a weak reference, but it is not handling the weak reference properly, which leads to losing the reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance when it is copied.
   
2. The issue arises when copying `PeriodIndex` levels in a `MultiIndex`, causing weak references to be lost.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of weak references in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. When a `PeriodIndex` instance is copied, the weak reference to itself is not maintained, leading to a loss of reference and resulting in unexpected behavior when accessing the copied levels.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance is maintained even when it is copied. One way to achieve this is by storing the weak reference to `self` as an attribute of the `PeriodIndex` instance, ensuring that the reference is not lost during copying.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected version of the _engine function in the PeriodIndex class
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    if not hasattr(self, '_weakref'):
        self._weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    
    return self._engine_type(self._weakref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference to `self` as `_weakref` attribute, we ensure that the reference is maintained even when the `PeriodIndex` instance is copied. This corrected version addresses the bug by preserving the weak reference throughout the copying process, resolving the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
