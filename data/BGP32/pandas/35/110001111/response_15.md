## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is a `PeriodIndex` instance.
2. The `__init__` method of the `PeriodIndex` class probably should initialize the `PeriodIndex` object with a list of string representations of periods like '2019Q1', '2019Q2'.
3. The expected values provided for the case indicate that the `self._values` attribute should contain a representation of the periods like ['2019Q1', '2019Q2'].
4. The issue from GitHub highlights the problem where weak references are lost, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving None instead of the PeriodIndex object.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs because when creating a weak reference to `self`, it does not retain the reference to the PeriodIndex object. This results in the PeriodEngine receiving None instead of a valid reference to the PeriodIndex object.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, you need to ensure that the weak reference created with `weakref.ref(self)` properly retains the reference to the `self` object. This can be achieved by changing the way weak references are created in the `_engine` function.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```  

In the corrected version, `weakref.proxy` is used instead of `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`, ensuring that the reference to `self` is maintained for the PeriodEngine to operate correctly.
