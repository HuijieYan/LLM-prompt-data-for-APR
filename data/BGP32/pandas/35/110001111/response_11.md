### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is utilizing a weak reference to `self`, which is causing the issue as weak references can be garbage collected unexpectedly. This results in the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the actual `PeriodIndex`.
2. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the problem of weak references being lost when copying `PeriodIndex` levels within a `MultiIndex`.
3. The expected behavior is for the weak reference to be maintained correctly.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is stable and not unexpectedly garbage collected.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the use of a weak reference to `self` inside the `_engine` function. Weak references can lose their reference unexpectedly, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None`.

### Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug, we will modify the `_engine` function to store a strong reference to `self`, ensuring that the `PeriodIndex` is not garbage collected prematurely.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Modified the _engine function to use a strong reference to self instead of weakref
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
``` 

By using a strong reference to `self`, we prevent the weak reference from being lost prematurely, ensuring that the `PeriodEngine` receives the correct `PeriodIndex` object.
