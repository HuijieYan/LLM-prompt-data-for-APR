### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using a weak reference `weakref.ref(self)` to prevent a reference cycle. However, the issue seems to be related to losing weakrefs when copying `PeriodIndex` levels in a `MultiIndex`, leading to an error due to the `PeriodEngine` receiving None instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

### Error Locations
The error likely occurs in the weak reference handling inside the `_engine` function.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is likely caused by the weak reference not being maintained properly when copying `PeriodIndex` levels in a `MultiIndex`. This results in the `PeriodEngine` receiving None instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`, leading to errors.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly maintained even when `PeriodIndex` levels are copied in a `MultiIndex`.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By maintaining the weak reference properly, the bug should be resolved.
