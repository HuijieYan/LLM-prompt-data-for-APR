## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a cache readonly function that returns an engine type with a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object passed to the `_engine_type` function.
   
2. The issue mentioned on GitHub states that copying `PeriodIndex` levels on a `MultiIndex` results in losing weak references, causing an error.

## Bug Identification
The bug is likely caused by the weak reference `period` not being maintained correctly, resulting in the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped prematurely.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained correctly throughout the `_engine` function's lifecycle.

## Corrected Version
```python
    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To prevent weak reference from being lost prematurely
        self_ref = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(self_ref, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we store the weak reference directly to `self` within the function, ensuring that it remains valid throughout its usage. This change should prevent the premature loss of the weak reference and resolve the issue described on GitHub.
