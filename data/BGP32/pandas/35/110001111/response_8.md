### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class returns an instance of `_engine_type`, passing a weak reference of `self` and the length of `self`. According to the GitHub issue, there is a problem with weak references being dropped before intended, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

### Error Location
The potential error lies in the weak reference assignment `period = weakref.ref(self)`. Weak references can be problematic if not handled correctly, especially when the reference is not maintained properly throughout the function's execution.

### Cause of the Bug
1. The weak reference `period` is created within the `_engine` function.
2. As the weak reference is not stored or maintained throughout the function's execution, it may get dropped prematurely.
3. This premature dropping of the weak reference results in `None` being passed to the `_engine_type` constructor instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained throughout the function's execution. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference within the `PeriodIndex` instance itself.

### Corrected Version
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function in the PeriodIndex class
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):

    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Store the weak reference within the instance to prevent premature dropping
        self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we store the weak reference to `self` in an attribute `_period_ref` within the `PeriodIndex` instance. This ensures that the weak reference is maintained throughout the function's execution, resolving the issue of passing `None` to the `PeriodEngine`.
