### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is creating a weak reference to the `self` object of the `PeriodIndex` class and passing it to `_engine_type` along with the length of the `PeriodIndex`.
2. The issue seems to be related to weak referencing of the `PeriodIndex` object, leading to the engine receiving `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.
3. The `PeriodIndex` class is expected to maintain weak references properly for correct functionality.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `_engine` function not correctly handling the weak reference to the `self` object of the `PeriodIndex` class, resulting in it being dropped before intended.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `self` object is properly handled throughout the function to avoid it being dropped prematurely.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `period()` is called to get the actual `self` object from the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`. This change ensures that the `self` object is correctly passed to `_engine_type` without being dropped prematurely.

By implementing this fix, the function should now correctly handle weak references to the `PeriodIndex` object and resolve the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
