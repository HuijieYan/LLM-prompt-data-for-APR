#### Analysis:

1. The buggy function `_engine` is supposed to return an instance of `_engine_type` class using a weak reference to the `self` PeriodIndex instance.
   
2. The bug seems to be related to the weak reference setup not correctly being passed to `_engine_type`, resulting in a reference cycle issue.

3. In the failing test case, the `self` PeriodIndex instance is created with values `['2019Q1', '2019Q2']` and certain attributes. The expected values of `self._values` and `self` are provided. The bug is impacting the creation of the `_engine` instance.

4. To fix the bug, ensure that the weak reference is correctly passed to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`.

#### Bug Fix:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
