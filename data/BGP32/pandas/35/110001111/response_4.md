### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is intended to return an engine created with a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object. However, due to the way the weak reference is created and stored, there is a bug causing the reference cycle to not be broken properly, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Bug:
The bug occurs because the `PeriodIndex` object is weakly referenced using `weakref.ref`, but it is done incorrectly. The weak reference should be stored as an attribute of the `PeriodIndex` instance, but currently, it is stored as a local variable `period`. This local variable goes out of scope immediately after the function is executed, breaking the weak reference cycle.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `_engine` function to store the weak reference as an attribute of the `PeriodIndex` instance.
2. Use this stored weak reference to create the engine for the `PeriodIndex`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _engine(self):
    # Store weak reference of self as an attribute
    self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference as an attribute of the `PeriodIndex` instance, the reference cycle will be properly broken when needed, resolving the issue and ensuring correct behavior of the function.
