### Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class
The buggy function `_engine` is a method of the `PeriodIndex` class. It is a cached read-only property that returns an instance of `_engine_type` initialized with a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object. This weak reference is intended to avoid a reference cycle.

### Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The weak reference usage might be incorrect.
2. Initializing `_engine_type` might not handle the weak reference properly.
3. The return value might not be correct due to issues with the weak reference.

### Explanation of the bug
The bug occurs when the weak reference to `self` is not properly maintained, leading to a `None` being passed to the `_engine_type` constructor instead of the `PeriodIndex` object. This results in unexpected behavior when the `_engine` property is accessed later on.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Ensure the weak reference to `self` is correctly maintained throughout.
2. Validate that the `_engine_type` constructor can handle a weak reference properly.
3. Update the return value of the `_engine` property to return a valid `_engine_type` instance.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, the weak reference is correctly accessed by calling `period()` to retrieve the referenced object before passing it to the `_engine_type` constructor. This should ensure that the weak reference behaves as expected and resolves the issue.
