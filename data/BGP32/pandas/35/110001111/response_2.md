## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is creating a weak reference to `self` and passing it to `_engine_type`. The issue reported on GitHub related to this bug indicates that weak references are not maintained properly when copying levels on a `MultiIndex`.

## Error Location
The bug lies in the way the weak reference to `self` is being handled in the `_engine` function.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is causing the weak reference to `self` to be lost when it should be maintained to prevent reference cycles. This causes the `_engine_type` to receive `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly maintained and retrieved when needed in the `_engine` function.

## Solution
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `period()` is called, which returns the original `self` from the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`. This maintains the reference properly and should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
