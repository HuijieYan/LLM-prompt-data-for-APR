### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class returns an instance of `_engine_type` by passing a weak reference of `self` as a parameter. This is intended to avoid reference cycles.
2. The issue seems to arise from the weak reference handling, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.
3. The expected output is that the weak reference to `self` should be maintained properly so that the `PeriodEngine` receives the correct reference to the `PeriodIndex`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference handling is done correctly to prevent the reference from being lost.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Maintain a strong reference to `self` while creating the weak reference to avoid it being garbage collected.
2. Modify the `_engine` function to correctly handle the weak reference and create the `PeriodEngine` instance with the valid reference to `self`.

### Bug Fixed Version:
```python
# Fixed and updated version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a strong reference of self to weakref
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    self._period_ref = period  # Store a strong reference to avoid being garbage collected
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the fixed version, we are holding a strong reference to `self` by assigning it to `self._period_ref` after creating a weak reference. This ensures that the weak reference retains a valid reference to `self`, preventing it from being garbage collected prematurely.
