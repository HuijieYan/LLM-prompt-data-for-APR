**Analysis:**

1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` method of the `PeriodIndex` class. It is intended to return an instance of `_engine_type` by passing a weak reference of `self` as `period`.
   
2. The function creates a weak reference to `self` but does not handle it properly, which causes the weak reference to become None and leads to unexpected behavior.

**Bug Cause:**

The buggy function does not preserve the weak reference properly, causing it to become None before being used to create an instance of `_engine_type`. This results in the `_engine` function encountering a weakly referenced PeriodIndex that has been dropped, leading to unexpected behavior.

**Bug Fix:**

To fix the bug, ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly preserved before being passed to `_engine_type`.

**Corrected Version:**

```python
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By ensuring that the weak reference `period` is maintained throughout the function's usage, the bug can be fixed. This corrected version preserves the weak reference to `self` and passes it to `_engine_type` to avoid encountering None references.
