### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is utilizing `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object of the `PeriodIndex` class. This weak reference is then passed to `_engine_type` to avoid a reference cycle. However, the issue arises when the weak reference is not maintained properly, resulting in a `None` object being passed to `_engine_type` instead of the intended `self` object.

### Error Location:
The issue lies in the way the weak reference to `self` is handled within the `_engine` function.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the weak reference to `self` is not being maintained correctly, leading to the weak reference being dropped before it is intended to be accessed in `_engine_type`. This discrepancy results in a `None` object being passed instead of the `self` object, causing errors in subsequent operations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly managed in a way that it is not prematurely dropped before being used in the intended operation. This can be achieved by carefully handling the weak reference and ensuring its validity at the point of reference in `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if period() is not None else None
```

By checking if the weak reference `period()` is not `None` before passing it to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the intended `self` object is valid and prevent the issue of passing a `None` object. This correction should resolve the problem described in the GitHub issue and maintain the integrity of the weak reference mechanism in the `PeriodIndex` class.
