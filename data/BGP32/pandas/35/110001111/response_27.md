## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is meant to return an instance of `self._engine_type`, passing a weak reference of `self` and the length of `self` as arguments.
2. The bug seems to be related to creating the weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` but not passing it correctly to `_engine_type`.
3. The issue on GitHub indicates that weak references are being lost, leading to unexpected behavior in MultiIndex levels.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correctly pass the weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type` in the `return` statement.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is correctly passed to `_engine_type` in the `return` statement.

## Bug-fixed Version
```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@inherit_names(['strftime', 'to_timestamp', 'asfreq', 'start_time', 'end_time'] + PeriodArray._field_ops, PeriodArray, wrap=True)
@inherit_names(['is_leap_year', 'freq', '_format_native_types'], PeriodArray)
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):

    # Fixed and corrected version of the function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type correctly.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))  # Passing weak reference correctly

```

By updating the `return` statement to `return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))`, we ensure that the weak reference created earlier is correctly passed to `_engine_type`, fixing the bug where weak references are lost.
