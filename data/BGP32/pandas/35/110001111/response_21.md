### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is a `PeriodIndex` object. The `PeriodIndex` class contains metadata and properties related to time periods.
2. The function returns an instance of `_engine_type` class, passing the weak reference `period` and the length of `self` to its constructor.
3. The bug arises from the weak reference `period` possibly being garbage collected before it is intended to be used in `_engine_type`, leading to `None` being passed instead of the expected `PeriodIndex` object.
4. To fix this bug, we should ensure that the weak reference `period` remains accessible throughout the function's execution, preventing premature garbage collection.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Modify the `_engine` function to store the weak reference `period` as an attribute of the `self` object. This ensures that the weak reference remains alive as long as the `self` object exists.
- When creating the `weakref.ref` object for `self`, store it as `self._weak_period` to maintain a reference to the weak reference.
- Update the `_engine_type` call to pass `self._weak_period` instead of creating a new weak reference within the function.

### Corrected Version
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    self._weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._weak_period, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference as an attribute of `self`, we ensure that the reference remains accessible and prevents premature garbage collection. This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug related to weakrefs in MultiIndex levels.
