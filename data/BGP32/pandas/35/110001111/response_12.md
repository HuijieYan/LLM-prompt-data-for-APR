### Analysis

1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` method of the `PeriodIndex` class. It defines a weak reference `period` to the `self` instance of `PeriodIndex` and then calls `_engine_type` passing `period` as an argument.

2. The issue described on GitHub pertains to copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` losing weak references. The problem occurs as the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped prematurely, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the actual `PeriodIndex`.

### Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by the premature dropping of the weak reference `period` before it is used in the `_engine_type` function. This results in `None` being passed instead of the expected `PeriodIndex` instance.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the weak reference `period` needs to be maintained until after its usage in the `_engine_type` function, ensuring that the `PeriodIndex` instance is correctly passed.

### Bug-fixed code
```python
    def _engine(self):
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        engine_result = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
        return engine_result
```
