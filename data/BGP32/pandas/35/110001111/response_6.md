### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is trying to create a weak reference to `self` and pass it to `_engine_type` to avoid a reference cycle. However, due to a potential bug, the weak reference is not being properly stored, resulting in `None` being passed to `_engine_type`. This causes issues when creating `PeriodEngine` objects, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Error location:
The bug is likely in the line `period = weakref.ref(self)`, where the weak reference is assigned to a local variable `period` instead of being stored as an instance attribute.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the weak reference created to `self` is not retained within the `PeriodIndex` instance, leading to premature garbage collection of the weak reference object and passing `None` to `_engine_type` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex` reference.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly stored within the `PeriodIndex` instance, so it is not prematurely garbage collected. This can be achieved by assigning the weak reference to an instance attribute instead of a local variable inside the `_engine` function.

### Corrected version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference to self as an instance attribute
    self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference as `self._period_weakref`, we ensure that the reference to `self` is retained, preventing premature garbage collection and resolving the issue with creating `PeriodEngine` objects correctly.
