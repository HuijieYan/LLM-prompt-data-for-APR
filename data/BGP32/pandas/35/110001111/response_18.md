### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class returns an instance of `_engine_type` initialized with a weak reference to `self` (`PeriodIndex` instance).
2. The issue reported on GitHub mentions that copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` loses weak references, leading to unexpected behavior when checking monotonicity.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object is dropped prematurely, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object (`self`) remains valid for the duration needed by the `_engine_type` instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The declaration of the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Keeping a strong reference to self before creating a weak reference
    self_ref = self
    period = weakref.ref(self_ref)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self_ref))
```

In the corrected version, we store a strong reference to `self` before creating a weak reference to ensure that the `PeriodIndex` object is not prematurely deallocated. This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to losing weak references when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`.
