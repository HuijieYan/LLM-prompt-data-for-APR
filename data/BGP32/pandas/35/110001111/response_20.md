### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` (which is a `PeriodIndex` instance) and then passing that weak reference to `_engine_type()` method. The purpose seems to be avoiding a reference cycle.
2. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` causes the weak references to be lost, resulting in an error.
3. The runtime input `self` is a `PeriodIndex` instance, and the expected output should preserve the weak reference.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the weak reference created in the `_engine` function not being properly maintained when the `PeriodIndex` is copied to create a `MultiIndex`. This leads to the loss of weak references and causes unexpected behavior.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the weak reference is used to ensure its persistence even after copying the `PeriodIndex`. One way to achieve this is by storing the weak reference outside of the `_engine` function so that it remains valid even after the `PeriodIndex` is copied.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _engine(self):
    # Store a weak reference to self outside the function
    self_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    
    def engine_type():
        return self._engine_type(self_weakref, len(self))  # Pass the weak reference to engine_type
        
    return engine_type
``` 

By storing the weak reference `self_weakref` outside the `_engine` function, we ensure that it remains valid even after the `PeriodIndex` is copied, preventing the loss of weak references when creating `MultiIndex` levels.
