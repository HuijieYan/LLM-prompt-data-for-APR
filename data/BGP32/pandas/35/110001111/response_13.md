### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class returns an instance of `_engine_type` initialized with a weak reference of `self` (a `PeriodIndex` object) and the length of `self`.
2. The issue reported on GitHub describes a scenario where copying levels of a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` loses weakrefs, resulting in errors due to a dropped weakly referenced `PeriodIndex`.
3. The cause of the bug seems to be related to the handling of weak references within the `_engine` function, leading to a None being passed to the `_engine_type` constructor in certain scenarios.
4. To fix the bug, we should ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained properly throughout the `_engine` function's execution.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to properly maintain the weak reference to `self` throughout the `_engine` function. One possible approach is to store the weak reference immediately after creating it and use it when needed during the function's execution. This ensures that the weak reference remains valid until it is no longer needed.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference to self
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    # Pass the stored weak reference to _engine_type
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

This corrected version ensures that the weak reference to `self` remains valid throughout the execution of the `_engine` function, addressing the issue of losing weakrefs during certain operations.
