## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class should return an instance of `self._engine_type`, passing a weak reference of `self` and the length of the `PeriodIndex`.
2. The bug seems to stem from incorrectly setting a weak reference to `self`, leading to a potential reference cycle issue.
3. The function should return an instance of `self._engine_type` that correctly uses the weak reference to `self`. This will resolve issues related to weak references in `PeriodIndex`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correctly create and use the weak reference to `self` in the function.

## Bug Fix:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)).__self__
``` 

By using `.__self__`, we ensure the weak reference is correctly handled without losing the reference to the original `self` object. This fix should address the issue with weak references in the `PeriodIndex` class.
