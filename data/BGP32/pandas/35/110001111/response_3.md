### Analysis:
1. The `cache_readonly` decorator is used to cache the return value of the `_engine` function to optimize performance by avoiding redundant computations.
2. The `_engine` function returns an instance of `_engine_type` class, passing a weak reference of the `self` object (PeriodIndex instance) to it.
3. The bug seems to be related to the weak reference handling, where the weak reference might not be retained properly, leading to `None` being passed to `_engine_type`.
4. This bug could result in unexpected behavior or errors when the weak reference to the `self` object becomes `None`.

### Bug Cause:
The `PeriodIndex` instance is being passed as a weak reference to the `_engine_type`, but the weak reference is not implemented correctly, leading to it being lost and replaced with `None`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `self` object (PeriodIndex instance) is properly retained throughout the `_engine` function's lifecycle.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Retain a strong reference to self while passing a weakref to engine_type
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

In the corrected version, we use `weakref.proxy(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` but retain a strong reference to it within the `_engine` function scope, ensuring that the weak reference remains valid during the call to `_engine_type`.
