### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function**: The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is meant to return an instance of `_engine_type` with a weak reference to the `self` object.
   
2. **Test Code**: The `test_get_level_values_when_periods` test in the `test_get_level_values.py` module creates a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` and attempts to check if all levels are monotonic.

3. **Error Message**: The error occurs when trying to access the `.view("i8")` attribute on a `NoneType` object. This suggests that a reference to the `PeriodIndex` is lost within the `_engine` function, leading to the issue.

4. **GitHub Issue**: The issue mentions that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped prematurely, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely due to the premature dropping of the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object in the `_engine` function, leading to a `NoneType` received by the `PeriodEngine`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained throughout the lifetime of the `_engine` function's execution.

### Corrected Code:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Using a class method to encapsulate weak reference creation
    def weak_period(ref):
        return self._engine_type(ref, len(self))
    
    # Create a weak reference to self inside a wrapper function
    weak_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    
    # Return the result of the _engine_type constructor
    return weak_period(weak_ref)
```

By using a wrapper function to encapsulate the weak reference creation and passing the weak reference to the `_engine_type` constructor, we ensure that the `PeriodIndex` object is not lost prematurely, resolving the issue.
