### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class.
2. The function uses `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to itself and then passes it to `_engine_type` but does not handle the case when the weak reference is no longer valid.
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` with a `PeriodIndex`, copies the level values, and checks if they are monotonic. The error occurs when checking for monotonicity, indicating an issue with the weak reference handling.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is still valid when accessed within the `_engine` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the weak reference to `self` becoming invalid when accessed in the `_engine` function. When the weak reference `period` is created and then accessed later inside `_engine`, if the referenced object (in this case, `self` - the `PeriodIndex` instance) has been garbage collected, `weakref.ref(self)` will return `None`, leading to the error `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` remains valid throughout the `_engine` function. One way to achieve this is by storing a strong reference to `self` within the `_engine` function. This way, even if `self` is garbage collected, the `_engine` function will hold a reference to it.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected version of the _engine function with fix for weak reference handling
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a strong reference to self
    self_ref = self
    return self._engine_type(self_ref, len(self))
```

By storing a strong reference to `self` within `_engine`, we ensure that the `PeriodIndex` instance remains reachable, preventing the weak reference from becoming invalid.
