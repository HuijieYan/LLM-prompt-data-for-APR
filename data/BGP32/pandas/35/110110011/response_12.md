### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function Relation:**
   - The buggy function `_engine` is a method of the `PeriodIndex` class.
  
2. **Error Location:**
   - The error seems to be related to the weak reference of `self` within the `_engine` method. The weak reference might be lost before it is intended to be used.
  
3. **Cause of Bug:**
   - The `_engine` method is attempting to create a weak reference to `self` (an instance of `PeriodIndex`) and then pass that weak reference to `_engine_type`. However, due to how weak references work and potential garbage collection, the weak reference might be lost prematurely, leading to `NoneType` errors when accessing attributes like `view`.
   - This is evident from the error message which shows an `AttributeError` for trying to access `view` on a `NoneType` object.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**
   - One possible fix could be to store the weak reference explicitly as an attribute of the `PeriodIndex` instance to ensure it remains alive as long as needed.
   - Another approach could involve managing the weak reference with care, ensuring it is still available when `_engine_type` is accessed.
   
5. **Corrected Version:**
```python
from pandas.core.arrays.period import PeriodEngine

class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    # Other class code...

    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Store weak reference explicitly to ensure its availability
        self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))

# Add an appropriate implementation to the PeriodEngine class (not shown here for brevity)
class PeriodEngine:
    def __init__(self, period_weakref, length):
        self._period_weakref = period_weakref
        self._length = length

    # Add the necessary methods/functions here...
```

This corrected version aims to maintain the weak reference to `self` throughout the usage of `_engine` to prevent the premature loss of the reference. Make sure to update the `PeriodEngine` class implementation accordingly for it to work properly.
