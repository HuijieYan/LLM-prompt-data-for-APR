### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is causing an error when trying to access `self._engine_type` due to a weak reference issue.
2. The error is related to the weak reference not being maintained properly, leading to a `NoneType` error when accessing the `_engine_type`.
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is trying to check if the levels of a `MultiIndex` are monotonic, but the weak reference handling in `PeriodIndex` is causing the error.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained properly when creating the `_engine` function.

### Proposed Fix:
To address the weak reference issue, we need to modify the implementation of the `_engine` function to correctly handle the weak reference to `self`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected Version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `period()` is used to get the actual object from the weak reference `period`. This ensures that the weak reference does not become `None`, resolving the bug and allowing the test to pass successfully.
