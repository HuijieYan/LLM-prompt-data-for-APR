### Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class. The issue arises due to the weak reference not being properly maintained, causing the `_engine` function to receive `NoneType` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`. This leads to an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute.

### Bug Cause:
- The `_engine` function is using a weak reference called `period` to itself, but the weak reference is not maintained correctly, leading to it being dropped prematurely.
- When accessing `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, the `period` reference is already invalid, resulting in a `NoneType` error.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the weak reference `period` needs to be maintained correctly throughout the lifetime of the `PeriodIndex` instance, ensuring it remains valid when accessed within the `_engine` function.

### Corrected Version:

```python
# Corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```

### Summary:
By maintaining the weak reference to the `self` object properly in the `_engine` function, we ensure that the `PeriodIndex` instance remains accessible throughout the function's execution. This correction resolves the `NoneType` error and allows the function to work as intended.
