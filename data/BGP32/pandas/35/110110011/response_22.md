### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class is meant to return an instance of the `_engine_type` class with a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance.
- The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` tries to create `MultiIndex` objects from a `PeriodIndex` object, which results in an error due to the weak reference handling in the `_engine` method.
- The error message indicates that a `NoneType` object has no attribute 'view', suggesting that the weak reference handling might be causing the reference to be lost.
- The GitHub issue points out that copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` results in the loss of weak references and causes the error.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the weak reference handling within the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class. When creating a `MultiIndex` object from a `PeriodIndex` object, weak references are not maintained correctly, resulting in a `NoneType` object being passed to the `_engine_type` constructor.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance is properly maintained throughout the lifecycle of the `_engine` object. This can be achieved by modifying the way the weak reference is stored and accessed within the `_engine` method.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weak_period, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, a weak reference to `self` is stored in the `weak_period` variable before passing it to the `_engine_type` constructor. This ensures that the weak reference is maintained correctly and prevents the issue of passing a `NoneType` object.
