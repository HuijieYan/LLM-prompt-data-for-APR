### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is meant to return an instance of `self._engine_type` class using a weak reference to avoid a reference cycle.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `PeriodIndex` and then tries to access the `is_monotonic` property of the levels in a `MultiIndex`.
3. The failing test leads to the error `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, indicating that the weak reference in the `_engine` function might not be working correctly.
4. The GitHub issue states that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` er dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to get a `None` instead of a `PeriodIndex`.
   
### Strategy for fixing the bug:
The issue seems related to how the weak reference `period` is being used in the `_engine` function. To resolve this issue, the weak reference needs to be handled carefully to ensure it does not get dropped prematurely.

### Corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```

By directly returning the `weakref.ref(self)` instead of assigning it to a variable, we can ensure that the weak reference remains valid throughout the usage of the `_engine` function.

This corrected version should help avoid premature dropping of the weak reference, resolving the `NoneType` error encountered in the failing test.
