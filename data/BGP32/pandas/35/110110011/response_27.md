### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class is meant to return an instance of the `_engine_type` class by passing a weak reference of the `PeriodIndex` object to it.
2. The error occurs when accessing the `view` attribute on a `NoneType` object within the `_engine_type` instance.
3. The failing test is checking if the created `MultiIndex` object has monotonic levels by checking `is_monotonic_increasing` but encounters the error due to a `NoneType` object.
4. The GitHub issue points out that weak references are dropped earlier than expected, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

### Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained until the `_engine` function is used and that the creation of the `PeriodEngine` instance is handled correctly to avoid the `NoneType` error.

### Corrected Code:
```python
# Fixing the buggy function to maintain the weak reference until used
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))

# Correcting the PeriodEngine class to handle NoneType issue
class PeriodEngine(lru_cache=True):
    def __init__(self, period, length):
        self.period = period
        self.length = length
        super().__init__()

    def is_monotonic_increasing(self):
        return super().is_monotonic_increasing if self.period is not None else False

# Applying the fix to the buggy class
@cache_readonly 
def _engine_type(period, length):
    return PeriodEngine(period, length)
```

After applying this corrected version of the code, the `NoneType` error should be resolved, and the failing test should now pass as expected.
