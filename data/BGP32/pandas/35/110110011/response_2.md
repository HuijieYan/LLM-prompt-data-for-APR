### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class is causing an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error.
2. The error occurs because the `_engine` function returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, but `period` is a weak reference, and it appears to lose reference unexpectedly.
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` attempts to check if the values are monotonic, revealing the issue when calling `is_monotonic` on weakly referenced data.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is maintained correctly to prevent it from being garbage collected prematurely.
5. The corrected version should retain the reference correctly to avoid the `NoneType` error.

### Correction:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)  # Keep a weak reference to self
    result = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    self._engine_ref = period  # Assign weak reference to an instance attribute
    return result
```

By keeping a reference to the weak reference `period` in the `self._engine_ref` attribute, we ensure that the `PeriodIndex` instance does not lose its reference prematurely. This correction should resolve the `NoneType` error and allow the test to pass successfully.
