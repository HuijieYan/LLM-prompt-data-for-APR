### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class is trying to return an instance of `self._engine_type`. It uses `weakref.ref(self)` to avoid reference cycles, but the issue arises in generating `period` as a weak reference.
2. The error message is indicating that a 'NoneType' object is being encountered when trying to access the 'view' attribute, which implies that the weak reference is not working as intended.
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is attempting to check if all levels in the `idx2` MultiIndex are monotonic, and it fails due to the weak reference issue.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is correctly created and utilized to avoid the reference cycle and issue with the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex`.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Avoid a reference cycle with a weak reference of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period if period is not None else self, len(self))
```

By modifying the return statement in the `_engine` function to handle the case where `period` is `None`, we make sure that the weak reference creation is working correctly. This change will allow the `PeriodIndex` to be weakly referenced as intended.
