### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is intended to return an engine instance with weak reference to `self` passed to `_engine_type`. This weak reference is required to avoid a reference cycle.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` using `PeriodIndex` and checks if all levels are monotonic.
3. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` where the `PeriodEngine` is trying to access an attribute on a `NoneType` object, suggesting that the weak reference to `self` is not correctly passed to the engine.
4. The GitHub issue also mentions that weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before intended, leading to a `None` being passed to the engine.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused because the weak reference `period` is not properly handled or passed to the `self._engine_type` constructor, resulting in the `None` object passed to the engine.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, ensure that the weak reference to `self` (`period`) is correctly passed to the engine constructor to avoid the `None` object issue.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self), self.freq)
```

By passing `self.freq` along with the weak reference `period`, we can ensure that the weak reference is not lost, and the engine gets the proper `PeriodIndex` instance. This should resolve the `NoneType` attribute error and pass the failing test.
