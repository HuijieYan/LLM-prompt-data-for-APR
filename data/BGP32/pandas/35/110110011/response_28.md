### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, where `self._engine_type` is expected to receive a weak reference of `self` to avoid reference cycles. However, a direct reference is passed instead, which causes the weak reference to be broken.
- This bug is causing an `AttributeError` when accessing `view("i8") on a`NoneType` object, observed in the failing test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods`.


### Bug Cause:
- The bug is due to the direct passing of `self` instead of a weak reference in the `_engine` function. This results in the weak reference not being correctly maintained, leading to a `NoneType` object where attributes cannot be accessed.


### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug:
1. Ensure that `weakref` is correctly imported.
2. Modify the `_engine` function to pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type` by using `weakref.ref(self)` instead of `self`.
3. This will maintain the weak reference, preventing the reference cycle issue.

### Corrected Version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By making this change, the bug should be resolved, and the failing test should pass successfully.
