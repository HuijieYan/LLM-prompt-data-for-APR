## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class in `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` is causing an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view("i8")` attribute.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` from `pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py` is trying to assert the monotonicity of the levels in `idx2`, which leads to the faulty `_engine` method being called.
3. The error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` is getting a `NoneType` object instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.
4. The GitHub issue states that there is an issue with weak references being dropped prematurely, causing the error.

## Bug Description:
The bug occurs when the weak reference (`period`) to the `PeriodIndex` instance is being passed to the `_engine_type` constructor, but the weak reference is not properly maintained, leading to a `NoneType` error when trying to access the `view("i8")` attribute.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance is correctly handled to prevent it from being dropped prematurely. This can be achieved by modifying the `_engine` method to maintain a strong reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance while creating the `PeriodEngine`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, the method `period()` is called immediately to obtain a strong reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance before passing it to the `_engine_type` constructor. This change ensures that the instance does not get garbage collected prematurely, resolving the `NoneType` error.
