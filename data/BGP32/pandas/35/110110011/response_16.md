### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function**: The `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class.
2. **Relationship**:
   - The function `_engine` is a cached read-only property that returns an instance of the `_engine_type` class, passing a weak reference of the `PeriodIndex` object.
   - The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates `MultiIndex` objects which utilize a `PeriodIndex` with levels accessed for `is_monotonic` check.
   - The error is triggered by the weak reference issue with `PeriodEngine` in `_do_monotonic_check`.
   - The GitHub issue highlights the problem where the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped earlier than expected.
3. **Errors**:
   - The error message indicates an `AttributeError` due to a `NoneType` object not having the attribute `view`.
   - The root cause is the premature dropping of the weak reference leading to `PeriodEngine` receiving `None`.
4. **Fix Strategy**:
   - Ensure the weak reference to `PeriodIndex` object is maintained throughout to avoid premature deallocation.
   - Adjust the lifecycle of the weak reference to align with the usage within `PeriodEngine`.
5. **Solution**:

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    # Preserve the weak reference outside the function scope
    self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    # Ensure the weak reference is available during _engine_type instantiation
    return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

By preserving the weak reference outside the function scope, we maintain the object reference until the `_engine_type` instance is created, resolving the premature deallocation issue.
