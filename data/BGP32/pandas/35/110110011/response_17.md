### Analysis:
- **Buggy Function**: The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is causing issues due to weak reference handling.
- **Buggy Class**: The `PeriodIndex` class in `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` is where the buggy function resides.
- **Failing Test**: The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` in `pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py` is checking the monotonicity of levels in a `MultiIndex` consisting of `Period` objects.
- **Error Message**: The error message indicates an `AttributeError` caused by a `NoneType` object not having the attribute 'view'.
- **GitHub Issue**: The issue on GitHub describes a problem where weak references in `PeriodIndex` levels are lost, leading to errors when assessing monotonicity in a `MultiIndex`.

### Identified Issue:
The issue arises from weak reference handling in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class, resulting in a `NoneType` object being provided to the `PeriodEngine`, which causes attribute lookup errors.

### Suggested Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug, ensure that the weak reference is handled correctly in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class so that the `PeriodEngine` receives a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# Update the buggy function to handle weak references properly
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if period() is None:  # Check if weak ref is still valid
        raise RuntimeError("Weak reference to 'PeriodIndex' is no longer valid.")
    return engine_type
```

By checking if the weak reference is still valid before proceeding with creating the `engine_type`, we can prevent passing a `NoneType` object and avoid attribute errors. This corrected version will ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` remains valid during the creation of the `engine_type`, resolving the issue described in the failing test and GitHub bug report.
