### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance, but it is not handling the weak reference correctly.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` involves creating a `PeriodIndex` with `Period` objects and checking if the levels are monotonic. However, due to the issue with weak references in the `_engine` function, it leads to an `AttributeError` when trying to access the weak reference in the test.
3. The error message indicates that a `NoneType` object is being encountered due to handling weak references improperly.
4. To fix the bug, the weak reference handling in the `_engine` function needs to be corrected to ensure that the weak reference does not get lost or lead to a `NoneType` reference.
5. The corrected version of the `_engine` function should properly handle the weak reference to avoid the error.

### Bug Fix:
```python
# Corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Pass the weak reference to the PeriodEngine constructor directly
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

By utilizing `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we ensure that the weak reference retains a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance, avoiding the `NoneType` issue. This correction should resolve the weak reference problem and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
