## Analysis
- The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` function within the `PeriodIndex` class.
- It returns an instance of `_engine_type` with weak reference to `self` (PeriodIndex object) passed to it.
- The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` in the file `test_get_level_values.py` checks if the levels of a `MultiIndex` are monotonic by calling `is_monotonic` on each level, which in turn calls `is_monotonic_increasing`, leading to the `_engine` invocation causing the AttributeError.
- The error occurs due to `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, where `period` being a weak reference, might not actually point to an instance when `_engine_type` tries to access it.

## Bug Cause
- The bug occurs due to the use of `weakref.ref(self)` inside the `_engine` function. When the `PeriodEngine` tries to access the weakly referenced `self`, it is getting a `NoneType` object, leading to the AttributeError.

## Fix Strategy
- To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weakly referenced `self` object remains valid when `_engine_type` tries to access it.
- One way to achieve this is by holding a strong reference to the `self` object while `_engine` is computed and passing it to `_engine_type`.

## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
# Fix for the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Hold a strong reference to 'self' while computing _engine
    current_self = self
    period = weakref.ref(current_self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By holding a strong reference to `self` (`current_self`) before creating the weak reference, we ensure that the `period` variable does not become `NoneType` when accessed by `_engine_type`. This fix should resolve the AttributeError issue reported in the GitHub bug.
