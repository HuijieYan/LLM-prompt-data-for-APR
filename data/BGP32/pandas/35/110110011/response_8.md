## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is causing an `AttributeError` due to a `NoneType` object trying to access the `view` attribute. This error is detected in the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` when checking the monotonicity of values in the `idx2` levels of the `MultiIndex`.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused because the weak reference in the `_engine` function of `PeriodIndex` class is not properly being passed to `_engine_type`. This leads to the `period` variable pointing to `None` instead of the intended referenced object.

## Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to correctly pass the weak reference object to `_engine_type` so that it can properly handle the reference to the `PeriodIndex`. By updating the `_engine` function accordingly, we can ensure that the weak reference is maintained correctly throughout the execution.

## Corrected Function
The corrected version of the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By modifying the `_engine` function to use `period()` instead of simply `period`, we ensure that the weak reference is properly dereferenced to get the actual object referenced by `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`.

This correction will resolve the `NoneType` object attribute error and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
