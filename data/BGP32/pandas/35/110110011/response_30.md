### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is trying to create an instance of `_engine_type` by passing a weak reference of `self` as `period`.
2. The error message from the failing test indicates an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, which suggests that the instance being created with `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` is actually `None`.
3. The GitHub issue mentions that weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before intended, causing `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

### Bug Cause:
The weak reference `period` is not being properly maintained, resulting in the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being garbage collected prematurely, leading to `None` being passed to `_engine_type`.

### Fix Strategy:
To resolve the issue, the weak reference `period` to `self` needs to be stored in a module-level variable or an attribute of the class to ensure that the weak reference is maintained throughout the lifecycle of the object.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from pandas.util._decorators import Appender, cache_readonly, doc

# The buggy class declaration
@inherit_names(['strftime', 'to_timestamp', 'asfreq', 'start_time', 'end_time'] + PeriodArray._field_ops, PeriodArray, wrap=True)
@inherit_names(['is_leap_year', 'freq', '_format_native_types'], PeriodArray)
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    """
    Immutable ndarray holding ordinal values indicating regular periods in time.

    Index keys are boxed to Period objects which carries the metadata (eg,
    frequency information).

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : array-like (1d int np.ndarray or PeriodArray), optional
        Optional period-like data to construct index with.
    copy : bool
        Make a copy of input ndarray.
    freq : str or period object, optional
        One of pandas period strings or corresponding objects.
    year : int, array, or Series, default None
...

    # The corrected version of the buggy function
    period = None

    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, store the weakref of self in a class attribute.
        if PeriodIndex.period is None:
            PeriodIndex.period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(PeriodIndex.period, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference to `self` in a class-level attribute `period`, we ensure that the reference is not prematurely garbage collected. This modification should fix the issue described in the failing test and the GitHub bug report.
