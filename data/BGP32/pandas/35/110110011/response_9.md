### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is attempting to use a weak reference to avoid a reference cycle, but it is not implemented correctly.
2. The error message indicates that an AttributeError occurs because the `self._engine` returns a `NoneType` when trying to access the `view("i8")` attribute.
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is checking if the levels in the `MultiIndex` are monotonic, but due to the bug in the `_engine` function, the weak reference is not being maintained properly.
4. To fix the bug, the weak reference implementation in the `_engine` function needs to be updated to maintain the reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance correctly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the weak reference `period` is not properly stored or implemented in the `_engine` function. When trying to access the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` instance, it results in a `NoneType` object, causing the attribute error.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the implementation of the weak reference in the `_engine` function should be corrected to maintain a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance. This can be achieved by ensuring that the weak reference is accessed and stored correctly for the duration needed within the function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By modifying the `period` to `period()`, the function will access the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` instance correctly and prevent the `NoneType` attribute error. This correction should resolve the bug and allow the failing test to pass as expected.
