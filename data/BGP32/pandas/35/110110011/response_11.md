### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class attempts to use weak references to avoid circular references.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` consisting of a `PeriodIndex` and then checks if the levels are monotonic using the `is_monotonic` property.
3. The error message indicates that an 'AttributeError' occurs because a 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'.
4. The GitHub issue points out that weak references are being lost, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

### Bug Cause:
The weak reference to `self` is not utilized correctly, leading to the loss of the reference. This results in a `NoneType` object being accessed, causing the error.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained properly throughout the function.

### Corrected Code:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if period() is not None else None
```

By explicitly checking if the weak reference still exists before using it to create the `PeriodEngine`, we can prevent the error caused by accessing a `NoneType` object. This fix retains the weak reference and avoids the loss of the reference causing the bug.
