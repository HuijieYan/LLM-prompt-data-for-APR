### Analysis:
- **Buggy Function Relation:** The `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class is used to create the engine type with a weak reference to the `self` object.
- **Test Code:** The failing test involves creating a `MultiIndex` with `PeriodIndex` levels and then checking if the levels are monotonic.
- **Error Message:** The error message indicates that a `NoneType` object has no attribute 'view'.
- **GitHub Issue:** The issue indicates that weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` data is being dropped prematurely.
  
### Error Cause:
- The `_engine` function is returning `None` instead of the expected engine type, causing the `NoneType` object error.
- The premature dropping of weak reference data is due to the way the weak reference is implemented in the `_engine` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Adjust the `_engine` function to correctly utilize the weak reference and ensure it maintains the reference during its usage.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return super(PeriodIndex, self)._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By calling `super(PeriodIndex, self)._engine_type`, we ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained correctly while creating the engine type, resolving the issue of getting a `NoneType` error.
