### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is being defined in the `PeriodIndex` class of the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file.
2. The test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` from `pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py` file expects that the `is_monotonic` property of the levels in `idx2` should return `True`. However, it fails due to an `AttributeError`.
3. The error message indicates that the `AttributeError` occurs due to a `NoneType` object not having the attribute `view`. This points to an issue in the `_engine_type` function.
4. The GitHub issue confirms that weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped unintentionally, leading to the `None` object issue in `PeriodEngine`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the premature dropping of the weak reference to `self` in the `_engine` function, resulting in `None` being passed to `_engine_type` and eventually causing the `AttributeError`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` (`PeriodIndex` object) is maintained until the `_engine_type` function is called. We can do this by creating a strong reference to `self` before passing it as a weak reference to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a strong reference of self to _engine_type.
    period = self
    weakref_obj = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weakref_obj, len(self))
```

By creating a strong reference `period` before creating the weak reference `weakref_obj`, we ensure that the `PeriodIndex` object is not prematurely released, thus resolving the issue.
