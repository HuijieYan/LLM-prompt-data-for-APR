### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `@cache_readonly` function in the `PeriodIndex` class that tries to return an instance of `_engine_type` by passing a weak reference of `self` (PeriodIndex instance) to it.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` tries to create a `MultiIndex` using `PeriodIndex` with a reference to a period object and then checks for monotonicity of the levels through `is_monotonic`, leading to an `AttributeError`.
3. The error occurs due to the weak reference of `self` (`PeriodIndex`) being dropped prematurely before it can be used by `_engine_type`, leading to a `NoneType` error in the engine.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained throughout the usage of the engine.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `_engine` function to store the weak reference of `self` in a class attribute to ensure it persists.
2. Update the `_engine_type` constructor to handle the weak reference correctly.

### Corrected Version of the `PeriodIndex` class:
```python
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    """
    Immutable ndarray holding ordinal values indicating regular periods in time.
    ...
    """

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)

    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Ensure weak reference to self is retained
        return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

By modifying the `PeriodIndex` class as shown above, the weak reference to `self` (`PeriodIndex`) will be correctly maintained, preventing the `NoneType` error in the engine.

This fix should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
