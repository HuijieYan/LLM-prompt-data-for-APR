### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref` to assign a weak reference of the `self` object. However, the usage seems incorrect and is leading to an `AttributeError` in the failing test.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` tries to assert that all levels in a `MultiIndex` created from a `PeriodIndex` object are monotonic, but it fails due to the issue with the weak reference handling in the `_engine` function.
3. The error message indicates that an `AttributeError` is raised because the `NoneType` object does not have the `view` attribute. This points to the weak reference not being correctly passed to the `PeriodEngine`.
4. The GitHub issue mentioned weak references being dropped prematurely, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the `weakref.ref(self)` in the `_engine` function should be changed to use `weakref.proxy(self)` instead, which would create a proxy object that behaves like the original object but allows weak referencing without affecting the object itself.

### Corrected Version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weak proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By replacing `weakref.ref(self)` with `weakref.proxy(self)`, we ensure that a weak proxy reference is used instead of a weak reference, which should fix the issue with premature dropping of weak references.
