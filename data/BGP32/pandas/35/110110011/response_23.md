### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine(self)` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance to avoid a reference cycle.
2. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` with the message `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` tries to create a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` and then asserts the monotonic property, causing the error due to the weak reference handling in the `_engine` function.
4. The bug is causing the weak reference to be lost, leading to a `NoneType` being used instead of the expected `PeriodIndex` instance. This results in an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute.
5. To fix the bug, the weak reference handling needs to be revised to ensure that the reference is not lost prematurely.

### Bug Fix:
Here is a corrected version of the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class:

```python
# Updated and corrected _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    def create_weakref():
        return weakref.ref(self)
    
    period = create_weakref()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By encapsulating the weak reference creation in a separate function `create_weakref()`, we ensure that the weak reference is created at the right time when `_engine` is called, thus preventing premature loss of the reference.

With this fix, the weak reference should be properly maintained, resolving the `AttributeError` seen in the failing test.
