### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`.
2. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` for `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` which suggests that the `weakref.ref(self)` operation is not functioning correctly due to the weak reference being lost or not correctly handled.
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` triggers the issue by creating a `MultiIndex` with a `PeriodIndex` and trying to access its levels which depend on `is_monotonic`, causing the error due to the weak reference being lost.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until it is used within `_engine_type`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Maintain the weak reference to `self` in the `_engine` function until it is passed to `_engine_type` to avoid losing the reference prematurely.
2. Ensure that the weak reference remains valid during the lifespan of the `_engine` function to prevent the `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, a weak reference to `self` is directly passed to `_engine_type` without storing it in a separate variable. This modification ensures that the weak reference is maintained until it is used by `_engine_type`, resolving the issue of premature weak reference loss. The corrected version should now pass the failing test and address the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
