### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is used in the `PeriodIndex` class. The function creates a weak reference to `self` (the instance of `PeriodIndex`) and returns an instance of `_engine_type` initialized with this weak reference and the length of `self`.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` and then attempts to check if the levels are monotonic. This test fails with an AttributeError due to the `_engine` function returning a `NoneType` object instead of the expected `_engine_type` instance.
3. The error message indicates that the issue lies in `pandas/_libs/index.pyx`, specifically at the line where `return super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter().view("i8")` is called. This implies that the `_engine` method is not returning the correct object.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the weak reference problem in the `PeriodIndex` class causing the PeriodEngine to receive a `None` object instead of the intended weak reference to `self`.
5. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` in the `_engine` function is correctly handled and that the `PeriodEngine` initializes with the correct reference.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `_engine` method to properly create a weak reference to `self`.
2. Ensure that the correct object is returned and passed to the `PeriodEngine`.
3. Update the `PeriodEngine` constructor to handle the weak reference correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    weakself = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weakself, len(self))
```

By updating the `_engine` method to correctly create a weak reference to `self` and passing this reference to the `PeriodEngine` constructor, the bug should be resolved, and the failing test should pass.
