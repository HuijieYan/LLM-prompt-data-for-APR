### Analysis
1. The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is using a weak reference to avoid a reference cycle.
2. The buggy line is trying to create a weak reference to `self`, but it is not being stored in a variable.
3. The bug causes the weak reference to `self` to be garbage collected immediately, leading to incorrect behavior when `_engine_type` is called with the weak reference.
4. The fix involves storing the weak reference in a variable that has a longer scope, preventing it from being garbage collected.

### Fix
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
