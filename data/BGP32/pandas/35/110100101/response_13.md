### Strategy for fixing the bug
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is not the correct approach. Instead, the `_engine` function should simply return the `_engine_type` class initialized with `self` and the length of the index.

### The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
