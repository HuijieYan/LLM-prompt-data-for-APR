### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_engine` function is caused by the incorrect usage of `period` to create a weak reference. The `period` variable should store the weak reference object itself, not a weak reference to `self`.

### Fix Strategy
We need to modify the line `period = weakref.ref(self)` to correctly create a weak reference to `self`. This can be done by directly passing `self` to `weakref.ref()`.

### Corrected Function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```
