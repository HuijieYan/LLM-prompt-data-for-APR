### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is currently using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance. However, the `_engine_type` constructor expects a direct reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance rather than a weak reference.

### Bug
The bug in the current implementation is that the `_engine` function is returning a weak reference to `self` instead of the actual reference. This will lead to issues when creating the `_engine_type` object.

### Fix
To fix this bug, the `_engine` function should return the direct reference to `self` instead of a weak reference.

### Corrected Version
```python
    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
