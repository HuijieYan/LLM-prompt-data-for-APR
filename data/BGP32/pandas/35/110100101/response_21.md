### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`, but it's not being dereferenced correctly when passing it to `_engine_type`. This can cause issues with circular references and memory leaks.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_engine` function is causing a weak reference cycle, which may lead to unexpected behavior and memory leaks in certain scenarios. The weak reference should be dereferenced properly to avoid this issue.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to dereference the weak reference `period` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This can be achieved by calling `period()` to get the actual object referenced by the weak reference.

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
