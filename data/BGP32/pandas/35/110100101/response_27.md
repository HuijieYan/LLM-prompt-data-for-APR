### Strategy for fixing the bug
The issue seems to be related to the `_engine()` function not correctly passing a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type` constructor. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that a weak reference of `self` is correctly passed to `_engine_type` constructor.

### Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
