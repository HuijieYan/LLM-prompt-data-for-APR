Based on the analysis, the bug in the `_engine` function is caused by incorrectly creating a weak reference to `self` which does not prevent the reference cycle as intended. To fix this issue, we need to use the `weakref.proxy` function instead of `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.proxy(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we create a weak reference that accurately prevents the reference cycle, thereby addressing the bug in the function.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test case provided.
