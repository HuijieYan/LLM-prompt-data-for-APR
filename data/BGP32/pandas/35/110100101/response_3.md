The bug in the `_engine` function lies in the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`. The correct way to create a weak reference is by using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead.

Explanation of the bug:
When the `_engine` function is called, it creates a weak reference to `self` using `weakref.ref(self)` instead of `weakref.proxy(self)`. This leads to a situation where `period` is a weak reference object, which needs to be explicitly called to access the underlying object (in this case, `self`), resulting in a `TypeError` when `self` is used later in the code.

To fix this bug, we need to replace `weakref.ref(self)` with `weakref.proxy(self)` in the `_engine` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

This fix ensures that `period` is a weak reference proxy to `self`, allowing seamless access to the underlying object without explicitly calling it.
