### Strategy for fixing the bug
The bug in the `_engine` function is related to the creation of a weak reference to `self`. In this case, instead of using `weakref.ref(self)`, it would be better to use `weakref.proxy(self)` to create a weak proxy reference to avoid the reference cycle issue.

### Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weak proxy reference of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
