### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is supposed to return an instance of `_engine_type` using a weak reference to `self` (an instance of `PeriodIndex`).
2. The bug seems to be with how the weak reference `period` is being used in the `return` statement.
3. The test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` instance from a `PeriodIndex` and then tries to access the level values. The test is indicating that the buggy function `_engine` is causing issues that may not be necessary.
4. To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the weak reference `period` and prevent any potential reference cycles that may occur.

### Bug Cause
The bug in the `_engine` function arises from passing a weak reference `period` to `_engine_type` instead of the actual `self` reference. This could lead to incorrect behavior when `_engine_type` is trying to access `len(self)` from the weak reference.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the actual `self` reference is passed to `_engine_type` for proper initialization. We can achieve this by dereferencing the weak reference `period` before passing it to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Dereference the weak reference before passing to _engine_type
        return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```
