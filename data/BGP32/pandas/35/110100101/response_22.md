### Analyzing the buggy function
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` and passing it to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`. However, the `PeriodIndex` class inherits from `Int64Index`, which may not be handling the weak reference properly. This could lead to unexpected behavior when constructing the `_engine` object in `PeriodIndex`.

### Cause of the bug
The bug lies in the way the weak reference is created and passed in `_engine`. The weak reference might not be preserved correctly, leading to issues when using it to construct the engine object.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
Instead of creating a weak reference to `self` directly, we can handle the weak reference creation and usage differently to ensure that it is maintained correctly throughout the object's lifetime.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
from weakref import WeakMethod

class _WeakPeriodIndexRef:
    def __init__(self, obj):
        self.ref = WeakMethod(obj)
    
    def __call__(self):
        return self.ref()
    
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    # Other class definitions here

    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        period_ref = _WeakPeriodIndexRef(self)
        return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we created a custom `_WeakPeriodIndexRef` class that maintains a weak reference to `self` using `WeakMethod`. This ensures that the weak reference is properly handled when creating the engine object.

By using this custom weak reference object, we can fix the issue related to the weak reference handling in the `_engine` function.
