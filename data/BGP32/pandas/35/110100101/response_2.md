The bug in the `_engine` function lies in the use of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`. This implementation does not store the weak reference object in a variable, causing the weak reference to go out of scope immediately. As a result, when `_engine_type` tries to access the weak reference object, it may have been garbage collected and cause unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to store the weak reference object in a variable that remains in scope for the duration of the function call. By doing so, we ensure that the weak reference object is accessible when needed.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference object in a variable
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference object `period_ref` is preserved within the function scope and will be available for use by `_engine_type`. This should fix the issue and allow the function to work as intended without running into reference cycle problems.
