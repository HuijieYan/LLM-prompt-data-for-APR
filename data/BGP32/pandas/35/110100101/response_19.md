### Explanation
The bug in the `_engine` function is caused by the incorrect usage of weak reference. Weak reference is not being used correctly to avoid reference cycle. This leads to the reference to `self` not being properly retained, which causes the error.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should correctly utilize weak reference to avoid reference cycles. By passing a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`, the reference cycle can be avoided.

### The corrected version of the function

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

This correction ensures that a weak reference of `self` is properly passed to `_engine_type`, helping to avoid the reference cycle issue.
