The bug in the `_engine` function is that it is not correctly passing a weak reference of `self` to the `_engine_type` constructor. This can lead to potential reference cycle issues.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_engine` function to pass a weak reference of `self` to the `_engine_type` constructor.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By using `period()` instead of just `period`, we are invoking the weak reference and obtaining the actual `self` object before passing it to the `_engine_type` constructor.

This fix should resolve the reference cycle issue in the `_engine` function.
