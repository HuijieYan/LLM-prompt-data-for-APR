The bug in the `_engine` function is caused by incorrectly declaring `period` as a weak reference object using `weakref.ref(self)`. This results in `period` being a weak reference object, which causes the subsequent call to `_engine_type(period, len(self))` to fail due to an incorrect argument being passed.

To fix this bug, `period` should be assigned the actual value of `self` without using `weakref.ref()`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
``` 

This corrected version should fix the bug and pass the failing test case by correctly initializing the `_engine` function with the required arguments.
