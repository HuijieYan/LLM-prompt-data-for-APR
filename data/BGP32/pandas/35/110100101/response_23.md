### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is trying to create an instance of `_engine_type` by passing a weak reference of `self` (which is a `PeriodIndex`) and the length of the `PeriodIndex`. The issue seems to be related to how the weak reference is being passed to `_engine_type`.

### Bug Explanation
The bug lies in the way `weakref.ref()` is being used. The function `weakref.ref(self)` returns a weak reference object, not the actual object itself. Therefore, the weak reference object is being passed to `_engine_type` instead of the actual `PeriodIndex` object, causing issues.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to dereference the weak reference object before passing it to `_engine_type`. We can achieve this by calling the weak reference object with `()` which will return the actual object.

### Corrected Version
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))  # Dereference the weak reference object
```
