### Analysis
1. The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is supposed to return an instance of the `_engine_type` class, passing a weak reference of `self` and the length of `self` as arguments.
2. The bug lies in the implementation of creating a weak reference to `self` in the `_engine` function.
3. The cause of the bug is that the `weakref.ref(self)` creates a weak reference object, not the actual reference to `self`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to invoke the weak reference object to get the actual reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`.

### Correction
```python
def _engine(self):
    # Invoking the weak reference object to get the actual reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

### Updated Buggy Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Invoking the weak reference object to get the actual reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
