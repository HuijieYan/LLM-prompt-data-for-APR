The issue in the buggy function `_engine` lies in how it is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to the `self` object. The correct approach should be to pass the actual object `self` to `_engine_type` and let the garbage collector handle the reference cycle.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to pass `self` directly to `_engine_type` without creating a weak reference.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from pandas.util._decorators import cache_readonly

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

With this modification, the function now correctly passes `self` to `_engine_type` without creating a weak reference. This change should resolve the issue encountered in the failing test case `test_get_level_values_when_periods`.
