The cause of the bug is that the `_engine` function is using a weak reference to `self`, but then it is trying to access the length of `self` directly. This can lead to unexpected behavior since `self` might have been garbage collected by the time the weak reference is accessed.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `_engine` function to first retrieve the actual object from the weak reference and then access its length. This ensures that the object is still available when its length is being accessed.

Here is a corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    period_obj = period()
    if period_obj is None:
        raise RuntimeError("Weak reference to self is no longer available")
    return self._engine_type(period_obj, len(period_obj))
```

This corrected version first retrieves the object from the weak reference `period` using `period()` and stores it in `period_obj`. It then checks if `period_obj` is `None` and raises a `RuntimeError` if the weak reference is no longer available. Finally, it uses `period_obj` to access its length and create the engine type.

This fix ensures that the weak reference is correctly handled and the object is available when needed within the `_engine` function.
