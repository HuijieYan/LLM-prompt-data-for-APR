The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using a `weakref.ref` to reference `self`, which may lead to unexpected behavior. The intention is to avoid reference cycles, but the way it's implemented is incorrect.

The issue with the current implementation is that `weakref.ref(self)` creates a weak reference to `self`, which is not being used correctly when calling `_engine_type`. Instead, we should directly pass `self` to `_engine_type`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_engine` function to directly pass `self` to `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # directly pass self to _engine_type without using weakref
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

With this correction, the `self` parameter is correctly passed to `_engine_type` without creating a weak reference. This should fix the bug and make the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` pass as expected.
