### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object. The intention appears to be to avoid a reference cycle. However, the `_engine_type` function is then called with `period` and `len(self)` arguments, which are not directly usable for creating the necessary `_engine_type` object.

### Bug Explanation
The bug is that the `period` weak reference is passed to the `_engine_type` constructor along with the length of `self` (`len(self)`). This is incorrect because `_engine_type` expects a direct reference to `self` rather than a weak reference and a length value.

### Fix Strategy
Instead of passing `period, len(self)` to `_engine_type`, we should directly pass `self` to `_engine_type`. Since the goal is to avoid reference cycles while ensuring the availability of the `self` object, we can use a different approach to create the `_engine_type` object without the need for a weak reference.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
