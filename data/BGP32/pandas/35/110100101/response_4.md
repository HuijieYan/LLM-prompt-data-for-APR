The bug in the `_engine` function lies in the line where `weakref.ref(self)` is used. The `weakref.ref(self)` function creates a weak reference to the `self` object, which is supposed to help avoid reference cycles. However, the weak reference is not being properly utilized in the subsequent usage, leading to the possible garbage collection of the original `self` object. 

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to store the weak reference to `self` and then retrieve the strong reference from the weak reference when needed. This will ensure that the original `self` object is not inadvertently garbage collected.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a weak reference to self
    weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    def engine():
        # Retrieve the strong reference from the weak reference
        period = weak_period()
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    return engine
```

By wrapping the creation of the engine object inside a closure function and storing the weak reference `weak_period` within that closure, we ensure that the reference to `self` remains alive as long as it is needed by the `_engine` function.

This corrected version of the `_engine` function should now properly handle the weak reference to `self` and prevent the original object from being garbage collected prematurely. This fix should allow the failing test case to pass successfully.
