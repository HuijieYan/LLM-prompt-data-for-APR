### Bug in the original function:
The bug in the `_engine` function lies in the way `weakref.ref(self)` is used. The `weakref.ref()` function returns a weak reference object for the given object without keeping a strong reference to it. This means that the weak reference object will not prevent the given object from being garbage collected.

In the original `_engine` function, the weak reference object `period` is stored in a local variable and then passed to `_engine_type`. However, since `period` is just a weak reference, it may get garbage collected before being used by `_engine_type`, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

### Fix strategy:
To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is kept alive until it is used in `_engine_type`. One way to achieve this is by storing the weak reference object as an attribute of `self`. By doing this, the weak reference will be associated with the `PeriodIndex` instance itself, keeping it alive as long as the instance is active.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference as an instance attribute to prevent it from being garbage collected
    self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```
