### Cause of the bug
The bug in the `_engine` function lies in the way a weak reference to `self` is being passed to `_engine_type`. The current implementation is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference, but this creates an additional wrapper around the object which causes issues when used directly in the `_engine_type`.

### How to fix the bug
To fix the bug, we should pass `self` directly to `_engine_type` without creating a weak reference.

### Corrected version of the `_engine` function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
