The bug in the `_engine` function is related to the usage of `weakref.ref()` in an incorrect way that is causing `WeakMethod` object has no attribute '_engine_type' error. The issue lies in passing a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type` method.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the way we are passing the weak reference of `self`. We should use the weak reference object to retrieve the original object before calling `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    period = period_weakref()
    return period._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```

This modification ensures that the weak reference `period` is used to retrieve the original `self` object before calling `_engine_type`. This should fix the bug and the function should now work correctly without causing the AttributeError.
