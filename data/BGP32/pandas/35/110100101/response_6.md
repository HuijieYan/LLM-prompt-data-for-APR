### Analysis
- The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to the `self` object.
- The purpose of this `_engine` function is to return an instance of `_engine_type` by passing the weak reference `period` and the length of `self`.
- However, the use of `weakref.ref` here may lead to the weak reference getting garbage collected before it is used in the `_engine_type` call.
- This could result in unexpected behavior or errors during the creation of the `_engine` instance.
- To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` remains alive during the creation of `_engine_type`.

### Bug Cause
The bug in the `PeriodIndex._engine` function arises from the weak reference `period` being created and returned without being retained. This can lead to `period` being garbage collected before it is used to create the `_engine` instance, causing unexpected behavior or errors.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` remains alive while creating the `_engine` instance. We can update the function to store the weak reference within the `self` object to prevent it from being garbage collected prematurely.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference within a class attribute to retain it
    self._period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference in the `PeriodIndex` instance itself, we ensure that the reference remains alive as long as the `PeriodIndex` object exists. This prevents premature garbage collection and ensures correct behavior of the `_engine` function.
