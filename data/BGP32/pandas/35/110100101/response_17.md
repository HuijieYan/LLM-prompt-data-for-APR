The buggy function `_engine` is attempting to create a weak reference to the `self` object and pass it to the `_engine_type` constructor. However, the weak reference is not being correctly created, leading to potential reference cycle issues.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the weak reference is properly created. Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use weakref.ref with callable to avoid creating a reference cycle
    period = weakref.ref(self, lambda wref_self: None)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In this corrected version, we pass a callable `lambda wref_self: None` as the second argument to `weakref.ref` to ensure that the weak reference does not keep a reference to `self`. This should resolve the reference cycle issue and fix the bug.

After applying this fix, the function should pass the failing test case provided.
