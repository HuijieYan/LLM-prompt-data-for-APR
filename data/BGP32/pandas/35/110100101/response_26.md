### Analysis
The issue in the `_engine` function lies in the way it is creating a weak reference to `self`. The `weakref.ref` function is used incorrectly here. It should create a weak reference to `self`, but the resulting weak reference object is not being dereferenced correctly when passed to `_engine_type`. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially reference cycle problems.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref`. The weak reference should be dereferenced with `()` in order to get the actual object reference.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Correctly create the weak reference to `self`.
2. Dereference the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Code
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By making these changes, the weak reference `period` will correctly reference `self` in a way that avoids reference cycle issues.
