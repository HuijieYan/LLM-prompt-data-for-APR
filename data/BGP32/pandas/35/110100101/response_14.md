The bug in the `_engine` function is that it is creating a weak reference to `self` but not dereferencing it when passing to `_engine_type`. This can lead to `self` being garbage collected before being used in `_engine_type`, causing unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, we should dereference the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` instead of just `period`, we dereference the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`, ensuring that `self` is retained until after the `_engine_type` call.

This correction ensures that the function correctly creates an instance of `self._engine_type` using the weakly referenced `self` as intended, avoiding any potential reference cycle issues.
