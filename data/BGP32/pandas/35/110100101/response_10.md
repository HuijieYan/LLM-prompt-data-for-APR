### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self` and then passing it to `_engine_type`. However, it is not correctly passing the weak reference object, which is causing the bug.

### Bug Explanation
The bug arises because `weakref.ref` creates a weak reference object, but simply passing this object to `_engine_type` as the first argument is incorrect. Instead, the correct way to use `weakref.ref` is to call it to get the actual object being referenced.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to call the `weakref.ref` object to get the actual referenced object before passing it to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By calling `weakref.ref(self)()`, we are actually getting the referenced object rather than the weak reference object itself. This corrected version should fix the bug.
