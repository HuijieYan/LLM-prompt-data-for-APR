## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is intended to return an instance of `_engine_type` with a weak reference to `self` passed as an argument.
2. The issue is related to copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`, where the weak references are lost, causing `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.
3. The bug is likely due to the weak reference not being handled correctly, leading to a reference cycle issue.
4. The bug can be fixed by properly managing the weak reference passed to `_engine_type`.
5. The corrected version of the function should ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained and used appropriately.

## Bug Fix
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    
    # Ensure that the weak reference is properly handled
    def engine_factory():
        period = period_ref()
        if period is None:
            raise RuntimeError("Weak reference to PeriodIndex object is None")
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    return engine_factory
```

By implementing the above bug fix, the function now properly handles the weak reference to `self` and creates a closure `engine_factory` function that can safely access the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object when needed. This approach addresses the issue of losing weak references during the copying of `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`.
