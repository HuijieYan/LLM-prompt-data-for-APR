## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class uses a `weakref` to avoid a reference cycle and passes a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`.
2. The issue seems to occur because the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.
3. The failing test is related to copying `PeriodIndex` levels on a `MultiIndex`, which results in losing weak references, leading to errors in checking monotonicity.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the premature loss of the weak reference to `self` in the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class. When the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before the intended usage, it results in passing a `None` to the `PeriodEngine`, causing unexpected behavior.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until it is used within the `_engine` method. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference in a variable within the `PeriodIndex` instance to prevent it from being prematurely released.

## Corrected Code
```python
# Updated _engine method to store the weak reference
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a weak reference of self to avoid premature release
    self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference within the `PeriodIndex` instance, the issue of losing the weak reference prematurely should be resolved, leading to the correct behavior when checking monotonicity in the provided test case.
