### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a cached readonly property within the `PeriodIndex` class.
2. The function creates a weak reference to the `self` instance of `PeriodIndex` and then returns the result of `_engine_type` called with the weak reference and the length of `self`.
3. The bug causes the weak reference `period` to lose its reference to `self`, leading to incorrect behavior in the subsequent `_engine_type` call.
4. The bug is related to weak referencing and caching the engine of the `PeriodIndex` instance.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the premature dropping of the weak reference `period` created to reference `self` within the `_engine` function. This results in passing None to the `_engine_type` constructor, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
Modify the `_engine` function to retain the weak reference `period` until it is used by the `_engine_type` constructor to prevent premature dropping and ensure correct referencing.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self), period)
```

This correction ensures that the weak reference `period` remains valid until it is utilized by the `_engine_type` constructor within the `PeriodIndex` class. This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug report related to weak referencing within the `PeriodIndex` levels on a `MultiIndex`.
