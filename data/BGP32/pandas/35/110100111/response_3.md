## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class returns the result of calling `_engine_type` with a weak reference to the `self` object. The intention is to avoid creating a reference cycle that could lead to memory leaks.
2. The bug appears to be related to the weak reference usage in the `_engine` function, where the weak reference might not be valid when passed to `_engine_type`.
3. The failing test case initializes a `MultiIndex` with a `PeriodIndex` as one of the levels. The test checks if the levels in the transformed `MultiIndex` are monotonic, but due to the buggy behavior in `PeriodIndex._engine`, the weak reference related problem occurs leading to the test failure.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` remains valid when passed to `_engine_type`.
5. We can achieve this by updating the `_engine` function to store the weak reference in a more persistent way, ensuring that it remains valid throughout the `_engine` method call.

## Bug Fix
```python
import weakref
from pandas.util._decorators import Appender, cache_readonly, doc

# Corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a persistent reference to self as a weak reference
    self._period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference to `self` within the instance (`self._period`), we ensure that the reference remains valid during the `_engine` method call. This should resolve the weak reference related issue and allow the test to pass successfully.
