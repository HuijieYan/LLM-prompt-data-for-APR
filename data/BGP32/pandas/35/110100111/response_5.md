## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, but it is not being used correctly within the `_engine_type` call.
2. The issue is related to a weak reference being dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the weak reference `period` created by `weakref.ref(self)` is not used properly within the `_engine_type` call, resulting in a weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped prematurely.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` remains alive during the call to `_engine_type`. This can be achieved by modifying how the weak reference is used within the `_engine` function.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

By changing `period` to `period()` in the function, we ensure that the weak reference is dereferenced before being passed to `_engine_type`, which should resolve the premature dropping of the weak reference.
