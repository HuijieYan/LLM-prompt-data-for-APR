The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is causing an issue due to weak referencing. The problem arises from the `_engine` function attempting to weakly reference `self` but not maintaining a strong reference to the weak reference object.

### Error Location:
The issue lies in the line:
```python
period = weakref.ref(self)
```
Here, `period` should hold a reference to `self` using `weakref.proxy` rather than `weakref.ref` to maintain a strong reference.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug leads to the `self` object being prematurely garbage collected due to the weak reference not being held strongly, resulting in `_engine_type` receiving `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
Adjust the line where the weak reference is created to use `weakref.proxy` to prevent early garbage collection of `self`.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected code for the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use weakref.proxy instead of weakref.ref to maintain a strong reference
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By making this adjustment, the weak reference to `self` will be maintained correctly, preventing premature garbage collection and resolving the bug. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
