## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` incorrectly. The purpose of using a weak reference is to avoid circular references, but in this case, it is being passed to `_engine_type` without converting back to a strong reference when needed. This results in `period` being a weak reference when it should be a strong reference.

## Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is that the `period` being passed to `_engine_type` is a weak reference instead of a strong reference. This leads to `None` being passed to `_engine_type`, causing unexpected behavior.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to convert the weak reference back to a strong reference before passing it to `_engine_type`. This can be done by using `period()` to retrieve the original object from the weak reference.

## The Corrected Version
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By using `period()` to retrieve the original object from the weak reference `period`, we ensure that a strong reference is passed to `_engine_type`, fixing the bug.
