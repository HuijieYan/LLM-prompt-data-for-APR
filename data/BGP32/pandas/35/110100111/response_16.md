### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is intended to return an instance of `_engine_type` by passing a weak reference of `self`. However, the weak reference `period` is not maintained properly, leading to a reference cycle issue.
2. The weak reference to `self` should be stored in a stronger reference variable to ensure it is not prematurely garbage-collected.
3. The bug causes the `_engine_type` to receive a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex` instance, resulting in unexpected behavior and errors during execution.
4. To fix this bug, we should store the weak reference `period` in a class attribute to maintain its validity as long as the `PeriodIndex` instance is alive.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    # Existing code...

    # Fix the buggy function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Store the weak reference in a class attribute
        self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference of `self` in a class attribute `_period_ref`, we ensure that the reference is not lost during the execution of `_engine`. This change resolves the issue of reference cycle and ensures that the `PeriodIndex` instance is correctly passed to the `_engine_type`.
