## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` instance. It is passing this weak reference to `_engine_type` constructor along with `len(self)` which represents the length of `self`.
2. The issue mentioned on GitHub indicates that when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`, weakrefs are being lost.
3. The cause of the bug seems to be related to the fact that the weak reference to `self` is getting lost before intended, leading to `_engine_type` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained throughout the lifetime of the instance, allowing `_engine_type` to use the weak reference properly.

## Proposed Fix:
To address the bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to use `functools.partial` to create a weakly bound method to the `_engine_type` constructor, ensuring that the weak reference to `self` persists when `_engine_type` is called.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class:

```python
from functools import partial

...
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        return partial(self._engine_type, weakref.ref(self), len(self))
...
```

This modification should maintain the weak reference to `self` correctly and allow the `PeriodEngine` to access the `PeriodIndex` instance as intended.
