## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class creates a weak reference to `self` and then passes this weak reference to the `_engine_type` function. The issue arises from the fact that the weak reference `period` loses its reference too early, leading to `None` being passed to `_engine_type` instead of the actual `self` reference.

## Error Location
The bug is within the `_engine` function where `period` is defined and passed to `_engine_type`.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by prematurely losing the weak reference `period` inside the `_engine` function. This results in passing `None` to `_engine_type`, breaking the expected functionality.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the weak reference `period` remains valid until `_engine_type` is called. One way to achieve this is by keeping a reference to the weak reference until it gets used. This way, the weakly referenced object won't get garbage collected before its intended use.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function _engine
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weak_period, len(self))
```

By creating a new variable `weak_period` to hold the weak reference, we ensure that the weak reference remains valid until it is used in `_engine_type`. This corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
