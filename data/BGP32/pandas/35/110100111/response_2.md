## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class seems to be creating a weak reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`.
2. The bug is likely related to weak referencing not maintaining the actual reference to `self` leading to `None` being passed to `_engine_type`.
3. The test case `test_get_level_values_when_periods` expects the result of `is_monotonic` to be `True` for all levels in `idx2`, which is not being met due to the weak referencing issue.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained properly within the `_engine` function.

## Bug Cause
The bug is occurring because the weak reference to `self` is not being correctly maintained within the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. This results in `None` being passed to `_engine_type`, causing unexpected behavior.

## Fix Strategy
We need to modify the `_engine` function to correctly maintain the weak reference to `self` throughout its usage. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference as an instance variable within the `PeriodIndex` class, ensuring that it remains valid until the function execution is complete.

## Corrected Version
```python
import weakref

class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    def __init__(self, data=None, copy=False, freq=None, year=None, month=None, quarter=None, day=None,
                 hour=None, minute=None, second=None, tz=None, dtype=None):
        # Existing __init__ implementation

    @property
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        if not hasattr(self, '_period_ref'):
            self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference `self._period_ref` as an instance variable within the `PeriodIndex` class, we ensure that it remains valid throughout the `_engine` function execution. This should resolve the issue and pass the failing test case.
