## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class returns an instance of `_engine_type` by passing a weak reference of `self` as `period`.
2. The issue reported on GitHub states that copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` loses weakrefs, causing the `_engine` function to receive `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex` instance.
3. The problematic part seems to be the weak reference usage in the `_engine` function, leading to the loss of reference.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly maintained.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class to manage the weak reference of `self` properly to prevent losing the reference.
2. Ensure that the weak reference to `self` is passed correctly to `_engine_type`.

## Bug-fixed code:
```python
import weakref

class PeriodIndex:
    """
    Immutable ndarray holding ordinal values indicating regular periods in time.
    Index keys are boxed to Period objects which carries the metadata (eg, frequency information).
    """

    def _engine(self):
        period = weakref.proxy(self)  # Use weakref.proxy to maintain weak reference
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, we ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained correctly, thereby fixing the bug reported on GitHub.
