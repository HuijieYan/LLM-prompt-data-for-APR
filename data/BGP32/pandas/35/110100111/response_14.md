## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self` and pass it to `_engine_type`.
2. The issue is related to weak references being dropped prematurely, resulting in `None` being passed instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.
3. The failing test involves copying `MultiIndex` levels from a `PeriodIndex` which leads to weak references being lost.
4. The strategy for fixing the bug involves ensuring that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until it is no longer needed.

## Bug Fix
```python
    # Fix for the _engine function to maintain weak reference
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        weak_ref_keeper = (lambda x: x)(period)  # Keeping the weak reference until _engine_type is called
        return self._engine_type(weak_ref_keeper, len(self))
```

By utilizing a lambda function, the weak reference to `self` is kept until it is used within `_engine_type`. This approach ensures that the weak reference does not get dropped prematurely, resolving the issue with weak references being lost in the `PeriodIndex` class.
