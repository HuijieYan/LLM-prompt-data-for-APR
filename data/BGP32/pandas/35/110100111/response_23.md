## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is intended to return an instance of `_engine_type` with a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object.
2. The bug seems to be related to not properly creating the weak reference, leading to the `period` variable being lost, and None being passed to `_engine_type`.
3. The issue in GitHub highlights that copying the levels of `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` results in the weak reference being lost, causing errors.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is properly maintained throughout the function.

## Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of the weak reference in the `_engine` function. The weak reference object `period` is not correctly retained, leading to it being garbage collected before it is used. This results in passing `None` to `_engine_type`, causing unexpected behavior.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to store the weak reference object `period` in a persistent variable within the `_engine` function so that it is not lost. Proper handling of weak references will ensure that the `PeriodIndex` object remains available when creating the engine instance.

## Corrected Code
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    self_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self_ref, len(self))
``` 

By ensuring that a persistent reference `self_ref` is maintained within the function, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object will not be lost prematurely, resolving the bug.
