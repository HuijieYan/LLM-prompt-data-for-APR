## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class is intended to return an instance of `_engine_type` with a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object to avoid reference cycles.
2. The main issue seems to be how the weak reference is being created and passed to `_engine_type`.
3. The failing test is related to a problem where weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` objects are being dropped prematurely, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_engine` function arises from the incorrect creation and handling of the weak reference. The `weakref.ref` call should be used to create a weak reference object, not just assign a weak reference to the `period` variable. This causes the weak reference to not be properly stored, resulting in `weakref.ref` not functioning as intended when passed to `_engine_type`.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the weak reference should be correctly created using `weakref.ref(self)` to properly maintain the reference to the `PeriodIndex` object. This will ensure that the weak reference is maintained and utilized correctly in the `_engine_type` constructor.

## The corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Correctly create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```

By correcting the weak reference creation, the updated `_engine` function should now properly maintain the reference to the `PeriodIndex` object, resolving the issue identified in the failing test.
