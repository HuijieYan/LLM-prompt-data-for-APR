### Analysis:
1. The `PeriodIndex` class has a `_engine` function that returns an `_engine_type` instance using a weak reference of `self`. This `_engine_type` instance is constructed with the weak reference and the length of the `PeriodIndex`.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` involves creating a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` and then copying the levels of the `MultiIndex` using `_get_level_values`. This scenario involves the weak reference losing its reference to the `PeriodIndex`.
3. The bug occurs because the weak reference is being lost or dropping before it is intended, leading to the `_engine_type` instance receiving `None` instead of a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex`.
4. To fix the bug, the weak reference handling in the `_engine` function should be revised to ensure that the reference to `self` remains valid during the construction of the `_engine_type` instance.

### Bug Fix:
Here is a corrected version of the `_engine` function that addresses the issue:
```python
def _engine(self):
    # Maintain a strong reference to self within the lambda to ensure the weak reference stays alive
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(lambda: period(), len(self))
```

In this corrected version, a lambda function is used within the `weakref.ref` call to retain a strong reference to `self`. This ensures that the weak reference will not be lost prematurely and that the `_engine_type` instance receives the intended reference to the `PeriodIndex`.

With this fix, the bug causing the weak reference to drop prematurely should be resolved, and the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` should pass successfully.
