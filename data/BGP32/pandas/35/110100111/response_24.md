## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is intended to return an instance of `_engine_type` by passing a weak reference of the `self` object to it.
2. The issue arises from not correctly passing the weak reference to `_engine_type`, resulting in a `None` being passed instead of the `PeriodIndex`.
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods()` creates a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex`, where the `PeriodIndex` object loses its weak reference during the process, leading to incorrect behavior.
4. To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the weak reference to the `self` object is correctly passed to the `_engine_type`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the `_engine` function to create a weak reference to the `self` object.
2. Ensure that the weak reference is correctly passed as an argument when creating the `_engine_type` instance.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# Fixing the buggy function _engine
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Pass the weak reference to _engine_type
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By using `period()` instead of just `period`, we ensure that the weak reference is properly dereferenced to obtain the `self` object when creating the `_engine_type` instance.

This correction should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and pass the failing test case.
