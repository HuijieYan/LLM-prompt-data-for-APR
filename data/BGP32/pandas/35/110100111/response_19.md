## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a cache_readonly function that returns an instance of some `_engine_type` class.
2. The buggy function attempts to create a weak reference to `self` as `period`, but the weak reference usage seems incorrect.
3. The failing test involves creating a MultiIndex that uses `_get_level_values` method, which indirectly uses the `_engine` method, leading to an issue with weak references being dropped prematurely.
4. To fix the bug, the weak reference creation needs to be adjusted to correctly maintain the reference to `self`.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of weak references in the `_engine` function. The weak reference is not properly maintained leading to the PeriodEngine receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

## Fix Strategy
Adjust the weak reference creation to ensure that `self` is correctly referenced and avoid premature dropping of the weak reference.

## Corrected Code
```python
# The buggy function you need to fix
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Correct the weak reference creation by directly referencing self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    if period() is None:  # Safeguard against prematurely dropped weak reference
        period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
