## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref` to pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`, but the implementation is not correct. This issue is causing the failing test in the `test_get_level_values_when_periods` function.

The failing test is checking if all level values in the `MultiIndex` object created from a `PeriodIndex` object are monotonic. The bug in `_engine` causes weak referencing to fail, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_engine` function is due to the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref`. In the current implementation:
1. The `period` variable is created as a weak reference to `self`.
2. The weak reference `period` is passed to `_engine_type` along with `len(self)`.

The problem lies in `period = weakref.ref(self)`, which only creates a weak reference, but does not dereference it when passing to `_engine_type`. This results in `_engine_type` receiving the weak reference wrapper instead of the actual `PeriodIndex` object.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `period` weak reference should be dereferenced before passing it to `_engine_type`. This ensures that `_engine_type` receives the actual `PeriodIndex` object instead of a weak reference.

## Corrected Version
```python
# Assume the necessary imports are available

class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    # Existing class definition here

    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Dereference the weak reference before passing
        period = self  # Dereference
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

After applying this corrected version, the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` should pass successfully.
