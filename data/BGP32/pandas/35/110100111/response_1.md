To fix the bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class, we need to modify the implementation to correctly handle the weak reference to the instance of `PeriodIndex` to avoid a reference cycle.

### Error Location:
The issue lies in the method `_engine` of the `PeriodIndex` class. The `weakref.ref` function is used incorrectly, leading to a weak reference not being maintained properly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is causing the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance to be dropped prematurely, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` getting `None` instead of the correct `PeriodIndex`.

### Fix Strategy:
In the corrected version, we need to correctly maintain the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance by ensuring that the weak reference object is stored as an attribute of the class. This way, the reference cycle will be avoided, allowing the `PeriodEngine` to reference the `PeriodIndex` instance correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store weak reference to self as an attribute
    if not hasattr(self, '_period_weakref'):
        self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference to `self` in the `_period_weakref` attribute of the class, we ensure that the reference is maintained throughout the execution, preventing premature dropping of the weak reference.

This updated implementation should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance is correctly handled by the `PeriodEngine`.
