The bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class is due to the weak reference not being properly handled, leading to a `None` being passed to the `PeriodEngine`. To fix this bug, we need to ensure the weak reference is kept alive throughout the function's execution.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    def engine_constructor():
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    return engine_constructor()
```

In this corrected version, we maintain a closure `engine_constructor` that is returned from the `_engine` function. This closure ensures that the weak reference `period` remains alive until it's needed by the `self._engine_type` call.

This fix should resolve the issue described in the GitHub bug report and ensure that the function works correctly without losing weakrefs.
