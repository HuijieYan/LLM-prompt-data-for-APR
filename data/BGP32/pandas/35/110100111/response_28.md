## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using a weak reference to avoid reference cycles, but there is a bug causing the weak reference to be lost.
2. The bug is likely in the way the weak reference is being created and passed to `_engine_type`.
3. The failing test is checking the monotonic property of the levels after creating a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex`. The bug is causing the weak reference of the `PeriodIndex` to be dropped before intended.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained throughout the `_engine` function execution.
5. We need to modify the `_engine` function to correctly use the weak reference.

## Bug Fix
```python
# Updated corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    # Define a lambda function to capture the weak reference
    get_period_weakref = lambda: period

    # Pass the lambda function to _engine_type
    return self._engine_type(get_period_weakref, len(self))
```

By capturing the `period` weak reference in a lambda function (`get_period_weakref`) and passing this lambda function to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained throughout the execution of the `_engine` function. This should resolve the bug and allow the `MultiIndex` test to pass successfully.
