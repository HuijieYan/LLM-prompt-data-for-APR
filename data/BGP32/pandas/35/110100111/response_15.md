## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`. However, the weak reference is not being properly maintained, leading to potential issues when accessing `self` later. The function is returning an object of type `_engine_type` created using the weak reference, but there might be issues due to the weak reference handling.

## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_engine` function is related to how the `weakref` is used to create a reference to `self` and pass it to `_engine_type`. If there is a reference cycle, the weak reference might be deleted before it's intended to, resulting in the `_engine` function returning incorrect/None values.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` remains valid throughout the usage in `_engine` function. One approach could be storing the weak reference in an instance variable to keep it alive as long as the PeriodIndex instance exists.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# Fix the buggy function _engine to properly maintain the weak reference

def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference as an instance variable to keep it alive
    self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

## Updated Class Definition
You need to include the corrected `_engine` function above in the `PeriodIndex` class definition. This change should address the weak reference issue and ensure that the function works correctly with the expected input/output values and resolves the GitHub issue.
