## Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The function creates a weak reference `period` to `self` and then attempts to pass this weak reference to the `_engine_type` constructor. However, the weak reference `period` is not being correctly stored, resulting in `None` being passed to `_engine_type`.

## Bug Explanation
The `_engine` function attempts to create a weak reference to `self` using the `weakref.ref` function but mistakenly assigns the weak reference to a local variable `period`. This local variable does not persist beyond the `_engine` function, causing the weak reference to become invalid. As a result, when `_engine_type` is called with `period` as an argument, it actually receives `None` instead of a valid weak reference to `self`, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the weak reference should be stored as an attribute of the `self` object rather than as a local variable within the `_engine` function. By storing the weak reference as an attribute, it will persist as long as the `self` object exists, ensuring that it remains valid when passed to `_engine_type`.

## The corrected function
```python
    # this is the corrected function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Store a weakref to self as an attribute to maintain reference
        self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
``` 

By making this change, the weak reference to `self` will remain valid throughout the lifespan of the `PeriodIndex` object, ensuring that the `_engine_type` constructor receives the expected weak reference when creating the engine. This correction should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
