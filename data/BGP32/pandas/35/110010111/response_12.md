## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using the `weakref` module to create a weak reference to `self`, which is a `PeriodIndex` instance. The purpose is to avoid reference cycles.
2. The function returns an object created by `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, where `self._engine_type` expects a `period` object and an integer as inputs.
3. The error message indicates an attribute error during attribute access, suggesting that the value being accessed is None. This points to a problem in creating the weak reference or utilizing it.
4. The GitHub issue relates to weak referencing in a `MultiIndex` context, which involves copying levels and losing weak reference. The test case provided reflects this issue.

## Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly created and used to avoid losing the reference.
2. Verify that the `PeriodIndex` instance is accessible through the weak reference when creating the `_engine` object.
3. Test the fixed function with the provided failing test for `MultiIndex` levels.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period_ref(), len(self))
```  

The fix includes creating a `period_ref` from the weak reference instead of directly using `self`. This should maintain the reference to `self` during the `_engine` object creation without running into the attribute error issue.
