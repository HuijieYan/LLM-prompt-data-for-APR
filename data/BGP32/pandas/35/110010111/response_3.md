### Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function is a cacheable readonly property `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class. The purpose of this property is to create an instance of the `_engine_type` class with weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object. The cache mechanism ensures that the `_engine` property is only computed once and then stored for subsequent accesses.

The error message indicates that an `AttributeError` is raised during the execution of the test `test_get_level_values_when_periods`. Specifically, the issue seems to be related to the `_do_monotonic_check` method within the `_engine` class that expects the `_engine.is_monotonic_increasing` to be a valid object but receives `None`.

### Identifying potential error locations

The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. The weak reference creation `period = weakref.ref(self)` might not be working as intended.
2. The initialization of the `_engine_type` instance `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` could have a problem resulting in `None`.

### Explanation of the bug

The bug occurs due to the weak reference not being properly handled or the initialization of the `_engine_type` instance not storing the weak reference correctly. This leads to an `AttributeError` when the `view("i8")` method is called on a `None` object.


### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is correctly created and passed to `_engine_type` to avoid the weak reference being lost. Additionally, the `_engine_type` constructor should handle the weak reference properly to prevent `None` values.

### Bug-fix updated code:

```python
# Updated corrected code

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_instance = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine_instance

``` 

By following this approach, the corrected code ensures that the weak reference `period` is passed correctly to `_engine_type` during the initialization of the `_engine` instance. This should resolve the error and ensure that the weak reference is maintained as expected.
