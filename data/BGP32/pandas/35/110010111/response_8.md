### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is supposed to return an instance of `_engine_type` initialized with a weak reference of the `PeriodIndex` object and its length.
2. The error occurs in the `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))` line due to a reference cycle.
3. The error message shows that `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, indicating that the weak reference `period` is not correctly passed to `_engine_type`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is maintained throughout the `_engine` function execution.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference of `self` is stored and used correctly in the `_engine` function. We should also handle the case where the weak reference becomes garbage collected by checking if it is still alive before using it.

### Corrected Function:
```python
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        
        def _secured_period():
            p = period()
            if p is not None:  # Check if weak reference is alive
                return p
            else:
                raise RuntimeError("Weak reference not available.")
        
        return self._engine_type(_secured_period, len(self))
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the weak reference remains valid when used in `_engine_type`. It also handles the scenario if the weak reference becomes unavailable.
