### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a cached read-only property of the `PeriodIndex` class.
2. The error occurs when trying to access `self._engine.is_monotonic_increasing` from within another method, causing an AttributeError due to `self._engine` being set to None.
3. The expected input values include a `PeriodArray` named `self._values` and a `PeriodIndex` instance named `self`.
4. The bug is causing the `PeriodIndex` levels to lose weakrefs, leading to a `NoneType` error when accessing properties of the `PeriodEngine`.
5. To fix the bug, the `_engine` property should be modified to ensure that a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance is maintained correctly.

### Suggestions for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `_engine` property to correctly handle weak references in order to prevent reference cycles and maintain the `PeriodIndex` instance.
2. Ensure that the weak reference is kept alive during the `_engine` property's lifetime to avoid the `NoneType` error.
3. Implement a mechanism to properly return the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` instance when needed.

### Corrected Version of the `_engine` Function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    def _period_engine(_period, length):
        return PeriodEngine(_period, length)
    
    return _period_engine(period, len(self))
``` 

By modifying the `_engine` function in this way, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance `self` is maintained properly, preventing the AttributeError caused by losing the reference.
