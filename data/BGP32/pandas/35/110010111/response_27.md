## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class returns a value based on `self._engine_type`, passing a weak reference of `self` and the length of the index. The error message indicates an attribute error where a `NoneType` does not have the `view` attribute, suggesting that the engine is not being initialized correctly.

The expected input values involve a `PeriodArray` and a `PeriodIndex` instance containing period values. The buggy function is not correctly handling the weak reference `period` passed to `_engine_type`.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the weak reference `period` not being correctly handled when passed to `_engine_type`. This results in the engine being assigned as `None`, causing the attribute error during the test execution.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, ensure that the weak reference `period` is maintained properly when passed to `_engine_type`. Here, it involves resolving the issue related to weak references being dropped before intended, leading to a `NoneType` issue during engine initialization.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    if engine is None:
        return None
    else:
        return engine
``` 

In the corrected version, the weak reference `period` is passed to `_engine_type`, and then the return value is checked. If the engine is `None`, return `None`, otherwise return the engine. This fix ensures that the engine is correctly initialized and returned, avoiding the `NoneType` attribute error.
