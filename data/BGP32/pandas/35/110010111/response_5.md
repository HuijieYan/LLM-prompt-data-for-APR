### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine(self)` is a cached readonly property that returns an instance of `self._engine_type` by passing a weak reference of `self` to it. The purpose of using weak reference is to prevent reference cycles.

2. The error occurs when trying to access the `view` attribute on a `NoneType` object in the `_do_monotonic_check()` method while checking if the index is monotonic increasing.

3. Cause of the bug:
   - The weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object is being dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the actual `PeriodIndex`.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
   - Ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly maintained throughout the `_engine(self)` function to prevent premature dropping.

### Updated corrected function:
```python
    # Corrected version of the _engine function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
