### Analyzing the buggy function and the issue:

1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class seems to be causing issues related to weak references and the `PeriodEngine`.
2. The failing test is related to `MultiIndex` levels losing weakrefs when copied, leading to an error when checking monotonicity.
3. The expected input values include a `PeriodArray` object and a `PeriodIndex` object. The buggy function is meant to return a `PeriodEngine` object.
4. The bug seems to be related to the weak reference creation and handling within the `_engine` function.

### Bug Explanation:
When the `_engine` function is called with a weak reference to `self`, it is supposed to return an instance of `self._engine_type`. However, due to incorrect handling of weak references, the weak reference `period` is not being used effectively, leading to a `NoneType` error when attempting to access it.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is maintained correctly and utilized when creating the `PeriodEngine` instance. By addressing the weak reference handling, we can prevent the `NoneType` error and ensure that the `PeriodEngine` is properly initialized.

### Corrected Version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    period = period_ref()
    if period is None:
        raise ValueError("Weak reference to self is no longer available.")
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By incorporating the check for the weak reference validity, the corrected version of the `_engine` function should be able to handle the weak reference appropriately and avoid the `NoneType` error.
