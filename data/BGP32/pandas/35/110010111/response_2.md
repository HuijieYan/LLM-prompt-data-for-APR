### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is defined within the `PeriodIndex` class. It aims to avoid reference cycles by using `weakref.ref` for self and then calling `_engine_type` with the weak reference and the length of self.
2. The error occurs when trying to access the attribute `view` of a `NoneType` object, indicating an issue with the weak reference handling.
3. Cause of Bug:
   - The `_engine` function is not correctly handling the weak reference to self, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the expected PeriodIndex.
4. Suggested Fix:
   - Ensure that the weak reference to self is maintained correctly throughout the `_engine` function to prevent it from being garbage collected prematurely.
   
### Corrected Version:
```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)  # Keep a weak reference to self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
