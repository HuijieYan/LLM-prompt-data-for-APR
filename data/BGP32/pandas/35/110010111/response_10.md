### Bug Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is intended to return an instance of `PeriodEngine` by passing a weak reference of self and the length of self to `_engine_type`.
2. The error occurs in the test case `test_get_level_values_when_periods` due to a weak reference issue with `PeriodEngine`, resulting in `NoneType` error in the `_do_monotonic_check` method.
3. The expected behavior is for the `_engine` function to correctly generate a `PeriodEngine` instance with the proper weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To resolve the weak reference issue and prevent the `NoneType` error, the `_engine` function needs to correctly utilize the weak reference of self when passing it to `_engine_type`. Ensuring that the weak reference does not get lost prematurely will fix the bug.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By invoking `period()` when passing the weak reference, we extract the referenced object to retain a valid reference during the creation of the `PeriodEngine` instance. This change should resolve the weakly referenced `NoneType` error.
