## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is intended to return an instance of `self._engine_type` with a weak reference to `self`.
2. The error occurs when trying to access an attribute of `self._engine_type` that results in a `NoneType` object, causing an `AttributeError`.
3. The failing test involves creating a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` and checking if the levels are monotonic, which fails due to the bug in the `_engine` function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained correctly and does not result in a `NoneType` object when accessing attributes of `self._engine_type`.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_engine` function is due to the weak reference not being handled properly, resulting in a `NoneType` object causing an `AttributeError`. This leads to incorrect behavior when trying to access properties of `self._engine_type`.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly passed to `self._engine_type` to avoid the `NoneType` object issue.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))  # Corrected weak reference usage
```

By updating the weak reference usage to `period()` when passing it to `self._engine_type`, we ensure that the weak reference is correctly handled and doesn't result in a `NoneType` object.

This fix should address the bug and allow the function to work correctly with the expected input/output values, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
