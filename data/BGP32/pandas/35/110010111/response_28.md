### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class is utilizing a weak reference to avoid reference cycles, but it seems there is an issue with creating the weak reference and returning the engine using that weak reference.
2. The error message indicates that an `AttributeError` is raised because a `NoneType` object does not have the attribute `view`.

### Bug Cause:
- The `PeriodEngine` is unable to properly access the weakly-referenced `Period` object due to incorrect handling in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly created and passed to `_engine_type`.
- Verify that the creation and handling of weak references are correctly implemented to avoid the issue seen in the failing test.

### Corrected Function:
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Properly create a weak reference to self
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        # Check if the weak reference is not None before calling _engine_type
        if period is not None:
            return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
        else:
            # Handle the case where weak reference is None
            return None
```

By implementing the corrected function as shown above, the bug should be fixed, and the failing test should pass successfully.
