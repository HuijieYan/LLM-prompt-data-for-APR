### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is defined with a `@cache_readonly` decorator.
2. The function is intended to return an instance of `_engine_type` with `self` weakly referenced using `weakref.ref`.
3. The error message indicates that an `AttributeError` is raised because a `NoneType` object is encountered while trying to access an attribute `view`.
4. The expected values and types of the function's parameters are provided.

### Error Cause:
The `AttributeError` occurs because the weak reference to `self` in the `_engine` function seems to be losing its reference, resulting in the `_engine_type` being constructed with a `NoneType` object instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained correctly throughout the `_engine` function. This can be achieved by properly storing the weak reference to `self` in a local variable that remains in scope during the return of `_engine`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

Ensure that the reference to `self` remains valid until after the return of `_engine`.

This corrected version should resolve the `AttributeError` issue encountered in the failing test.
