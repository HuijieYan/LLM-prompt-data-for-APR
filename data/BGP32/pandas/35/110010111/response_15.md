## Analyzing the buggy function

1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` decorated method within the `PeriodIndex` class. The purpose of this function is to return an instance of `self._engine_type` using a weak reference of the `self` object.

2. The error message indicates an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` when trying to access the `view` attribute on a `NoneType` object.

3. Expected input values:
   - `self._values` should contain `PeriodArray` with values `['2019Q1', '2019Q2']`.
   - `self` should be a `PeriodIndex` object with values `['2019Q1', '2019Q2']`.

## Error Cause

The error is occurring because the weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` is not being handled correctly, leading to the `self` being destroyed before being passed to `_engine_type`.

## Fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is maintained until it is used to create the `self._engine_type` instance. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference locally within the `_engine` function to keep a strong reference to it during the entire function execution.

## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
# The corrected version of the `_engine` function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weakref to avoid reference cycle issue
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    result = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return result
```

By storing the weak reference `period` in a local variable inside the `_engine` function, we ensure that the reference is not lost prematurely. This corrected version should resolve the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
