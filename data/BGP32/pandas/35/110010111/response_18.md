## Analysis
The `PeriodIndex` class contains a `_engine` method that is intended to return an instance of `PeriodEngine` initialized with a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance. The bug occurs when calling methods like `is_monotonic` on a `MultiIndex` containing `PeriodIndex` levels. This triggers the `_engine` method, but due to a reference cycle issue, it results in a `NoneType` object being passed to `PeriodEngine`, leading to an `AttributeError`.

## Error Location
The error is likely occurring in the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class where a weak reference to `self` is being created. The weak reference might not be preserved correctly, leading to the issue.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is related to the weak reference handling in the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class. When the weak reference is not properly maintained or used, it results in the engine receiving a `NoneType` object instead of the `PeriodIndex` instance, causing the `AttributeError`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly set up and preserved throughout the lifecycle of the `PeriodIndex` instance. This can be achieved by modifying the `_engine` method to handle weak references properly.

## Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` method in the `PeriodIndex` class:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    weak_period = period if isinstance(period, weakref.ReferenceType) else weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weak_period, len(self))
```

By modifying the `_engine` method to explicitly check if `period` is an instance of `weakref.ReferenceType` and assigning the weak reference accordingly, we ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained correctly.

This fix should address the issue of passing a `NoneType` object to the `PeriodEngine` and resolve the `AttributeError` encountered during the failing test.
