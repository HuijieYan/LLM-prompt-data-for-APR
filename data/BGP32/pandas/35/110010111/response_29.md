### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is supposed to return an instance of `self._engine_type`, which takes a weak reference to `self` as the first argument (`period`) and the length of `self` as the second argument.
2. The error message indicates that an `AttributeError` occurred while trying to access the `view` attribute on a `NoneType` object in the `return super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter().view("i8")` line. This points to an issue with the `PeriodEngine` instance being `None`.
3. The cause of the bug is likely related to how weak references are handled or accessed in the `_engine` function, leading to the creation of a `None` object instead of a valid `PeriodEngine` instance.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly maintained and used to create a valid `PeriodEngine` instance.

### Bug Fix:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        engine = PeriodEngine(period, len(self))  # Create a new PeriodEngine if None
    return engine
``` 

This fix checks if the `self._engine_type` call returns `None` and creates a new `PeriodEngine` instance if needed. By ensuring that a valid `PeriodEngine` is returned, the AttributeError issue should be resolved.
