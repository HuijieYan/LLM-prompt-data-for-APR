### Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the class
- The buggy function `_engine` is a `@cache_readonly` method within the `PeriodIndex` class.
- It returns an instance of the `_engine_type` class by passing a weak reference of `self` and the length of `self`.

### Potential error locations within the buggy function
- The main potential error location is in how the weak reference to `self` is handled within the `_engine` function. If the weak reference is not properly managed, it can lead to `NoneType` object errors.

### Cause of the bug
- The cause of the bug is that the weak reference to `self` is not correctly handled within the `_engine` function. This leads to the `_engine_type` receiving a `NoneType` object instead of the intended `PeriodIndex` instance.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
- Ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly maintained within the `_engine` function to prevent it from becoming a `NoneType` object.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref(), len(self))
```

By updating the function to maintain the weak reference through `period_ref()`, we ensure that the `_engine_type` receives the actual `self` instance instead of a `NoneType` object, resolving the bug.
