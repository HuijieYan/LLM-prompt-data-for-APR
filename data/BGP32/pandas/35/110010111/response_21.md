### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` creates a weak reference to `self` and passes it to `_engine_type` to avoid reference cycles.
2. The error message indicates an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, suggesting that the `_engine` function is returning `None`, leading to the issue.
3. The expected input values for `self._values` and `self` are not directly reflected in the error message but are essential for the correct execution of `_engine`.
4. Based on the GitHub issue, the weak reference to `self` is not being maintained as long as intended, causing the engine to receive `None`.
5. To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should return the result of `_engine_type` with the correct weak reference to avoid the issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `_engine` function to correctly maintain the weak reference to `self`.
2. Ensure that the weak reference `period` correctly references `self` inside the `_engine` function.
3. Verify that the correct engine type is returned with the valid weak reference.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))  # Corrected weakref usage
``` 

By making the above correction, the weak reference to `self` will be correctly maintained, and the issue with receiving `NoneType` should be resolved.
