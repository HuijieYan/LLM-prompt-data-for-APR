## Analysis
- The buggy function `_engine` is a `@cache_readonly` method in the `PeriodIndex` class.
- It is trying to create a weak reference to the `self` object and pass it to `_engine_type` to create an engine instance.
- The error occurs when trying to access the weak reference value in the `PeriodEngine`.
- The expected behavior is for the weak reference to the `self` object to be maintained throughout the operation.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the anonymous weak reference `period` not being stored as an instance attribute of the `self` object, causing it to be garbage collected before being accessed in the `PeriodEngine`.

## Strategy for Fixing
To fix this bug, we need to store the weak reference `period` as an instance attribute of `self` so that it remains alive as long as `self` is alive.

## Code Fix
```python
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Store the weak reference as an instance attribute of self
        self._weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(self._weak_period, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference as `self._weak_period`, we ensure that the weak reference remains alive as long as the `PeriodIndex` instance exists. This change should address the bug and resolve the error message.
