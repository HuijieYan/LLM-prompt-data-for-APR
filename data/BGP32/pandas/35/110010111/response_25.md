### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in `PeriodIndex` class is supposed to create an instance of `PeriodEngine` with a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance.
2. The error occurs when trying to access an attribute (`view`) on a `NoneType` object in the `PeriodEngine` instance.
3. The cause of the bug is likely related to the weak reference handling where the reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance might not be maintained correctly leading to a `NoneType` object.
4. The bug can be fixed by ensuring that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance is correctly stored and accessed when creating the `PeriodEngine`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. We need to properly store the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance.
2. Retrieve the strong reference from the weak reference when creating the `PeriodEngine`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we create a strong reference by calling `period()` when passing the reference as an argument to `_engine_type`. This ensures that the `PeriodEngine` receives a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance.
