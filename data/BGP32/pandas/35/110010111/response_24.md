### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function Relationship:**
   - The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is responsible for creating an instance of the `_engine_type` class with a weak reference to the `self` object and its length.
   
2. **Error Location:**
   - The error seems to be occurring when trying to access the value of `vgetter()` in the `super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter().view("i8")` call in the `is_monotonic_increasing` method.
   
3. **Cause of the Bug:**
   - The bug is causing an `AttributeError` because the `_engine` function is not correctly creating the instance of `_engine_type`. This leads to the `self._engine` being `None`, resulting in the error during the subsequent calls.
   - The weak reference creation in the `_engine` function is not working as intended, leading to the `_engine` being `None`.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**
   - To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly maintained and utilized in creating the `_engine_type` instance.
   - We should modify how the weak reference is handled in the `_engine` function to prevent the reference cycle issue and ensure that a valid `_engine_type` instance is created. 

### Corrected Version:
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Use weakref to avoid reference cycle
        weak_self = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(weak_self, len(self))
```

By updating the `_engine` function to correctly create a weak reference to `self` and pass it to the `_engine_type` during instance creation, we can resolve the issue causing the `AttributeError`. The corrected version should now be able to pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
