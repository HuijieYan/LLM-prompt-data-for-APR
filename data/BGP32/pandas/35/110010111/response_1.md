### Steps to fix the bug:

1. Analyzing the buggy function: The `_engine` method in the `PeriodIndex` class is used to create an instance of the engine type with a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object. The bug seems to be related to the weak reference not being properly passed, leading to an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.
   
2. Error location: The issue seems to be in the way the weak reference `period` is assigned.

3. Cause of the bug: The buggy function fails to properly create a weak reference to the `self` object, leading to a `NoneType` error when trying to access an attribute later on. This causes an issue in the `_do_monotonic_check` method when trying to access the values of the `PeriodEngine`.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug: Ensure that the weak reference to the `self` object is correctly passed and utilized to avoid the reference cycle.

5. Corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```

This corrected version ensures that the weak reference `weakref.ref(self)` is passed to the `_engine_type` method, preventing reference cycle issues and resolving the `NoneType` error.
