## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class aims to return the `_engine_type` object with a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance.
2. The bug occurs when accessing the `is_monotonic` property of the `idx2.levels`, involving the `PeriodEngine` which expects a non-None value but receives None instead.
3. The cause of the bug lies in the weak reference handling within the `_engine` function, leading to the NoneType error during subsequent operations.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is correctly maintained and accessed within the `_engine` method, preventing it from becoming None unintentionally.

## Bug Fix
```python
# Updated and corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use a weak reference that holds the instance
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    # Get the engine type only if the weak reference to the instance still exists
    if period is not None:
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        raise ValueError("Weak reference to PeriodIndex instance is no longer valid")
```

By checking if the weak reference `period` is not None before using it to create the `_engine_type`, we ensure that the weak reference remains valid and prevents the NoneType error. This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub thread and ensures the correct behavior of the `_engine` method.
