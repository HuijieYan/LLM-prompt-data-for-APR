## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is utilizing weak references to avoid reference cycles. The error message indicates an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, which implies that a `None` type object is being accessed where a method or attribute is expected. This issue is connected to weak references handling within the `_engine` function.

Looking at the expected case, the input `self` should be a `PeriodIndex` object, and `self._values` should be a `PeriodArray` object holding the values '2019Q1' and '2019Q2'. The `_engine` function is expected to return an instance of `PeriodEngine` initialized with a weak reference to `self` and the length of `self`.

## Bug Explanation
The bug appears due to the weak reference setup in the `_engine` function. The weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` stores `self` as a weak reference, but it seems that as the weak reference is utilized to create the `PeriodEngine`, it is not correctly resolving back to the original `self` object. This leads to the `NoneType` object being accessed and subsequently causing the error during the check for monotonicity.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference setup correctly maintains the reference to the `self` object. A potential solution could involve storing both the weak reference to `self` and the actual `self` object separately. This way, the weak reference can be used appropriately to keep track of `self` for the `PeriodEngine` initialization.

## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self) # Create a weak reference
    return self._engine_type(self, period, len(self))  # Make use of weak reference and original 'self' object
```

By modifying the return statement to include both the weak reference and the original `self` object, we ensure that the weak reference retains the necessary link to the original `self` object without losing it. This corrected version should resolve the weak reference issue and eliminate the `NoneType` error during the test execution.
