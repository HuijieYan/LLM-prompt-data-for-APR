## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` method within the `PeriodIndex` class. This method is responsible for returning an instance of the `PeriodEngine` based on the provided `self` (which is an instance of `PeriodIndex`).
2. The error message is related to the `PeriodEngine` trying to access an attribute (`view`) of `NoneType`, leading to an `AttributeError`.
3. The cause of the bug lies in the `_engine` method's implementation, where a weak reference to `self` is passed to `_engine_type`, but the weak reference is not being properly handled in the subsequent usage within `PeriodEngine`.
4. We need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly maintained and accessed within `PeriodEngine`.

## Proposed Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we should modify the `_engine` method to handle the weak reference properly when passing it to `_engine_type`. Additionally, we need to ensure that the weak reference is correctly resolved within `PeriodEngine` to prevent the `NoneType` error.

## Corrected Version
```python
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, we maintain a weak reference that behaves like the original object but does not prevent it from being garbage collected when there are no other strong references. This should resolve the issue and allow the `_engine` method to work correctly.
