### Analysis:
1. The function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is designed to return an engine type using the attributes of the `PeriodIndex` instance. The function is using a weak reference to prevent a reference cycle and calls the `_engine_type` method with the weakly referenced `self`.
   
2. The error is occurring when trying to access an attribute on a `NoneType` object, specifically on `self._engine`. This indicates that `self._engine` is not getting assigned properly, leading to the issue during attribute access.

3. The expected values for the parameters indicate that the function should correctly create the engine using the provided parameters. The error message points to accessing an attribute (`view`) on a `NoneType`, suggesting that the `PeriodEngine` instance is not created successfully.

4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the module's `self._engine` assignment is done correctly, creating an instance of the `PeriodEngine` with the weak reference passed to the `_engine_type` method.

### Bug Fix:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    # Fixed assignment of _engine by creating an instance of PeriodEngine
    self._engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    return self._engine
```

By explicitly assigning the `_engine` attribute in the `_engine` method, we ensure that the PeriodEngine instance is created correctly with the weakly referenced `self`. This fix should address the attribute access error and ensure that the proper engine instance is available for subsequent operations.
