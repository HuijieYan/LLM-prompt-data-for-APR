### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` to avoid a reference cycle.
2. The error message indicates that an AttributeError is raised due to a 'NoneType' object not having the 'view' attribute.
3. Based on the provided information, the expected input values are a `PeriodArray` to `self._values` and a `PeriodIndex` to `self`.
4. The GitHub issue mentions that weak references are dropped prematurely, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` object instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.
5. To address the bug, ensure that the weak reference created using `weakref.ref(self)` remains valid when accessed in the `_engine` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the weak reference to `self` remains valid during the function call. One potential solution is to store the weak reference in an instance attribute, preventing premature garbage collection while allowing access to the referenced object.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a weak reference to self in an instance attribute
    self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference in `self._period_ref`, we ensure that the weak reference remains valid throughout the function call, preventing the 'NoneType' error. This correction should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and satisfy the expected input/output values for the given test case.
