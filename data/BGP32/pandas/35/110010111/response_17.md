## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is intended to return an instance of the `_engine_type` class. It uses `weakref.ref(self)` to avoid reference cycles when creating the `_engine_type` instance.
2. The error message indicates that the `_engine` function is returning a `NoneType` object, causing an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute.
3. When the `_engine` function returns `None`, the subsequent call to `is_monotonic_increasing` on the `_engine` object fails due to the missing `view` attribute.
4. To fix this bug, ensure that the `_engine` function correctly creates and returns an instance of the `_engine_type` class with the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex`.
  
## Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine if engine is not None else self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This corrected version ensures that if the `_engine_type` instance is `None`, a new instance is created and returned. This modification prevents the function from returning `None`, resolving the AttributeError observed in the failing test.
