### Analysis:
1. The buggy function in the `PeriodIndex` class is `_engine(self)`, which returns an instance of `_engine_type` with a weak reference to `self`.
2. The test case fails when invoking `x.is_monotonic` on the `idx2` object, which in turn accesses the `is_monotonic_increasing` property that relies on the `is_monotonic_increasing` method of the `_engine` attribute.
3. The error message indicates that the `_do_monotonic_check` method in the `IndexEngine` class attempts to access the values of the engine, but receives a `NoneType` object indicating that the engine `_engine` attribute is not returning a proper value (likely returning `None` instead of the expected engine object).
4. The bug occurs due to the weak reference usage in the `_engine` function implementation, where the weak reference may not hold the `PeriodIndex` object causing the `self._engine_type` creation to fail.
5. To fix this bug, it's necessary to ensure that the weak reference used in the `_engine` function maintains a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex` object.

### Suggested Fix:
To address the bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to handle the weak reference appropriately and ensure that it maintains a reference to the `PeriodIndex` object when creating the engine. One way to achieve this is by storing the weak reference in a separate variable and retrieving the actual `PeriodIndex` object when needed.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    period = period_ref()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference in `period_ref` and retrieving the actual `PeriodIndex` object into `period`, we ensure that a valid reference is used when constructing the engine. This change should resolve the bug and allow the test case to pass successfully.
