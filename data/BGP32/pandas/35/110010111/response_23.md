### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function Relation with Buggy Class**: The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is attempting to create an engine type for the PeriodIndex instance using weak references to avoid reference cycles.
   
2. **Error Location**: The error occurs when trying to access an attribute of a `NoneType` object, specifically in the `_engine` function. This happens during the check for monotonicity.

3. **Cause of Bug**:
   - **Buggy Function**: The `_engine` function uses weak references to prevent reference cycles in the engine type creation.
   - **Error Message**: The `AttributeError` is raised due to attempting to access an attribute (view method) on a `NoneType` object.
   - **Expected Input/Output Values**: The function should return an instance of the engine type, but it ends up returning `None`.
   - **GitHub Issue Information**: The issue is related to weak references not being handled correctly, leading to dropping the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object.

4. **Bug Fix Strategy**:
   - Ensure that the weak reference handling within the `_engine` function works correctly to prevent prematurely dropping the reference.
   - Update the weak reference logic to properly maintain the reference to `self` during the engine creation.

### Bug-fixed version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        engine = self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
    return engine
```

With this fix, the `_engine` function will correctly handle weak references and ensure that the engine type instance is properly created without any `NoneType` errors.
