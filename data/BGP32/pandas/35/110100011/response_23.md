### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` method within the `PeriodIndex` class. It creates a weak reference to the `self` object and then returns the result of calling `_engine_type` with the weak reference and the length of the current `PeriodIndex` instance.
2. The issue arises when the weak reference `period` is getting collected prematurely, leading to `None` being passed to `_engine_type`.

### Identified potential error location:
The issue seems to be the weak reference `period` being defined inside the `_engine` method. As Python uses a garbage collection mechanism to manage weak references, `period` might be collected before its intended usage.

### Explanation of the bug:
The bug occurs because the weak reference `period` does not hold a strong reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance. When `_engine_type` is called, it receives `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex` instance due to premature garbage collection of the weak reference.

### Fixing strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` holds a strong reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance until it is used by `_engine_type`. One way to achieve this is to store the weak reference `period` as an attribute of the `PeriodIndex` instance itself, thus preventing it from being collected prematurely.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference as an attribute of the object
    self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    period = self._period_ref
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By storing the weak reference as `self._period_ref`, we ensure that the reference is maintained until the `_engine_type` method is called, fixing the premature garbage collection issue. This corrected version should resolve the problem reported in the GitHub issue and pass the failing test.
