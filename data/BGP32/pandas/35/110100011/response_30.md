## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is used to return the `_engine_type` by passing a weak reference of `self` (which is a `PeriodIndex` instance) to it.
2. The bug seems to be related to the weak reference handling, where the `period` variable is being created but not used properly in `_engine_type`.
3. The failing test is checking if the levels of a `MultiIndex` created from a `PeriodIndex` are monotonic, indicating that the weak reference issue impacts this operation.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is properly used in `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.

## Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Passing the weak reference correctly to _engine_type
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self), index=self)
```

By passing the correct weak reference and utilizing it in the `_engine_type`, we ensure that the weak reference is handled properly and the bug is fixed. This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub as well.
