### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class seems to be intended to return an instance of `_engine_type`, passing a weak reference of `self` as an argument.
2. The issue mentioned on GitHub highlights that copying `PeriodIndex` levels in a `MultiIndex` leads to the loss of weakrefs, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.
3. The current implementation of `_engine` does not correctly handle weak references, leading to a potential issue where the reference is lost prematurely.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` remains valid until it is accessed by the `_engine_type`.

### Solution:
To resolve the bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to correctly handle the weak reference and ensure it remains valid throughout the `_engine_type` instantiation.

### Updated corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
# Updated corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Pass a weakref of self to _engine_type using lambda function to retain the weak reference.
    return self._engine_type(lambda: weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

By using a lambda function to create the weakref of `self`, we can ensure that the weak reference remains valid until it is accessed by the `_engine_type`. This change should address the issue reported on GitHub and resolve the bug in the `PeriodIndex` class.
