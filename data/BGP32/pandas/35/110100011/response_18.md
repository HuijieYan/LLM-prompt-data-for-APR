## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is intended to create an instance of the `_engine_type` class with a weak reference to the current `PeriodIndex` instance. However, the weak reference implementation is incorrect causing the reference cycle to be broken.
2. The weak reference to `self` is not being used correctly due to the absence of the needed reference syntax.
3. The failing test, as described in the GitHub issue, is encountering an error because the weak reference method used in `_engine` is not maintaining the weak reference as expected, leading to a `None` being received when trying to access the `PeriodIndex` instance.
4. To fix the bug, the weak reference needs to be stored correctly and accessed properly within the `_engine` function.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Create a weak reference to the `self` instance using the `weakref.ref` method to maintain a reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance.
2. Update the creation of the `_engine` instance with the weak reference to ensure that the reference cycle is not broken.
3. Make sure to dereference the weak reference when required to access the `PeriodIndex` instance.
4. Implement the changes to maintain the weak reference cycle as intended.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
    def _engine(self):
        # Create a weak reference to self
        period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
        
        # Access the weak reference during the initialization of _engine_type
        return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
``` 

By correcting the `_engine` function in this way, it will ensure that the weak reference is maintained properly, preventing the reference cycle from being broken and resolving the issue described in the failing test and GitHub issue.
