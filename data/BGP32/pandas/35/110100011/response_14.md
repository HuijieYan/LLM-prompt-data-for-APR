## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This is done to avoid reference cycles.
2. The issue reported on GitHub highlights that copying `PeriodIndex` levels within a `MultiIndex` results in losing weak references because the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped prematurely.
3. The bug causes the `_engine` function to receive `None` instead of the actual `PeriodIndex`, leading to errors.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is maintained throughout the `_engine` function's lifetime.
5. We will make modifications in the `_engine` function to maintain the weak reference properly.

## Correction:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Modified function to maintain weak reference
    def get_period():
        return self

    period = weakref.ref(get_period())
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, a helper function `get_period` is introduced to retrieve the actual `self` object, ensuring that the weak reference is kept alive until it's needed by `_engine_type`. This modification should resolve the issue and allow the test provided to pass successfully.
