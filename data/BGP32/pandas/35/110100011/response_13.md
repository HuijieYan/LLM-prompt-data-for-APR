### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object, which is the `PeriodIndex` instance. The intention is to avoid reference cycles and potential memory leaks by passing a weak reference to the `_engine_type` method. However, the issue arises because the weak reference is assigned to `period`, which goes out of scope before being passed to `_engine_type`, leading to `None` being passed instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

### Error Locations:
1. The `_engine` function returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, but `self` is captured in a weak reference (`period`), which might get destroyed before being used in `_engine_type`.
2. The weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` is not being utilized correctly to maintain a valid reference during function execution.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by premature deallocation of the weak reference `period`, resulting in passing `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex` instance to `_engine_type`. This leads to unexpected behavior and potential errors when interacting with the `PeriodIndex` object.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is held throughout the `_engine` function execution, so it remains valid when passed to `_engine_type`. One way to achieve this is by storing the weak reference as an attribute of the `self` object or using a different approach to maintain a valid reference.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def _engine(self):
        self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)  # Store weak reference as an attribute
        return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

In this corrected version:
- The weak reference `period` is stored as `self._period_ref` to ensure its validity during the entire `_engine` function execution.
- The stored weak reference is then passed to `_engine_type` when creating the engine, maintaining a proper reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance.

This correction should resolve the issue described in the GitHub bug report and ensure that weak references are handled correctly in the `PeriodIndex` class.
