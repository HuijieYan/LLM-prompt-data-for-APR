**Analysis:**

1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using a `cache_readonly` decorator, implying it is meant to cache the result and avoid recomputing it unnecessarily.
2. The function is creating a weak reference to `self` which should then be used to instantiate the `_engine_type`.
3. The bug arises because the weak reference `period` is not used correctly when instantiating `_engine_type`, leading to the issue described in the GitHub problem.
4. The failing test is related to copying `PeriodIndex` levels in a `MultiIndex`, which leads to losing weak references and failing the test.

**Bug Cause:**
The bug is caused by not properly utilizing the weak reference when passing it to the `_engine_type`. This results in the `_engine` function not having a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex`, causing the test to fail when copying the levels in the `MultiIndex`.

**Bug Fix:**
To fix the bug, the `weakref` object created should be properly dereferenced before passing it to the `_engine_type`. This can be achieved by calling the weak reference object before passing it to `_engine_type`.

**Corrected Version:**

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Dereference the weak reference to get a valid reference to self
        period = weakref.ref(self)()
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By correctly dereferencing the weak reference `period`, we ensure that the `_engine` function has a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance. This should resolve the issue described in the GitHub problem and make the failing test pass.
