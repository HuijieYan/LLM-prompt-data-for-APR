## Analysis
The bug is related to the `_engine` method in the `PeriodIndex` class. The `_engine` method returns an instance of the `_engine_type` class while weakly referencing the `self` object. However, the weak reference created is not being used correctly, leading to a `None` being passed to the `_engine_type` class instead of the `PeriodIndex` object.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` with a `PeriodIndex` as one of its levels. When trying to copy the levels, the weak reference issue causes an error.

The GitHub issue suggests that when weak refs are improperly used, the `PeriodIndex` object gets dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly use the weak reference to `self` in the `_engine` method so that the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained and passed to the `_engine_type` class correctly.

The fix involves ensuring that the weak reference `period` is used to maintain a reference to `self` instead of directly using `self`. This will prevent the `PeriodIndex` object from being dropped prematurely.

## Corrected Version
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `period()` is used to retrieve the original `PeriodIndex` object from the weak reference before passing it to the `_engine_type` class. This ensures that the `PeriodIndex` object is correctly maintained.
