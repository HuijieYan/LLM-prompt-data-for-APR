### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref` incorrectly. It should be passed the `self` reference, not the `self` object itself.
2. The GitHub issue describes the problem with weakrefs being dropped prematurely, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of a `PeriodIndex`.
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` demonstrates the issue with weakrefs being lost when creating a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weakref is created correctly so that the `PeriodIndex` object is properly referenced by the `_engine`.
5. The corrected version of the `_engine` function should pass the failing test by fixing the weakref creation.

### Bug Fix:
```python
    # Corrected version of the buggy `_engine` function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Pass a weak reference to self to _engine_type
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self), freq=self.freq)
```

### Changes Made:
1. Passed `self` to `weakref.ref` to properly create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object.
2. Added `freq=self.freq` when calling `self._engine_type` to maintain the necessary frequency information.

By making these changes, the corrected version of the `_engine` function should now properly maintain the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object and fix the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
