### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` which is the `PeriodIndex` object. This weak reference is later passed to the `_engine_type` constructor. However, the weak reference is not being utilized correctly, leading to potential reference cycle issues.

### Identified potential error locations:
- The weak reference creation `period = weakref.ref(self)` might not be capturing the intended reference.
- The returned value from `weakref.ref(self)` is not being utilized properly in `_engine_type`.

### Cause of the bug:
- The weak reference to `self` created using `weakref.ref(self)` is not stored correctly and is not being used in a meaningful way in the `_engine` function. This leads to potential issues with reference cycles and the `_engine_type` function receiving `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Properly store the weak reference created using `weakref.ref(self)` so that it can be correctly passed to the `_engine_type` constructor.
2. Make sure the weak reference is utilized correctly within the `_engine` function to avoid reference cycle issues.

### Corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
    def _engine(self):
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By creating the weak reference using `weakref.ref(self)` and then immediately calling it using `period()` to obtain the actual reference, we ensure that the reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained correctly without causing any reference cycle issues. This should resolve the bug and address the GitHub issue as well.
