## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is causing issues with weak reference handling leading to errors in the `test_get_level_values_when_periods` test function. The problem lies in how `weakref.ref` is being utilized within the `_engine` function. The weak reference to `self` is not being used properly, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

## Error Location
The issue is within the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class where the weak reference to `self` is not being correctly passed to the `_engine_type`.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs due to the following reasons:
1. The weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` is created but not passed properly to `_engine_type`.
2. This results in the `_engine_type` receiving `None` instead of the intended weak reference to `self`.
3. Consequently, when the `PeriodEngine` tries to access the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex`, it receives `None`, leading to errors.

## Fixing Strategy
To fix the bug, the weak reference `period` needs to be correctly passed to `_engine_type`, ensuring that the intended weak reference to `self` is maintained. By properly handling the weak reference, the `PeriodEngine` should be able to access the `PeriodIndex` as expected, resolving the issue.

## Corrected Version

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Properly pass the weakref of self to _engine_type
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this corrected version, the weak reference to `self` is correctly passed to `_engine_type`, ensuring that the intended reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained, resolving the weak reference issue reported in the GitHub bug.
