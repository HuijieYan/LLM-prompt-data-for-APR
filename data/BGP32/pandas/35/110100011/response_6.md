## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is defined within the `PeriodIndex` class in the `pandas.core.indexes.period` module.
2. The function calculates an `_engine_type` using a weak reference of `self` (an instance of `PeriodIndex`) and the length of `self`.
3. The issue arises because the weak reference `period` is not being used correctly, leading to `None` being passed to `_engine_type`, causing the bug.
4. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex`, but due to the issue in `_engine`, the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is lost.
5. The GitHub issue highlights the specifics of the bug and the expected output.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_engine` function is due to the incorrect usage of a weak reference `period`. When the weak reference is passed to `_engine_type`, it unexpectedly becomes `None`, causing the failure in the test.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the weak reference should be maintained throughout the usage in `_engine` to ensure that the `PeriodIndex` instance does not get lost prematurely.

## Updated Corrected Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By maintaining the weak reference `period` and passing it correctly to `_engine_type`, the corrected function should resolve the bug and pass the failing test.
