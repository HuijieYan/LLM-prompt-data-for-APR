### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` method of the `PeriodIndex` class in the `pandas` library.
2. The function is tasked with returning the `_engine_type` instance with weak reference to the current `PeriodIndex` instance.
3. The bug causes the weak reference to be prematurely dropped, leading to a `None` being passed to the `_engine_type`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `self` reference passed to `weakref.ref()` is retained for the `_engine` method's lifetime.

### Bug Cause:
The root cause of the bug is that the weak reference is not kept alive, leading to it being prematurely garbage collected. As a result, a `None` reference is passed to the `_engine_type`.

### Strategy for Fixing:
To fix the bug, we need to maintain a strong reference to the weak reference created for `self` within the `_engine` method. One way to achieve this is by storing the weak reference as an attribute of the `PeriodIndex` instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Updated _engine method
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    if not hasattr(self, '_weakref_period'):
        self._weakref_period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._weakref_period, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference within the `PeriodIndex` instance, we ensure that the reference remains valid until the `_engine` method is no longer needed. This solution should fix the bug and allow the test case to pass successfully.
