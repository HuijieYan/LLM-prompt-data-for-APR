### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `@cache_readonly` decorator that returns an engine type using a weak reference to `self`. The issue seems to be related to handling weak references incorrectly.
2. The GitHub issue highlights that weak references are lost prematurely, causing the engine to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.
3. The failing test attempts to create a `MultiIndex` with `PeriodIndex` levels and then checks if the levels are monotonic, which fails due to weakref loss.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure the weak reference is maintained correctly until it is no longer needed.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
Correct the implementation of weak reference usage to prevent premature garbage collection of the referenced object.

### Corrected Function:
```python
    # Corrected _engine function with proper weak reference handling
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Function to create the engine type using a weak reference to self
        def create_engine():
            period = weakref.ref(self)
            return self._engine_type(period, len(self))

        # Use a local variable in the closure to maintain the weak reference
        engine = create_engine()
        return engine
```

Applying this correction should address the issue by ensuring that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until the engine is created successfully. This modification should resolve the premature loss of weak reference reported in the GitHub issue.
