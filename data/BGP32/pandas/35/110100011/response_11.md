### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class in the `period.py` file is using weak referencing through `weakref.ref`. The function is trying to avoid a reference cycle by passing a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`.
2. The issue arises when the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object is dropped prematurely, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` object instead of the actual `PeriodIndex`.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the weak reference created by `period = weakref.ref(self)` in the `_engine` function is not being held onto correctly. As a result, when the `_engine_type` is called with `period` as an argument, the weak reference has already been deallocated, leading to `None` being passed instead. This behavior contradicts the intention of using weak referencing to avoid reference cycles.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference created within the `_engine` function is kept alive until its intended use in `_engine_type`. One way to achieve this is to store the weak reference as an instance variable of `PeriodIndex` so that it persists throughout the lifetime of the object.

### Corrected Code:

```python
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    """
    Immutable ndarray holding ordinal values indicating regular periods in time.
    Index keys are boxed to Period objects which carry the metadata (e.g., frequency information).
    ...
    """

    def __init__(self, data=None, copy=False, freq=None, year=None, month=None, quarter=None, day=None,
                 hour=None, minute=None, second=None, tz=None, dtype=None):
        self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
        super(PeriodIndex, self).__init__(data=data, copy=copy, freq=freq, year=year, month=month, quarter=quarter,
                                          day=day, hour=hour, minute=minute, second=second, tz=tz, dtype=dtype)

    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

In the corrected version:
1. We initialize `self._period_ref` in the `__init__` method to hold a weak reference to `self`.
2. When `_engine` is called, it uses `self._period_ref` to pass a proper weak reference to `_engine_type`.

This modification ensures that the weak reference persists as long as the `PeriodIndex` object exists, resolving the premature deallocation issue and fixing the bug.
