### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using weak reference `weakref.ref(self)` to avoid reference cycles.
2. The bug causes the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to be dropped prematurely before intended, leading to passing `None` to the `PeriodEngine`.
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` tries to create `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex`, leading to the bug being triggered due to weak reference handling.
4. To fix the bug, the weak reference handling in the `_engine` function needs to be revised to maintain the reference as expected.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to premature dropping of weakly referenced `PeriodIndex`, resulting in a `None` value passed to the `PeriodEngine`, causing the test failure.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the weak reference handling in the `_engine` function to ensure the reference is maintained until the intended time.
2. Update the `_engine` function to correctly pass the weak reference without dropping it.

### Corrected Version:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we maintain the weak reference until the `_engine` function completes its operation, preventing premature dropping of the reference. This modification ensures that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is correctly passed to the `PeriodEngine` without encountering the bug.
