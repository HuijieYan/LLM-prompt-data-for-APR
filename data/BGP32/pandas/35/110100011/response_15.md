### Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship:

1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` function in the `PeriodIndex` class.
2. The function is returning an instance of `_engine_type` by passing a weak reference of `self` (PeriodIndex object) to it.
3. The `PeriodIndex` class is a subclass of `DatetimeIndexOpsMixin` and `Int64Index`.
4. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is trying to create a MultiIndex object from a PeriodIndex, where the issue arises.

### Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The usage of `weakref.ref(self)` which might cause the reference cycle to break unexpectedly.

### Cause of the bug:
1. In the `_engine` function, `period = weakref.ref(self)` creates a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object, `self`.
2. Due to the nature of weak references, if the original reference to the `PeriodIndex` object `self` is removed or lost prematurely, the weak reference `period` might point to None.
3. This behavior leads to the `_engine_type` function receiving None instead of the intended `PeriodIndex` object.
4. Consequently, operations on the `PeriodIndex` object result in unexpected behavior and errors, as seen in the failing test.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Since the weak reference behavior seems unnecessary in this context and leads to the bug, the `weakref.ref(self)` line can be removed, ensuring a strong reference is maintained throughout the lifetime of the `_engine` function.
2. By maintaining a strong reference to `self` within `_engine`, the `_engine_type` function will receive the correct `PeriodIndex` object, resolving the issue and allowing the intended operations to succeed.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
    def _engine(self):
        return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By removing the weak reference creation and directly passing `self` to the `_engine_type` function, the corrected version of the `_engine` function ensures a strong reference to the `PeriodIndex` object, resolving the bug and allowing the failing test to pass.
