### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file is making use of a weak reference to itself.
2. The function intends to avoid a reference cycle by passing a weak reference of the `PeriodIndex` instance to `_engine_type`, but it incorrectly defines the `period` variable as a weak reference.
3. The bug is causing the `Period` object to become `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`, leading to unexpected behavior when accessing the PeriodEngine.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is appropriately created, maintained, and used within the `_engine` function.

### Proposed Fix:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Correct way to create weak reference using weakref.ref
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

By fixing the weak reference creation in the `_engine` function, the corrected version should resolve the issue of weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped incorrectly. This should allow the PeriodEngine to receive the expected `PeriodIndex` instead of `None`.
