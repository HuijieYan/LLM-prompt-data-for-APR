### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class is using a weak reference incorrectly.
2. The issue is due to the weak reference being assigned to `period` without holding a strong reference to the referred object.
3. The weak reference is meant to avoid reference cycles, but the weak reference `period` is getting garbage collected and returning `None`, leading to the failure in functionality.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that there is a strong reference to the `PeriodIndex` object while using the weak reference.

### Bug Fix:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(lambda: period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we use a lambda function to capture a strong reference to `self` within `PeriodIndex` before calling `period()`. This ensures that the weak reference does not get garbage collected prematurely.

By making this change, we ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object is retained properly for use in the `_engine_type` function, resolving the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
