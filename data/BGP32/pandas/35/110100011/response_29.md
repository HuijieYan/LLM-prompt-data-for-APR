### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function**: The `_engine` function inside the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref` to create a weak reference to the `self` object (which is an instance of `PeriodIndex`) and then using it to create the `_engine_type`.
   
2. **Test Function**: The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is trying to ensure that copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` does not lose weakrefs by building a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex`. However, it fails due to a problem with the weak reference in the `_engine` function.

3. **GitHub Issue**: The reported bug indicates that the weak reference to `PeriodIndex` is being dropped prematurely, leading to the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused because the weak reference `period` is not being properly stored within the `self` object. As a result, when the `_engine` function is called, the weak reference `period` might be garbage collected prematurely, leading to `None` being passed to `_engine_type`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is stored within the `self` object so that it is not garbage collected prematurely. We can achieve this by storing the weak reference as an attribute of the `self` object to maintain its reference.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    self._period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference `period` as an attribute `_period` of the `self` object, we avoid premature garbage collection, ensuring that `_engine_type` receives the expected `PeriodIndex` reference. This fix should resolve the bug and make the failing test pass.
