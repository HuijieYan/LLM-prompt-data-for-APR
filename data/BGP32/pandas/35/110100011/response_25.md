## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` (the `PeriodIndex` object) and then returning the weak reference.
2. The issue occurs when this weak reference (`period`) is used to initialize `self._engine_type` but does not point to the actual `PeriodIndex` object.
3. This bug causes the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex` object, resulting in erroneous behavior.

## Fixing the Bug:
To fix this issue, we need to maintain a reference to the `PeriodIndex` object correctly so that it is not lost during the weak reference creation. We can achieve this by storing a strong reference to the `self` object before creating the weak reference. This way, the weak reference will point to the correct object, preventing the reference cycle avoidance problem.

## Corrected Version of the `_engine` Function:

```python
# Corrected version of the _engine function in PeriodIndex class

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a strong reference to self
    period = self
    # Create a weak reference to the stored PeriodIndex object
    period_weak = weakref.ref(period)
    return self._engine_type(period_weak, len(self))
```

By storing a strong reference to `self` before creating the weak reference, we ensure that the weak reference points to the correct `PeriodIndex` object. This correction should resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue and enable the `test_get_level_values_when_periods` function to pass successfully.
