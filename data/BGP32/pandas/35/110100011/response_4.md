### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` which is the current `PeriodIndex` instance. However, the weak reference is not being correctly passed to the `_engine_type` function resulting in losing the reference to `self`.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` involves creating a `MultiIndex` with `PeriodIndex` levels and then checking if the levels are monotonic. The bug causes the weak references to be lost, leading to errors in the test.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from not correctly passing the weak reference instance to `_engine_type` in the `_engine` function, resulting in a loss of reference to `self`, causing issues in subsequent operations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly passed to `_engine_type` within the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. By correctly preserving the weak reference, the issue of losing the reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance can be resolved.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, self)
```

In the corrected version above, the weak reference `period` is passed to the `_engine_type` function along with `self` to ensure that the reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance is maintained during subsequent operations. This fix should address the issue and make the failing test pass successfully.
