### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_engine` is a part of the `PeriodIndex` class.
- The function is utilizing a `weakref` to create a weak reference to `self` (an instance of `PeriodIndex`) in order to avoid reference cycles.
- The function then attempts to return the result of calling `_engine_type` with the weak reference and the length of `self`.
- The key issue is that the weak reference `period` is not being utilized correctly and is not maintaining a reference to `self`.

### Errors:
1. The `weakref` object `period` is created but not used appropriately.
2. Due to the incorrect usage of weak references, the intended safeguard against reference cycles is not being applied.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the weak reference `period` not being used correctly. This leads to the `PeriodIndex` instance being potentially garbage collected before it should be, resulting in a `None` being passed to `_engine_type` instead of the valid `PeriodIndex`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the weak reference `period` correctly maintains a reference to `self` throughout the function's execution. This can be achieved by dereferencing the weak reference when using it to call `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Correctly dereference the weak reference to maintain a reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

This corrected version ensures that we extract the weak reference's value using `period()` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This way, the weak reference is correctly utilized, and we maintain a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance.
