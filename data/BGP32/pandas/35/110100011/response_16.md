### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance. However, the weak reference is not being maintained correctly, which leads to `None` being passed to `_engine_type` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. In the implementation of the `_engine` function, where the weak reference to `self` is created.
2. Issue might be related to garbage collection and weak references.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of weak references in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. Due to improper management of weak references, the assigned weak reference (`period`) is getting deallocated before being used by `_engine_type`, resulting in `None` being passed instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the weak reference to `self` needs to be maintained properly during the lifetime of the `_engine` function. One possible approach is to store the weak reference to `self` as an instance variable to ensure it is not deallocated prematurely.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Store weak reference to self in an instance variable
        self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)

        # Pass the stored weak reference to _engine_type
        return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference as `self._period_ref`, we ensure that the reference remains valid until the `_engine` function has completed its execution, allowing `_engine_type` to receive the intended `PeriodIndex` instance without being `None`.
