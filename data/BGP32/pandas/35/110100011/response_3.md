### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`. However, it is not being used correctly, resulting in a reference cycle issue.
2. The current implementation of the `_engine` function is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, which is causing the issue.
3. The bug is related to losing weakrefs in copying `PeriodIndex` levels in `MultiIndex`. The failing test demonstrates this issue by checking the monotonicity of the levels, which should return True but raises an error.
4. To fix the bug, we can avoid weak referencing `self` and directly pass `self` as an argument to `_engine_type`, removing the weakref usage.

### Bug Fix:
```python
# Fix for the buggy function
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By directly passing `self` to `_engine_type`, we avoid the weak referencing issue and resolve the bug related to losing weakrefs in copying `PeriodIndex` levels. This fix should ensure that the failing test passes and resolves the GitHub issue related to weakrefs in `PeriodIndex`.
