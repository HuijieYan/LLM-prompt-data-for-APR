### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` property within the `PeriodIndex` class.
2. The purpose of this function is to avoid a reference cycle by using `weakref` to pass a weak reference to `self` (`PeriodIndex` instance) into `_engine_type`.
3. The bug is causing the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to be dropped prematurely, resulting in `_engine_type` receiving `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until `_engine_type` is instantiated.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by premature deletion of the weak reference to `PeriodIndex` within the `_engine` property. This results in `_engine_type` receiving `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to maintain the weak reference to `PeriodIndex` until its usage within `_engine_type` is complete. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference to `self` in a variable outside the function scope.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a separate variable for the weak reference to avoid premature deletion
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

By ensuring that the weak reference is stored in a separate variable, we prevent premature deletion and provide the expected `PeriodIndex` instance to `_engine_type`.
