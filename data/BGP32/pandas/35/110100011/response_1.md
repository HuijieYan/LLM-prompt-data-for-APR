### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to itself and passing it to `_engine_type` to avoid a reference cycle.
2. The issue reported on GitHub suggests that when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`, the weak references are lost due to improper handling of weak references in the `_engine` function.
3. The bug causes the `_engine` function to receive `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`, leading to unexpected behavior in the code.
  
### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the bug reported, the weak reference creation process in the `_engine` function should be modified to ensure that the weak reference to `self` remains valid throughout the function execution. By adjusting the weak reference handling, the `_engine` function should be able to correctly pass the `PeriodIndex` object to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Changed weak reference handling to ensure it stays alive during function execution
        return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we create a proxy object that maintains a weak reference to `self` without creating a reference cycle and ensures that the `PeriodIndex` object is correctly passed to `_engine_type`. This modification should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
