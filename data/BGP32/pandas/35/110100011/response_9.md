### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is supposed to return an instance of `_engine_type` with a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object. The issue arises because the weak reference is created incorrectly and does not maintain a reference to the `PeriodIndex` object as intended. This results in the `_engine` function returning an instance with a None value instead of the PeriodIndex object.

### Error Locations:
The error is within the `_engine` function where the weak reference is created incorrectly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex` object, resulting in unexpected behavior and errors when accessing attributes or methods that rely on the `PeriodEngine`.

### Strategy for Fixing:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference created inside the `_engine` function correctly points to the `PeriodIndex` object, so the PeriodEngine receives a valid reference.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Corrected weak reference creation
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we call the weak reference object `period()` to obtain a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex` object before passing it to the `PeriodEngine` instance creation. This change ensures that the `PeriodEngine` receives a valid reference and resolves the bug.
