### Analysis
- The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` on `self` to avoid reference cycles.
- The error message indicates that an `AttributeError` is being raised because `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.
- The failing test is testing whether the levels of `idx2` are monotonic, but the bug causes an issue with determining if the levels are monotonic.

### Bug Cause
The bug is likely due to `weakref` not being used correctly in `_engine`. When `weakref.ref(self)` is called, it creates a weak reference to `self`, but the usage of this weak reference is incorrect, resulting in a `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the way the weak reference is being used needs to be adjusted. Instead of just storing the weak reference in `period`, it should be dereferenced when accessing the object.

### Corrected Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref(), len(self))
``` 

By dereferencing the weak reference using `period_ref()` before passing it to `_engine_type`, we ensure that we pass the actual object instead of a weak reference to it, fixing the bug.
