### Explanation:
The error message indicates that an `AttributeError` is raised because the 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'. This suggests that a variable is expected to have a certain attribute but is instead `None`. The function `_engine` attempts to use `self._engine_type` with `period` and the length of `self` but fails to create the engine properly.

### Bug in the code:
The issue seems to be with the creation of the weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)`, which is not being correctly passed to `self._engine_type`. This results in an incorrect object being assigned or returned, leading to the `AttributeError`.

### Fix strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is correctly handled when passed to `self._engine_type`.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

### Updated error-free version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By using `weakref.proxy()` instead of `weakref.ref()`, we ensure that the weak reference functions correctly as intended.
