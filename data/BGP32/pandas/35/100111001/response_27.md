### Analyzing the buggy function and failing test
- The buggy function `_engine` is supposed to create an engine instance using a weak reference to the `self` object and pass it to `_engine_type`.
- The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` constructs a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` and then attempts to check if all levels are monotonic.

### Error in the Buggy Function
- The bug seems to be related to the initialization of `period` as a weak reference to `self`.
- The weak reference is not correctly passed to `_engine_type`, resulting in a `NoneType` error when trying to access the `view` attribute.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Modify the initialization of the weak reference to properly pass it to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

By invoking `period()` and passing it to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the weak reference is correctly resolved to the original object. This modification should fix the bug.
