### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` uses `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is a `PeriodIndex` object, and then calls `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` constructs a `PeriodIndex` object `idx` and then creates a new `MultiIndex` object `idx2` using `MultiIndex.from_arrays`. The failing assertion `assert all(x.is_monotonic for x in idx2.levels)` checks the monotonicity of the levels in `idx2`.

The error occurs at the assertion because when `is_monotonic_increasing` is accessed in `BaseIndex`, it tries to access `self._engine.is_monotonic_increasing`, leading to an error where `PeriodEngine` does not have the attribute `view` during the monotonicity check, failing the assertion.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect implementation of `_engine` in `PeriodIndex`. The weak reference to `self` is not being correctly utilized or maintained, causing the error when accessing attributes of the engine.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly managed in the `_engine` function. This may involve updating how the weak reference is being used or potentially modifying the `PeriodEngine` class itself.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)).vgetter().view("i8")
``` 

By modifying the return statement to directly access the `vgetter().view("i8")` method of the `_engine_type` object, we ensure that the correct attributes are accessible, fixing the bug.
