### Bug Explanation:

The error message indicates an `AttributeError` related to the `PeriodEngine` class. This error occurs when trying to access the `view` attribute of a `NoneType` object, which typically indicates that the `PeriodEngine` instance is not being properly initialized or assigned.

Looking at the `_engine` function, the issue seems to be with how `weakref.ref(self)` is being used. The weak reference created with `weakref.ref(self)` should be dereferenced to obtain the actual object when needed. However, the code returns the weak reference itself instead of dereferencing it, which could lead to the `NoneType` error seen in the failing test.

### Fix Strategy:

1. Dereference the weak reference obtained from `weakref.ref(self)` before passing it to `self._engine_type()` in order to actually get the underlying object.

### Corrected Code:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Dereference the weak reference to obtain the actual object
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By dereferencing the weak reference with `period()` before passing it to the `_engine_type()` function, the corrected code should address the `NoneType` error and allow the test to pass successfully.
