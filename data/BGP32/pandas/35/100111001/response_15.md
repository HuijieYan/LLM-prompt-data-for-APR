### Analysis
The error message indicates an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute on a `NoneType` object. This suggests that the `_engine` function is returning `None` instead of the expected value.

Looking at the implementation of the `_engine` function, it seems like there might be an issue with how the `weakref` is being used. The `period` variable is created as a weak reference to `self`, but it is not properly utilized when calling the `_engine_type` function. This could lead to the `_engine_type` function not correctly receiving the reference to `self`.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the weak reference not being properly passed to the `_engine_type` function, resulting in `None` being returned instead of the expected engine type.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to correctly dereference the weak reference to `self` before passing it to the `_engine_type` function. We can achieve this by calling `period()` to get the actual object reference from the weak reference. This ensures that the `_engine_type` function receives the correct reference to `self`.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
