### Analysis
The error occurs at the line `return super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter().view("i8")`, indicating that the `vgetter()` attribute is returning a `NoneType`, causing the subsequent error when trying to get the 'view' attribute.

### Bug Cause
The `_engine` function is returning the result of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, but the issue lies in the implementation of `_engine_type` or how `self` is being passed to it. The function is not properly creating an instance of the `PeriodEngine` class, leading to a `NoneType` being returned.

### Fix Strategy
Ensure that the `PeriodEngine` instance is properly instantiated and returned by `_engine`, so that it contains the necessary attributes like `vgetter()`.

### The corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    if engine is not None:
        return engine
    else:
        return self._engine_type(None, len(self))
```
