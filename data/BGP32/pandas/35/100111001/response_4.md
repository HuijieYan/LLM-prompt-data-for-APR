### Analysis
1. The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` (which is an instance of `PeriodIndex`). The `self._engine_type` function is then called with this weak reference and the length of `self`.
2. The error message indicates that there is an issue with an attribute `view` of type `NoneType`.
3. The failing test is related to `is_monotonic` and `is_monotonic_increasing`, which are attributes accessed via the `_engine` method.
4. The bug seems to be related to the `_engine_type` method returning `None`, which causes the subsequent attribute errors when trying to access `view`.
5. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine_type` method returns a valid engine object to avoid returning `None`.

### Fix
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("Engine type is None")
    return engine
``` 

By explicitly checking if the `_engine_type` method returns `None` and raising an error if it does, we prevent the subsequent attribute errors. This fix should resolve the issue with the failing test.
