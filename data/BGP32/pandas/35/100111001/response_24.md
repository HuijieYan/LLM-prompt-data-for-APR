### Analysis:
1. The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref` on `self`, which should create a weak reference object for the `self` object.
2. The function is attempting to use this weak reference object with `self._engine_type` to create the engine object, but it seems there is an issue during this process which leads to a `NoneType` error.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by an incorrect implementation of creating the weak reference object using `weakref.ref(self)`. This could lead to the weak reference object not being able to correctly access the necessary attributes of `self` resulting in the `NoneType` error.

### Bug Fix:
Correct the way the weak reference object is created to properly access the attributes of `self`, ensuring that the necessary information is not lost or inaccessible leading to the `NoneType` error.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self) if self is not None else None
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if self is not None else None
```
