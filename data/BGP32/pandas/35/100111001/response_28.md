### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is meant to return the engine type for the `PeriodIndex` class. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` related to `NoneType` when trying to access the attribute `view`. This suggests that the `_engine_type` being returned might be `None`.

### Bug Cause
1. The `period = weakref.ref(self)` line suggests that a weak reference to the `self` object is created, but this weak reference isn't properly handled afterwards.
2. The return statement `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))` might be failing to create the correct engine type.

### Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly utilized within the `_engine` function.
2. Verify that the `_engine_type` being created and returned is not `None`.

### Corrected Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    # Check if engine_type is None before returning
    if engine_type is None:
        raise ValueError("Engine type creation failed.")
    
    return engine_type
```

By ensuring that the engine type is properly created and not `None`, the corrected function should address the `AttributeError` issue encountered in the failing test.
