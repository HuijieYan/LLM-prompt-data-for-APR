### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is causing an error when trying to access an attribute `view` on a `NoneType` object. This error occurs when trying to return a view of the data as an `i8` integer.

The issue seems to be related to the `_engine_type` function or its initialization, as it is returning a `NoneType` object instead of the expected engine object.

### Potential Error Location
The potential error could be in the initialization of `self._engine_type` where it is not properly assigning an engine object.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `_engine` function returning a `NoneType` object instead of an actual engine object, leading to the AttributeError when trying to access properties of this `NoneType` object.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the `_engine_type` initialization should ensure that it properly creates and returns an engine object instead of `None`. This could involve checking the implementation of `_engine_type` to correct any issues with the instantiation of the engine.

### Corrected Version
You can try correcting the issue by updating the `_engine` function as follows:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("Engine type initialization failed.")
    
    return engine
```

By adding a check for `engine` after its initialization and raising an error if it is `None`, we can prevent the AttributeError from occurring and ensure that a valid engine object is returned.
