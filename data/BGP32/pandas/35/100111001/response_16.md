### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, intending to avoid reference cycles. However, the issue seems to be related to the implementation of `_engine_type`, leading to the `AttributeError`.
2. The failing test is attempting to check if all levels in `idx2` are monotonic, triggering the error when checking for monotonicity.
3. The error message `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` suggests that the `view` attribute is being accessed on a `NoneType` object, causing the test to fail.
4. The bug likely arises from the incorrect instantiation of the engine type in `_engine`. Modifying the implementation of `_engine` to correctly initialize the engine type should alleviate the issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine` function correctly creates the engine type instance without any NoneType issues. We can achieve this by modifying the implementation of the `_engine` function.

### Corrected Code
```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    engine._engine_type = engine
    return engine
``` 

By setting `engine._engine_type = engine`, we are ensuring that the engine type is properly initialized, resolving the NoneType error and potentially fixing the failing test.
