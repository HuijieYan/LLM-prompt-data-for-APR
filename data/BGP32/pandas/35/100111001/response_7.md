### Analysis
- The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is then passed to `self._engine_type`.
- The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `view("i8")` operation on a `NoneType` object.
- Since the error is related to attribute access on a `NoneType`, it suggests that `_engine_type` might not be returning a valid object.

### Bug Cause
- The `_engine_type` function may return `None` instead of the expected engine object, leading to attribute access errors.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Ensure that the `_engine_type` function returns a valid engine object instead of `None` to prevent attribute access errors when accessing methods or properties.
- Validate the return value of `_engine_type` to handle cases where it returns `None`.

### Corrected Version
```python
# Modified _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("Engine type returned None")
    return engine
```
