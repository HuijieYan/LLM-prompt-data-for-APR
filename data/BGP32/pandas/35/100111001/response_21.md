### Analysis
- The `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error indicates that the `vgetter()` method in the `PeriodEngine` class is returning `None`, causing the subsequent `view("i8")` call to fail.
- This issue is likely due to the weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` not functioning as intended, resulting in the reference being lost and `self._engine_type` being called on a `NoneType`.

### Bug Cause
- The weak reference to the `self` object is not maintained properly, leading to a `NoneType` object being used in the `_engine_type` call, causing the error.

### Fix Strategy
- Ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly maintained throughout the `_engine` function to avoid losing the reference.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
    # Ensure to call period() to get the actual object from the weak reference
    return engine
```
