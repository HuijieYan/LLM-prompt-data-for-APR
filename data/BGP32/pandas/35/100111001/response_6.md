### Explanation
The buggy function `_engine` seems to be returning a weak reference to `self` instead of the actual object, causing an `AttributeError` when trying to access the method `view("i8")` on a `NoneType` object.

In the failing test, `idx2` is being created using the `_get_level_values` method of `idx`. Eventually, `is_monotonic` is called on elements of `idx2.levels`, triggering the error when trying to access `view("i8") on the internal engine.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct engine type is returned by the `_engine` function instead of a weak reference to `self`.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
``` 

By directly returning `self` instead of a weak reference to `self`, the corrected version ensures that the engine object is accessible when accessing `view("i8") later on.

By making this adjustment, the corrected version should resolve the `AttributeError` issue and pass the failing test successfully.
