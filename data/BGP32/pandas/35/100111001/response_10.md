### Analysis
The bug seems to be related to the `_engine` function in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file, where a weak reference of `self` is being passed to the `_engine_type`, which is resulting in an `AttributeError` later on when trying to access an attribute of a `NoneType` object.

From the failing test, we can see that the `idx2.levels` are being checked for monotonicity. This involves checking the `is_monotonic` property, which internally tries to access the `_engine`'s `is_monotonic_increasing` property, leading to the error.

The issue arises because the `_engine` function is returning `None`, resulting in the subsequent error when trying to view an attribute of `None`.

### Bug Explanation
The function `_engine` seems to be incorrectly returning `None` instead of the intended engine object, causing the subsequent `AttributeError`.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine` function returns the correct engine object instead of `None`. We can achieve this by correcting the weak reference usage in the `_engine` function.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we ensure that the correct object is passed to `_engine_type`, resolving the issue with the `NoneType` object.
