### Analysis
The error message indicates an `AttributeError` related to a `NoneType` object not having an attribute `'view'`. This error occurs in the `is_monotonic_increasing` method of the `IndexEngine` class. The root cause is likely in the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class. The `_engine_type` method seems to be returning a `None` object leading to the `AttributeError`.

### Bug Cause
The `_engine` method is returning `None` instead of the expected `IndexEngine` instance due to a weak reference not being properly handled.

### Fix Strategy
Ensure that the weak reference is correctly handled and the `_engine_type` method returns the expected `IndexEngine` instance.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    if engine is None:
        return self._default_index_engine()
    
    return engine
``` 

By handling the case where the `_engine_type` method returns `None` and providing a fallback to `_default_index_engine()`, the issue causing the `AttributeError` should be resolved.
