### Analysis
The error message is indicating an `AttributeError` related to a `NoneType` object not having the attribute `view`. This suggests that the `_engine` function is returning a `None` object, leading to this error when trying to access attributes of that object.

### Bug Cause
In the `_engine` function, the weak reference `period` is created but not properly used when instantiating `_engine_type`. This could lead to the `_engine_type` function receiving a `None` object instead of the intended reference to `self`, resulting in the AttributeError.

### Bug Fix
To fix this issue, we need to properly utilize the weak reference `period` to ensure that the `_engine_type` function receives a valid reference to `self`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By making the correction to pass `period()` instead of `period` to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the weak reference is correctly dereferenced, providing the actual object referenced by `self`. This should resolve the `AttributeError` issue in the failing test.
