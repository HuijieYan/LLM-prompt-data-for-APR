### Analysis
The error message indicates an `AttributeError` related to the `view()` method, suggesting that a `NoneType` object is being accessed inappropriately. This error is likely coming from the `_engine` function trying to access properties of the engine that are not correctly instantiated.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the `weakref.ref(self)` statement generates a weak reference to `self` but does not correctly maintain a reference to the original object. As a result, when `self._engine_type` is called, it is trying to access properties of a `NoneType` object instead of the intended data.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should return the actual reference to `self`, rather than a weak reference. This way, the `self._engine_type` function will correctly refer to the object properties.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
``` 

After making this change, re-run the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` to ensure that it passes without any `AttributeError`.
