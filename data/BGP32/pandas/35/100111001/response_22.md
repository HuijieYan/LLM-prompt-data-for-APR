### Analysis
1. The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, but it is not handling it correctly in the subsequent operation `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.
2. The error message indicates an AttributeError related to `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, suggesting that a NoneType object is being accessed.
3. This issue is causing the failing test due to an incorrect handling of weak references, leading to the NoneType error when trying to access attributes.
4. To fix this bug, the weak reference must be correctly utilized and managed to avoid referencing NoneType objects.

### Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use weak reference correctly
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine if engine is not None else self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

This fix ensures that the weak reference is correctly handled and if it points to None, the function falls back to using a direct reference to `self` to create the engine.
