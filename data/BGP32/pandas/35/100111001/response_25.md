### Analyzing the bug

The buggy function `_engine` is causing an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` when trying to access the `view` attribute of a `NoneType` object. This error arises when calling the `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` line in the `_engine` function.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` provides a `PeriodIndex` object as an input to the function. The `self` parameter inside the `_engine` function is a `PeriodIndex` object. From the runtime values and types provided, it seems that the issue occurs due to the `self` parameter being a `PeriodIndex` instance and something going wrong when trying to manipulate the weakref object `period`.

### Suggested Fix

- The weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` might not be sufficient to create a proper weak reference instance. We need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is properly referenced.
- Check the creation and utilization of the weak reference. Ensure that the weak reference is being properly handled and used to avoid any `NoneType` objects in the process.

Let's correct the `_engine` function: 

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This correction uses `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference that behaves like a reference to the original object but maintains the weak reference properties.
