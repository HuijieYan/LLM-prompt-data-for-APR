### Analysis
The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is attempting to check if the levels of a MultiIndex are monotonic using the `is_monotonic` attribute. However, the bug lies in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class, which returns a value of type `PeriodEngine`. The error message `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` indicates that there is an issue with returning `None` instead of the expected `PeriodEngine`.

### Bug Explanation
The `_engine` function is using weak references incorrectly, leading to a situation where it is returning `None` instead of the intended `PeriodEngine` instance. This causes an error when accessing attributes or methods on the returned value.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is correctly maintaining a reference to the `self` object to avoid premature garbage collection. This can be done by modifying the way the weak reference is created or ensuring that the weak reference is accessed properly in the `_engine_type` constructor.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        raise RuntimeError("Failed to create PeriodEngine")
    return engine
```

By ensuring that the returned engine instance is not `None`, we can avoid the `AttributeError` when accessing attributes or methods on an incorrect object.
