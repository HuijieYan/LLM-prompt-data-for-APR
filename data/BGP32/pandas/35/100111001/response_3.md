### Analysis
- The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is an instance of `PeriodIndex`.
- The error message indicates that there is an issue with trying to access a `view` attribute on a `NoneType` object, suggesting that the `_engine` function is returning `None` instead of the expected engine object.
- This issue is causing the failing test to fail when trying to access the `is_monotonic` attribute on the `idx2.levels` objects.

### Bug Cause
The bug in the `_engine` function is likely due to the possible destruction of the weak reference before it is actually used to create the engine object.

### Fix Strategy
Ensure that the weak reference `period` is kept alive until it is used to create the engine object. This can be achieved by storing the result of `weakref.ref(self)` into a variable within the `_engine` function and then using that variable to create the engine object.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    period = period_ref()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
