### Analysis
1. The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, but it should be passing the actual object to `_engine_type`.
2. The error message indicates an AttributeError related to 'NoneType' object, suggesting that the `_engine` function is returning `None` instead of the expected object.
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is checking if the levels generated by `MultiIndex.from_arrays` are monotonic, but the `_engine` function is not returning the correct object, resulting in the error.

### Bug Explanation
The bug is causing the `_engine` function to return `None` instead of the expected object, leading to the AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute. This incorrect behavior is causing the failing test to encounter an unexpected failure.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we should modify the `_engine` function to correctly pass `self` (actual object) to `_engine_type` instead of a weak reference.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the `_engine` function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
