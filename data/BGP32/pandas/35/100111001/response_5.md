### Bug Explanation
The bug lies in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file. The error message indicates that the `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` is occurring when trying to return `super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter().view("i8")` within the `_engine` function. This means that `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` is returning a `NoneType` object instead of the expected `PeriodEngine` object.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to analyze why `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` is returning `None` instead of a valid `PeriodEngine` object. One potential issue might be related to how `self._engine_type` is defined or how `weakref.ref(self)` is being used. We need to ensure that the `PeriodEngine` object is correctly created and returned.

### The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

from pandas.util._decorators import Appender, cache_readonly, doc

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_result = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine_result is None:
        return self._default_engine()  # Returning a default engine in case _engine_type failed
    return engine_result
```

With this corrected version, the `_engine` function will first check if `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` returns a valid engine object. If it doesn't, it will return a default engine object. This should prevent the `AttributeError` that was occurring before.
