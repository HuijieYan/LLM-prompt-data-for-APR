### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is trying to create a weak reference to the `self` object (an instance of `PeriodIndex`) and then pass this weak reference as an argument to the `_engine_type` method. However, the error occurs when trying to access the weak reference later.

Looking at the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods`, we see that the test involves creating a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex`, which eventually calls the `is_monotonic` method on the levels of the `MultiIndex`. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` related to a `NoneType` object not having the attribute 'view'.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the way the weak reference to `self` is being handled in the `_engine` function. The reference to the `self` object is not correctly passed or accessed later on, leading to the `NoneType` error.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the correct reference to `self` is maintained throughout the `_engine` function so that it can be accessed without issues in the future.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period.__self__, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, the code now accesses the weak reference correctly using `period.__self__`. This change should resolve the `AttributeError` issue and make the function work correctly within the context of the failing test.
