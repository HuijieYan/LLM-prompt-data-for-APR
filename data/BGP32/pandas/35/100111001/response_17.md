### Analysis
- The `self` parameter is a `PeriodIndex` object containing two periods ('2019Q1' and '2019Q2').
- The `_engine` function returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.

### Issues
1. In the `_engine` function, `period` is assigned a weak reference to `self`, but it is not being used correctly when calling `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.
2. The error message indicates an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, which suggests that the `PeriodEngine` instance is returning `None` instead of a valid object.

### Bug Cause
The weak reference `period` is not being used properly, which might be preventing the correct instantiation of the `PeriodEngine` object, leading to it being `None`.

### Fix Strategy
- Ensure that the weak reference `period` is correctly utilized when passing it to `self._engine_type`.
- Investigate why the `PeriodEngine` might not be instantiated correctly.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    period = period_ref()  # Get the actual object before passing it
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
