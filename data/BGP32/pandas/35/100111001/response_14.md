### Analyzing the Bug

The bug occurs in the `_engine` function in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file. The function attempts to create a weak reference to the `self` object and then pass it to `_engine_type` method along with the length of `self`. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` related to a `NoneType` object not having the attribute `view`.

### Issues in the Buggy Function

1. The function creates a weak reference to `self`, but it doesn't correctly handle it when passed to `_engine_type`.
2. The return statement relies on `self._engine_type` to create an engine, but it appears that this operation fails.
3. The type or value of the engine instance is not as expected, resulting in an `AttributeError`.

### Bug Cause

The `weakref.ref(self)` creates a weak reference object that does not behave like the original object but instead allows access to it if the original object is still alive. This difference causes an issue when passed to `_engine_type`, resulting in the `AttributeError`.

### Suggested Fix

To handle the weak reference correctly, we can modify the `_engine` function to retrieve the original object from the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`. Additionally, we need to ensure that `_engine_type` operation behaves as expected to avoid the `AttributeError`.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    period = weak_period()
    
    if period is not None:
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return None
```

In this corrected version, we first retrieve the original object from the weak reference and then check if it is not `None` before proceeding with creating the engine. This adjustment should address the weak reference issue and prevent the `AttributeError`.
