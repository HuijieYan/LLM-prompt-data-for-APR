The bug in the `_engine` function seems to be related to the creation of a weak reference to `self` and then passing that weak reference to `_engine_type`. The error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` instance is returning a `NoneType` object when trying to access `view("i8")`.

Potential Error:
- The weak reference created to `self` might be causing issues in the `_engine_type` creation process.

Cause of the Bug:
- The weak reference to `self` might be getting lost or not properly initialized in the context of the `_engine_type` constructor.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To address the issue of the `NoneType` object, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly handled and utilized within the `_engine_type` constructor.

Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `period()` is called to retrieve the actual reference from the weak reference object before passing it to `_engine_type`. This modification ensures that a valid reference to `self` is used in the construction of the `_engine_type` object.
