### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`, but it seems to be passing the weak reference to `_engine_type` incorrectly, leading to an `AttributeError` in the failing test.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` from a list of `PeriodIndex` objects and then tries to check if the levels are monotonic. This test fails due to an `AttributeError` related to 'NoneType' object.

The error message and the runtime values indicate that the issue lies within the `_engine` function, particularly the `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))` line, where the weak reference `period` may not be correctly handled.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to correctly pass the weak reference `period` to `_engine_type`. It seems that the `period` variable should be unwrapped before being passed to `_engine_type`. We should also ensure that the reference is correctly maintained to avoid the 'NoneType' object AttributeError.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))  # Unwrap the weak reference 'period' before passing to _engine_type
```

By making this change, we ensure that the weak reference is correctly unwrapped before being passed to the `_engine_type`, which should resolve the `AttributeError` and allow the failing test to pass.
