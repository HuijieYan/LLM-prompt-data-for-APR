The buggy function `_engine` is causing an issue that leads to an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` when the `is_monotonic` method is called on the engine. This error indicates that the engine instance is `None` when the `is_monotonic_increasing` method is invoked.

The root cause of this issue is that the `period` object in the `_engine` function is created using `weakref.ref(self)`, which returns a weak reference of the `self` object. When the weak reference is used to create the engine instance `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, it is becoming `None` due to the weak reference mechanism.

To fix this bug, the `ref()` method should be dereferenced to get the original `self` object before passing it to the `_engine_type()` constructor.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = self  # Dereference the weak reference to get the original self object
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By directly assigning `self` to `period` without using `weakref.ref()`, the original `self` object is passed to `_engine_type()`, resolving the issue with the weak reference causing `NoneType` error.
