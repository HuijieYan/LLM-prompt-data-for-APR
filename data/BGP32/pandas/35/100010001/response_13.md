### Analysis:
- The error message is `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.
- The failing test is checking whether the levels in `idx2` are all monotonic.
- The error occurs when trying to retrieve the values from the `_engine` attribute of the index which is returning a `NoneType`.

### Bugs:
1. In the `_engine` function, `weakref.ref(self)` is not preserving the weak reference properly.
2. As a result, `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` is returning `None` instead of the expected engine object.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
Since the issue lies in the weak reference creation, we need to ensure that `weakref.ref(self)` successfully creates a weak reference to `self` and returns the appropriate engine object when accessing `_engine`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))

# Ensure that we call the weak reference to get the actual object. 
# weakref.ref(self)() returns the actual referenced object.
```

With the corrected version above, the weak reference is properly created, and the `_engine` function should now return the correct engine object instead of `None`.
