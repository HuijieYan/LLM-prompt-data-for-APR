The bug in the provided function `_engine` is likely related to the way the weak reference `period` is being created and used. The error message indicates an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, which suggests that the `_engine_type` is returning `None` instead of the expected engine object.

The cause of the bug appears to be the weak reference creation using `weakref.ref(self)` where `self` is the object being referenced. The problem is that the weak reference might return `None` when accessed, leading to the `AttributeError` when trying to call a method on a `NoneType` object.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to ensure that the weak reference `period` is properly handled and does not result in `None` being returned. One way to do this is by storing the result of `weakref.ref(self)` in a variable and checking if it returns `None` before using it to create the engine object.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    period_obj = period()
    
    if period_obj is not None:
        return self._engine_type(period_obj, len(self))
    else:
        raise ValueError("Weak reference to self is None.")
```

In this corrected version, we first retrieve the object from the weak reference using `period()` and store it in `period_obj`. Then, we check if `period_obj` is not `None` before using it to create the engine object. If `None` is returned by the weak reference, we raise a `ValueError` to indicate that the weak reference to `self` is `None`.

By adding this check, we ensure that the engine object is created properly without running into the `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` issue. This fix should address the bug in the `_engine` function.
