### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates an AttributeError with the message `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.
2. The error occurs in the function `is_monotonic_increasing` in the class `IndexEngine`.
3. The function `is_monotonic_increasing` calls `self._engine.is_monotonic_increasing`, which suggests an issue with the `_engine` property.
4. The `_engine` property in the buggy function `_engine(self)` is returning an instance of `PeriodEngine` which may not be correctly handling weak references.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the weak reference creation in the `_engine` function. The weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` might not be preserving the reference to the object `self` correctly, leading to a `NoneType` return value when accessed later in the code.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we should modify the `_engine` function to properly create a weak reference to `self` and ensure that it maintains a strong reference for the object to avoid the `NoneType` error.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we create a weak reference that can act as a proxy for the original object and maintain a strong reference to `self` during the `_engine_type` call. This should fix the issue related to the `NoneType` error.
