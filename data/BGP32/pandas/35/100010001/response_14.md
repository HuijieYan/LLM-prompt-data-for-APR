### Analyzing the buggy function and the error message:

The buggy function is `_engine(self)` which is using `weakref.ref()` to create a weak reference to `self`, and then passing this weak reference to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`. The purpose of creating a weak reference is to avoid reference cycles and potential memory leaks.

The error message is occurring when trying to access the attribute `view` on a `NoneType` object, indicating that the `_engine` is returning `None` instead of the expected engine object.

### Identifying potential error locations:

The bug could be in the way the weak reference is created using `weakref.ref(self)`, or in the way the `_engine_type` function is being called with this weak reference. If the weak reference is not properly representing the original object `self`, it may lead to `None` being returned.

### Cause of the bug:

The bug is likely caused by the weak reference created using `weakref.ref(self)` not correctly capturing the object `self`. This results in `_engine` returning `None` instead of the actual engine object, leading to the AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference captures the object `self` properly so that when `_engine` is called, it returns the actual engine object rather than `None`.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Using weakref.proxy() instead of weakref.ref() to create weak reference
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    # Check if period is still alive, if not, return None
    if period is None:
        return None
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we ensure that the weak reference reflects the actual object `self`. Additionally, we add a check to see if the weak reference is still alive before returning the engine object, to handle cases where `self` may have been deleted and the weak reference is no longer valid.
