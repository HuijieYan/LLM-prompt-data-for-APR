### Analysis:
The error message indicates that there is an `AttributeError` due to a `NoneType` object in the `view` method call. This error is triggered when trying to access `self._engine` in the `is_monotonic_increasing` method.
The `view` method is trying to access an attribute of a `NoneType` object, which means that `self._engine` is returning `None`.

### Bug Cause:
The `_engine` method is returning `None`. Since `_engine` is a `@cache_readonly` method, it might not be initialized properly to return the correct value.

### Fix Strategy:
Check the way `_engine` method is implemented. Make sure the `self._engine_type` is correctly instantiated and returned.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        # Handle the case where _engine_type returned None
        raise ValueError("_engine_type returned None")
    return engine
``` 

This corrected version ensures that if the `_engine_type` returns `None`, it will raise an error to indicate the issue. This should prevent the `AttributeError` caused by a `NoneType` object in the subsequent calls.
