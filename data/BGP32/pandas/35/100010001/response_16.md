**Analysis:**
- The error message indicates an 'AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view''.
- The bug is likely in the `_engine` function where a period is being assigned a weak reference.
- The weak reference is not being properly utilized in the `_engine_type` function call.

**Cause of the Bug:**
- The weak reference `period` is not being used correctly in passing it to the `_engine_type` function.
- When creating a weak reference, the reference should be dereferenced appropriately to avoid `NoneType` object errors.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**
- Use `period()` to dereference the weak reference before passing it to the `_engine_type` function.
- Ensure that the weak reference is properly accessed in the `_engine_type` function.

**Corrected Version of the Function:**
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use `period()` to dereference the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By modifying the code to use `weakref.ref(self)()` to dereference the weak reference, the corrected version of the function should avoid the `NoneType` object error.
