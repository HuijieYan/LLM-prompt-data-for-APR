## Analysis:
1. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` related to a `NoneType` object not having the attribute `view`.
2. The buggy function `_engine` is a `@cache_readonly` decorator that returns an object of type `_engine_type`. This object is created using a weak reference to `self`.
3. The error occurs when trying to access an attribute (`view`) on the object returned by `_engine_type`.
4. The bug is likely caused by the weak reference (`period = weakref.ref(self)`) not properly referencing the object `self`, leading to `NoneType` errors.
5. To fix the bug, we should ensure that the weak reference is correctly capturing and returning the referenced object.


## Fix:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we use `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference. This ensures that the referenced object is still accessible and does not lead to `NoneType` errors.
