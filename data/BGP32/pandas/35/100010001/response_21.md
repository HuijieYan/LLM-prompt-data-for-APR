### Analysis:
- The error message indicates that there is an `AttributeError` because `self._engine` is returning a `NoneType` object, which does not have the `view` attribute.
- The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to avoid a reference cycle, but there seems to be an issue with how it's being used.

### Bug Explanation:
- The bug seems to stem from the fact that `weakref.ref(self)` is used incorrectly. `weakref.ref()` returns a weak reference object, not the actual object itself. When `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` is called, it seems like `period` is not referencing the original object `self` correctly, which leads to `self._engine` returning `None`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix this bug, we need to make sure that we are correctly referencing the original object `self` using weak references. This can be achieved by properly dereferencing the weak reference object before using it.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `period()` is called to dereference the weak reference object and retrieve the original `self` object before passing it to `_engine_type`. This should fix the issue with `self._engine` returning `None` and resolve the `AttributeError` seen in the failing test.
