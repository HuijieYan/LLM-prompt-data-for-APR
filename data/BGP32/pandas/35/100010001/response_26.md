### Analysis:
The error message `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` is indicating that the `_engine` method is returning `None` instead of the expected object, leading to the attribute error.

### Potential Error Location:
The issue is likely with how the `period` variable is being used to create the `_engine` object. The `weakref.ref(self)` call seems to be incorrect.

### Cause of the Bug:
The `weakref.ref(self)` call is creating a weak reference to the `self` object but not actually retrieving the target object from the weak reference, resulting in `None` being returned by `_engine` method.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to explicitly retrieve the target object from the weak reference created by `weakref.ref(self)` before passing it to `_engine_type` method.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.ref(self)()` we are retrieving the actual object from the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type` method. This should resolve the bug and prevent the `NoneType` error.
