### Analysis:
1. The error is occurring in the `is_monotonic_increasing` method of the index engine class.
2. The `_engine` function in the buggy code snippet returns an instance of `_engine_type` with a weak reference to `self`, which may cause issues with attribute access.
3. The error message indicates that the `super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter()` call is returning a `NoneType` object, leading to the AttributeError.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine` function correctly creates an instance of `_engine_type` without causing weak reference-related issues.

### Fix:
We can modify the `_engine` function to maintain a strong reference to `self` during the creation of `_engine_type` instance. The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Pass a strong reference to self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

This correction ensures that the weak reference issue is resolved, and a strong reference to `self` is passed to `_engine_type`. This change should prevent the `NoneType` error and allow the test to pass successfully.
