### Analysis:
- The error message is indicating an `AttributeError`, specifically `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.
- The buggy function involves a weak reference `weakref.ref(self)` being assigned to `period` which is then passed to `_engine_type`, leading to the error.
- The `NoneType` error suggests that the `_engine_type` method is not receiving the `weakref` object as intended, resulting in a `NoneType` object error.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by assigning a weak reference `weakref.ref(self)` to `period` but not properly accessing the reference object when using it in `_engine_type`, leading to a `NoneType` object being passed causing the `AttributeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Instead of just assigning the weak reference `weakref.ref(self)` to `period`, we should dereference the weak reference object properly to pass the actual object to the `_engine_type` method.
- Ensure that the dereferenced object is correctly handled by `_engine_type` to prevent the `NoneType` error.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass the dereferenced weakref object to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

### Correction Rationale:
- In the corrected version, `period = weakref.ref(self)()` is used to dereference the weak reference directly during assignment.
- This change ensures that the actual object is passed to `_engine_type`, preventing the `NoneType` error and resolving the bug in the function.
