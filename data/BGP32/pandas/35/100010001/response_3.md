### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError related to a 'NoneType' object in the `PeriodEngine` class.
2. The `_engine` function in the buggy code is using a weak reference to create a weak reference to `self`, which can lead to the creation of a `weakref.ref` object.
3. The `_engine` function returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, where `self._engine_type` is expected to be an instance of the `PeriodEngine` class. The error message suggests that `self._engine_type` may be `None`, resulting in the AttributeError.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `self._engine_type` is correctly assigned before calling the `_engine` function.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Make sure that `self._engine_type` is properly initialized and assigned to an instance of `PeriodEngine` before calling the `_engine` function.
2. The initialization should set `self._engine_type` to a valid instance and prevent it from being `None`.
3. To address this, we can use lazy initialization to set `self._engine_type` when it is first accessed.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    try:
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    except AttributeError:
        self._engine_type = PeriodEngine
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we catch the AttributeError and set `self._engine_type` to `PeriodEngine` if it was not properly initialized. This ensures that `_engine` function always has a valid `self._engine_type` instance.
