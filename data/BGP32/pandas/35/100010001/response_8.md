### Analysis:
- The error message is pointing to an `AttributeError` in the `return super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter().view("i8")` line of the code.
- The error is related to the `_engine` method of the `PeriodEngine` class.
- The function `_engine` is a cached readonly function and is supposed to return an instance of `_engine_type`.
- The error message indicates that the `_engine` method might be returning `None`, causing the `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view("i8")` method on `None`.

### Bug Cause:
- In the buggy function `_engine`, the weak reference `period` is created with `weakref.ref(self)`, but its purpose is not utilized afterwards.
- The `_engine_type` method is called with `period` and `len(self)` as arguments, but since `period` is a weak reference, it might not be correctly passed to `_engine_type`.
- This could result in `_engine_type` receiving `None` instead of an actual reference to the object.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Instead of passing a weak reference object `period` to `_engine_type`, it's better to pass a direct reference to the object `self`.
- This can be achieved by modifying the `_engine` method to return an instance of `_engine_type` by directly passing `self`.

### Updated Code:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
``` 

With this change, the function now correctly passes a direct reference to `self` to `_engine_type`, which should resolve the `AttributeError` causing the bug.
