### Analysis:
- The error message points to an `AttributeError` on 'NoneType' object when attempting to access the 'view' attribute.
- The failing test is related to the `is_monotonic` property of the index, which eventually accesses the `_engine` property.
- The `_engine` property is defined as a `cache_readonly` method in the buggy function.
- The function creates a weak reference to `self` and uses it to pass to `_engine_type`.
- The current implementation of `_engine` might be returning `None`, leading to the AttributeError.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the fact that the `_engine` method is not correctly setting and returning the engine type. It returns `None` instead of the expected engine type instance.

### Fix Strategy:
- Ensure that `_engine` method correctly initializes and returns the engine type instance.
- Check if the weak reference is properly handled and the engine type instance is properly created and returned.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

### Explanation of Fix:
- In the corrected version, `period()` is called to retrieve the referenced object, which should be `self`.
- This ensures that the engine type instance is properly created using the `self` reference and returned from the `_engine` method.
