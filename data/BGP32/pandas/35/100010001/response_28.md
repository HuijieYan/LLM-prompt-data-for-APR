### Analysis:
The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `PeriodEngine` class, specifically with the `vgetter()` method returning a `NoneType` which does not have the `view` attribute. This error occurs when trying to access the `view` attribute in the `is_monotonic_increasing` method of the index engine.

### Potential Error Location:
The bug is likely related to the `_engine` method in the `period.py` file where a `weakref` to `self` is being passed to the `_engine_type` method. This could lead to `self` becoming `None` somewhere in the process.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by passing a weak reference to `self` in the `_engine` function. Since weak references can become `None` when the original object is deleted, it can lead to unexpected behavior when trying to access attributes or methods of the original object.

### Fixing Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the reference to `self` remains valid throughout the `_engine` function. One approach could be to create a strong reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type` to prevent it from being deleted.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a strong reference to self
    period = self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By maintaining a strong reference to `self` instead of a weak reference, we ensure that `self` remains valid throughout the `_engine` function and prevent it from being deleted unexpectedly, potentially resolving the issue causing the `NoneType` error.
