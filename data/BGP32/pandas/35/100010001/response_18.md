### Analysis:
- The error message indicates an AttributeError related to a 'NoneType' object that is trying to call the 'view' method.
- The bug is located within the `_engine` method defined in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file.
- When the `_engine` method is called, it returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, but the `period` variable is incorrectly assigned using `weakref.ref(self)` which creates a weak reference to `self`. This weak reference is causing the `NoneType` object error when trying to access its attributes.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by using `weakref.ref()` to create a weak reference to `self` in the `_engine` method, which leads to a 'NoneType' object error when trying to access attributes or methods of the weak reference.

### Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, the weak reference should be dereferenced properly before accessing its attributes or methods. The weak reference needs to be called to retrieve the original object before passing it to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By changing the assignment from `period = weakref.ref(self)` to `period = self` in the `_engine` method, we maintain a direct reference to `self` rather than a weak reference. This modification should fix the bug by preventing the 'NoneType' object error when accessing attributes or methods.
