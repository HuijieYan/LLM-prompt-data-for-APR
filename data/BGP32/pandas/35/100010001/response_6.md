### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates an AttributeError related to 'NoneType' object when attempting to access the 'view' attribute.
2. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`, but it is not handling the weak reference properly.
3. The `weakref.ref` function does not return the `self` reference directly but creates a callable proxy object that holds a weak reference to `self`. When trying to access attributes directly on this proxy object, it will return `None`, leading to the 'NoneType' error.
4. To fix this bug, we need to modify how the weak reference is handled in the `_engine` function to properly access the referenced object.

### Fix:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

### Explanation:
- In the fixed version, `period()` is used to retrieve the actual object referenced by the weak reference created by `weakref.ref(self)`. By calling `period()`, it returns the original `self` object, resolving the issue of accessing attributes on the weak reference proxy object.
- This modification ensures that the correct reference to the actual object is passed to `_engine_type` without causing the 'NoneType' error, resolving the AttributeError.
