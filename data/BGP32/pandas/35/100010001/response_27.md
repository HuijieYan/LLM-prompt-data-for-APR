1. Analyzing the buggy function:
   - The buggy function is a `@cache_readonly` decorator for the `_engine` method in the `PeriodIndex` class. This method is supposed to return a new instance of a specific engine type with a weak reference to the calling index.
   - The error message occurs when calling the `is_monotonic` method on the levels of the MultiIndex.

2. Potential error locations within the buggy function:
   - The use of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` might be causing the issue when creating the engine instance.

3. Cause of the bug:
   - The error message indicates 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view', which means that the `_engine` method returned a `None` object instead of the expected engine instance. This leads to subsequent attribute errors when trying to access methods on the `None` object.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
   - The issue likely arises from the weak reference implementation in the `_engine` method. To fix this, ensure that the engine instance is correctly created and returned when using weak referencing.

5. Corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    if period:
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        return None
```

In the corrected version, `weakref.ref(self)()` creates a strong reference to `self` from the weak reference, which allows the `_engine_type` method to properly access and construct the engine instance. Additionally, it checks if the `period` object is not None before creating the engine.
