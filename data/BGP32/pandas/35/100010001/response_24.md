### Analysis:
The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `PeriodEngine` object being accessed from `self._engine`. The `PeriodEngine` object seems to be returning a `NoneType` which does not have the `view` attribute, leading to the `AttributeError`.

### Potential Error Location:
The issue is likely within the `_engine` function itself where the `PeriodEngine` object is being returned.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the fact that the weak reference to `self` is being assigned to the `period` variable, but the weak reference is not being properly maintained. As a result, the weak reference may become invalid and return `None`, causing the AttributeError when trying to access `view`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to properly maintain the weak reference to `self` within the `_engine` function so that it does not become invalid. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference as an attribute of the object, which ensures that the reference remains valid as long as the object itself exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

By creating an attribute `_period_weakref` to store the weak reference to `self`, we ensure that the reference remains valid as long as the object exists. This should fix the issue of returning `NoneType` and resolve the AttributeError.
