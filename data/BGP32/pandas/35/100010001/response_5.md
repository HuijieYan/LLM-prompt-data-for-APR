### Analysis:
- The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError in the code related to 'NoneType' object not having the 'view' attribute.
- The failing test is related to the `is_monotonic` property of an index, which is calling `is_monotonic_increasing` that in turn tries to access `self._engine` and perform an operation on it.
- The buggy function `_engine` returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, suggesting that the `self._engine` might be returning `None` in some cases causing the AttributeError.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the `_engine` function returning `None` instead of the expected engine object, which in turn causes the `is_monotonic_increasing` property check to fail due to calling a method on a `NoneType` object.

### Fix Strategy:
- Update the `_engine` function to ensure that it always returns a valid engine object, avoiding it to return `None`.
- Modify the code logic to correctly initialize and return the engine object.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_instance = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    if engine_instance is None:
        # Create a valid engine instance if it is None
        engine_instance = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    return engine_instance
```

With this correction, the `_engine` function will ensure that it returns a valid engine instance, preventing the AttributeError encountered in the failing test.
