### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates an AttributeError related to 'NoneType' object in the line `return super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter().view("i8")`.
2. The `NoneType` error suggests that the `_engine` method is returning `None` instead of an instance of `PeriodEngine`.
3. The `weakref` usage in the `_engine` method is incorrect and may be causing the return of `None`.
4. The correct approach is to properly use `weakref` to prevent reference cycles without causing the `_engine` method to return `None`.

### Bug Cause:
The `weakref` is not being used correctly to create a weak reference to `self`, causing the `_engine` method to return `None` instead of an instance of `PeriodEngine`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Properly create a weak reference to `self` using `weakref.proxy()` instead of `weakref.ref()`.
2. Ensure that the weak reference doesn't prevent the creation of the `PeriodEngine` instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period_proxy = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_proxy, len(self))
```
