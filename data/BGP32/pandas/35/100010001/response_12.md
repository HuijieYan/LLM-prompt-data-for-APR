### Analysis:
- The error message indicates that `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, which implies that the `PeriodEngine` object is not being properly initialized in the `_engine` function.
- The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, which might not be creating a valid reference to the object in this case.
- When `weakref.ref(self)` is not properly referencing the object, it leads to `NoneType` object errors when trying to access attributes or methods on that object.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the weak reference creation using `weakref.ref(self)` not correctly storing the reference to `self`, leading to a `NoneType` object for the `PeriodEngine`.

### Fix Strategy:
- Instead of using weak references, directly pass `self` (the period object) to `_engine_type` for proper initialization of the `PeriodEngine`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))  # Passing self directly to _engine_type
``` 

By directly passing `self` to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the `PeriodEngine` is correctly initialized with the actual object, fixing the weak reference issue and resolving the `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error.
