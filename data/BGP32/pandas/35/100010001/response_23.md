### Analysis:
1. The error message suggests that there is an AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view' in the `is_monotonic_increasing` method.
2. The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` which creates a weak reference to the `self` object, but it is not being used correctly when trying to instantiate `self._engine_type`.
3. The error occurs because the weak reference `period` is being passed to `_engine_type` instead of the the actual `self` object.
4. The strategy to fix the bug is to dereference the weak reference `period` to get the actual object before passing it to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Dereference the weak reference to get the actual object
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By using `period = weakref.ref(self)()`, we are dereferencing the weak reference `period` to obtain the actual object referenced by the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`. This should resolve the AttributeError issue reported in the failing test.
