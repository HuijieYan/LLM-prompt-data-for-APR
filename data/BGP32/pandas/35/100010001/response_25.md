### Analysis:
- The error message indicates that there is an `AttributeError` occurring in the `_do_monotonic_check` method of the `IndexEngine` class.
- The bug is likely related to the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class, where a weak reference is being passed to `_engine_type`.
- The error suggests that a `NoneType` object is being accessed for the `view` attribute, likely due to an issue with the return value of `_engine_type`.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is causing `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` to return `None`, resulting in the `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute on a `NoneType` object.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- The `_engine` method should return a valid `_engine_type` object instead of `None`. 
- One way to achieve this is to pass `self` directly to `_engine_type` without using a weak reference.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Assume this is the corrected version of the function in 'pandas/core/indexes/period.py'

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By passing `self` directly to `_engine_type`, we ensure that a valid instance of the engine is created and returned, fixing the bug that was causing `NoneType` attribute errors.
