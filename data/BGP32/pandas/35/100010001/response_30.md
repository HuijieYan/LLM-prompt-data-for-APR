### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` object is returning a `NoneType` instead of the expected object when trying to access the `view` attribute.

### Error Location:
The issue lies in the `_engine` method of the `PeriodEngine` where it is returning `None` unexpectedly.

### Bug Cause:
The `_engine` method is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` (PeriodEngine object) but not properly accessing the referenced object afterwards. This leads to `None` being returned instead of the actual `PeriodEngine` object which causes the AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to correctly access the referenced object from the weak reference created using `weakref.ref`. We should dereference the weak reference to access the actual object it refers to before returning it.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the correct file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected _engine method
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return period()._engine_type(self, len(self))
``` 

Now, with the corrected version of the `_engine` method, the weakly referenced `self` object is dereferenced using `period()` before being passed to `_engine_type`, ensuring that the actual `self` object is returned without being `None`. This fix should resolve the `AttributeError` during attribute access on `NoneType`.
