### Analysis:
1. The error message is pointing to the line `return super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter().view("i8")` within the `_do_monotonic_check` method in the `pandas/_libs/index.pyx` file.
2. The bug is related to accessing an attribute (`view`) on a `NoneType` object.
3. The bug is likely due to the `_engine` function returning `None`, which is causing the subsequent error when trying to access the `view` attribute.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to correctly return the engine instance.

### Fix:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weak_period, len(self))()

```

By modifying the return statement to `(weak_period, len(self))()`, we are creating an instance of the engine type and returning it instead of returning a weakref object. This should fix the bug.
