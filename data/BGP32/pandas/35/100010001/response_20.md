### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine(self)` is attempting to create a weak reference to the `self` object and pass it to the `_engine_type` method. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the return value of the `PeriodEngine` class's `vgetter` method, which results in a `NoneType` object being accessed.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The `weakref.ref()` method is not properly creating a weak reference.
2. The `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` method is returning `None`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by the weak reference not being created correctly or the return value of `_engine_type` method not being handled properly, resulting in a `NoneType` object being returned.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that a valid weak reference is created correctly.
2. Modify the implementation of the `_engine` function to handle the case where `_engine_type()` may return `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self properly
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    
    # Check if the weak reference exists before passing to _engine_type
    if period is not None:
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        raise ValueError("Weak reference to self is not valid")
```

In the corrected version, we first attempt to create a weak reference properly using `weakref.ref(self)()`, and then check if the weak reference is valid before passing it to `_engine_type`. If the weak reference is `None`, we raise a `ValueError` to indicate that the weak reference is not valid.

This correction should address the issue of the `NoneType` object being accessed and provide a more robust way to handle the weak reference creation.
