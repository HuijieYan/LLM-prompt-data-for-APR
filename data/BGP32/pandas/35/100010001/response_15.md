### Analysis:
1. The `_engine` function is annotated with `@cache_readonly`.
2. The function creates a weak reference to `self` named `period`.
3. The function then returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.
4. The error message points to an issue with the function `is_monotonic_increasing` that uses the `_engine` property.

### Potential Error:
The bug might be due to the `_engine` property not being set correctly, resulting in a `NoneType` object being returned.

### Bug Cause:
The `_engine` property is not being set properly, or the weak reference `period` is not being utilized correctly during the creation of the `_engine` property.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the `_engine` property is set correctly with the weak reference `period`.
2. Check if the weak reference `period` is being accessed or utilized in the context where `_engine` is used.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
    return engine
``` 

By using `period()` instead of just `period`, we are properly accessing the original object from the weak reference. This should resolve the issue with the `NoneType` object being returned.
