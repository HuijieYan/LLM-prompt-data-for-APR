### Analysis:
- The error message points to an `AttributeError` on line `return super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter().view("i8")`.
- The buggy function `_engine` is trying to create an instance of `_engine_type` using a weak reference of `self`, but it seems to be causing issues when trying to access certain attributes or methods within the `_engine_type` class.

### Bugs:
1. Creating a weak reference using `weakref.ref(self)` might not be preserving the necessary attributes or methods required by the `_engine_type` class.
2. This can lead to a situation where the `_engine_type` class is unable to access certain attributes or methods, causing the `AttributeError`.

### Fix Strategy:
- Instead of using a weak reference, directly pass `self` to the `_engine_type` class.
- Ensure that the `_engine_type` class is able to access all necessary attributes and methods from the `self` object without any issues.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
