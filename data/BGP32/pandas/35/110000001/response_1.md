The bug in the `_engine` function lies in the way it creates a weak reference to `self`. In the current implementation, `weakref.ref(self)` creates a weak reference to the object `self`, but it does not maintain a reference to `self` itself. Therefore, when `period` is returned and passed to `_engine_type`, it may end up being garbage collected before it is used, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the way the weak reference is created. We can store the weak reference in a class attribute to maintain a reference to `self` and ensure that it is not garbage collected prematurely.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a weak reference to self in a class attribute to avoid premature garbage collection
    self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference in the `_period_ref` class attribute, we ensure that `self` is maintained for as long as `_engine` function is being used, preventing any unexpected behavior due to premature garbage collection.
