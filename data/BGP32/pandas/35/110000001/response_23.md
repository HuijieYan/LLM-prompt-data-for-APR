### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` decorator that is meant to return an instance of `_engine_type` based on the `PeriodIndex` object.
- The function uses `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object to avoid reference cycles.

### Identified Error:
The bug in the function `_engine` is that it tries to pass the weak reference `period` to `_engine_type`, but it should actually pass the actual `PeriodIndex` object.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by passing the weak reference `period` to `_engine_type` instead of the `PeriodIndex` object itself. This results in `_engine_type` not getting the actual object it needs to operate on.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should pass the actual `PeriodIndex` object instead of the weak reference to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Pass the actual self object, not a weak reference
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
