The bug in the provided function is that `weakref.ref(self)` is called without storing the reference as an instance variable. This leads to the weak reference becoming a local variable within the scope of the `_engine` function, which will be garbage collected once the function finishes execution. 

To fix this bug, the weak reference should be stored as an instance variable so that the reference is maintained as long as the object exists.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Store the weak reference to self as an instance variable
        self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
        
        return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference as `self._period_weakref`, we ensure that the reference to `self` is maintained as long as the `PeriodIndex` object exists, preventing premature garbage collection.
