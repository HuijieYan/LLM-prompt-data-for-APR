The bug in the provided function `_engine` is the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref`. The `weakref.ref` function returns a weak reference to the object, and when the `_engine` method tries to access the weak reference object, it does not actually access the original object.

To fix this bug, we should modify the implementation of `_engine` to use `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref` so that it returns a proxy object that can be used to access the original object.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, the `_engine` function will return a proxy object that allows access to the original `self` object without creating a strong reference cycle. This will fix the bug in the function.
