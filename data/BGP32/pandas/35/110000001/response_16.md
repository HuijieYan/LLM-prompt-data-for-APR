Potential errors in the buggy function:
1. The `weakref.ref` function is used incorrectly, it needs to be assigned to a variable in order to be used properly.
2. It seems like the `_engine_type` method is expecting a different type of argument than what it's getting from `weakref.ref(self)`.

Cause of the bug:
The bug in the function `_engine` is caused by using `weakref.ref(self)` directly as an argument to `_engine_type`. The `_engine_type` method is likely expecting a different type of argument, not a weak reference.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Assign the weak reference to a variable.
2. Pass the actual object instead of the weak reference to `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
