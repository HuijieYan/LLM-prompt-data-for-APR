## Analysis:
- The buggy function `_engine` is a cached read-only property within the `PeriodIndex` class.
- The purpose of this function is to create a weak reference to the `self` object (an instance of `PeriodIndex`) and then pass this weak reference along with the length of the object to `_engine_type` method.
- The use of `weakref.ref(self)` creates a weak reference to the `self` object, which is then used to avoid reference cycles.
- The potential error lies in the fact that `weakref.ref(self)` is not being correctly utilized in the subsequent call to `_engine_type`.

## Cause of the Bug:
- The bug stems from passing the weak reference object `period` to the `_engine_type` method. This approach is incorrect as `_engine_type` will receive the weak reference object instead of the original `self` object, which could cause issues during further processing.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Instead of passing the weak reference object (`period`) to the `_engine_type` method, we should pass the original `self` object.
- To achieve this, we need to access the original object from the weak reference using the `.()()` method, which will return the original `self` object.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Access the original object from the weak reference using .()()
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By making this modification, we ensure that the original `self` object is passed to the `_engine_type` method, allowing it to perform operations correctly without issues related to weak references.
