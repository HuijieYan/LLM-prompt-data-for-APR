## Analysis:
1. The function `_engine` is a method of the `PeriodIndex` class.
2. The function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object.
3. The purpose of using a weak reference is to avoid circular references that prevent objects from being garbage collected.
4. The bug in the function is that it is missing a `self` reference when calling `_engine_type`, which should be passed as `self` instead of `period`.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug in the function occurs because the `self` reference is not correctly passed to `_engine_type`. This results in a potential issue with the object's lifecycle management and can lead to memory leaks or unexpected behavior.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to pass `self` as an argument to the `_engine_type` method instead of the weak reference `period`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
