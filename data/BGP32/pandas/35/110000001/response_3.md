The bug in the `_engine` function lies in the fact that it is trying to create a weak reference to `self`, the instance of the `PeriodIndex` class. However, the usage of `weakref.ref(self)` is incorrect, as it is not properly storing the weak reference to `self`. 

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to correctly create a weak reference to `self` and then pass this weak reference to `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self
    weak_self = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weak_self, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we create a weak reference to `self` using `weakref.ref(self)` and store it in `weak_self`. Then, we pass `weak_self` to `_engine_type` for further processing, ensuring that a reference cycle is avoided.

By making this simple modification, we fix the buggy function and ensure that it works correctly within the `PeriodIndex` class.
