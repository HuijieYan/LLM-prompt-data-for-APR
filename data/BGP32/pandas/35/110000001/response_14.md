## Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self` to avoid reference cycles. However, the issue is in the way the weak reference is being passed to `_engine_type`. The weak reference should be dereferenced using `period()` before being passed to `_engine_type`.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by passing a weak reference object directly to `_engine_type` instead of dereferencing it first. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors when trying to use the weak reference object.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Dereference the weak reference object `period` using `period()` method before passing it to `_engine_type`.
2. Update the `_engine` function to return the result of `_engine_type` using the dereferenced weak reference object.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The correction for the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
