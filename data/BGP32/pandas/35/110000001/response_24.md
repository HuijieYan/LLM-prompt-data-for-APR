## Analysis:
1. The buggy function appears to be trying to create a weak reference to the `self` object (an instance of `PeriodIndex`) and pass it to `_engine_type`.
2. The purpose of using a weak reference is to avoid creating a reference cycle that might prevent the object from being garbage collected when it is no longer needed.
3. The bug seems to be that the `weakref.ref(self)` line is not correctly being used in this context, leading to an error when trying to create the `_engine` instance.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the weak reference is created and passed to `_engine_type`.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the function `_engine` is caused by incorrect usage of `weakref.ref(self)`. This line returns a weak reference object to `self`, which is not directly usable as an argument to `_engine_type`.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the weak reference is passed to `_engine_type`. We can directly pass `self` to `_engine_type` without using `weakref` as the inheritance hierarchy of Pandas guarantees that `self` will not create a reference cycle.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
