The bug in the `_engine` function is that it is trying to pass `weakref.ref(self)` directly to the `_engine_type` constructor as a parameter. The correct approach is to use `period()` to retrieve the referenced object from the weak reference before passing it to the constructor of `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By using `period()` to dereference the weak reference, we ensure that the actual object referenced by the weak reference is passed to the constructor of `_engine_type`.

This fix addresses the bug by correctly retrieving the object from the weak reference before passing it to the constructor.
