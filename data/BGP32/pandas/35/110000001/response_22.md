## Analysis:
- The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is the `PeriodIndex` object.
- The purpose of using a weak reference is to prevent a reference cycle and potential memory leaks when creating objects that reference each other.
- However, the bug lies in the way the `weakref.ref(self)` is being used.

## Bug Cause:
- The `weakref.ref(self)` is not being called properly with parentheses to create a weak reference object.
- As a result, the `period` variable is being incorrectly assigned the weak reference function itself rather than the weak reference object.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to properly call `weakref.ref(self)` with parentheses to create a weak reference object.
- This way, the `period` variable will hold a reference to the `PeriodIndex` object with weak referencing enabled.

## Corrected Version:
```python
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)()
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

In the corrected version, `weakref.ref(self)()` is used to create a weak reference object and then immediately call it to obtain the actual weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object.
