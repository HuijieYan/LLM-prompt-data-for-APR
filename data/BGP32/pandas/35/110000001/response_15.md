## Analysis:
- The buggy function `_engine` is a cached readonly property defined within the `PeriodIndex` class.
- It uses `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance and then passes this weak reference to `_engine_type` along with the length of the instance.
- The intention seems to be to avoid creating a strong reference cycle, possibly for memory management reasons.
- However, the bug lies in the fact that the weak reference `period` is not being dereferenced properly before passing it to `_engine_type`.

## Potential Error Location:
The potential error lies in the usage of `period` within the return statement. Since `period` is a weak reference, it needs to be dereferenced using `.()` or `.referent` before passing it to `_engine_type`.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises because the weak reference `period` is being passed directly to `_engine_type`, which may lead to unexpected behavior or errors due to the weak reference not being dereferenced properly.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to dereference the weak reference `period` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This can be done by calling `period()` or `period.referent` to get the actual reference object.

## Corrected Version:
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Dereference the weak reference before passing to _engine_type
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `period()` is called to dereference the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`. This ensures that the actual reference object is used and helps in avoiding any unexpected behavior due to weak referencing.
