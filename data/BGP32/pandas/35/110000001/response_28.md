### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is trying to create a weak reference to the `self` object in order to avoid a reference cycle. However, the weak reference is not being passed correctly to `_engine_type`, which is the intended target function that receives the weak reference.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not correctly passing the weak reference `period` to `_engine_type`. The `self` object should be accessed through the weak reference when calling `_engine_type`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to use the weak reference `period` to access the `self` object when calling `_engine_type`. 

### Corrected Version:
```python
    # Fixed version of the _engine function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

In the corrected version, we are using `period()` to get the actual object referred to by the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`. This ensures that the weak reference is correctly utilized to access the `self` object.
