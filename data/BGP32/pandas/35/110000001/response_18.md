The buggy function `_engine` has an issue with the weak reference usage. The weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` is not properly capturing the object it is referencing, causing it to be garbage collected prematurely.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the weak reference usage by storing a strong reference to `self` in a local variable before creating the weak reference. This will ensure that the object `self` is not garbage collected before the `_engine_type` method is called.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a strong reference to self before creating the weak reference
    strong_self = self
    # Pass a weakref of strong_self to _engine_type to avoid a reference cycle
    period = weakref.ref(strong_self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By storing a strong reference to `self` before creating the weak reference, we ensure that the object `self` is not garbage collected prematurely, fixing the bug in the `_engine` function.
