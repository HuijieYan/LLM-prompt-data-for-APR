The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is attempting to create a weak reference to itself (`self`) and then pass that weak reference to `_engine_type` to create the engine. However, there are a couple of issues in the implementation that need to be corrected.

1. The usage of `weakref.ref(self)` is incorrect. `weakref.ref()` returns a weak reference object which needs to be called to retrieve the original object. So, it should be assigned as `period = weakref.ref(self)()`.

2. The call to `_engine_type` should use the weak reference `period` instead of `self`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)()
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

After making these corrections, the bug in the implementation should be fixed, and the `_engine` function should work correctly.
