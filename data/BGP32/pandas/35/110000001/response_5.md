The bug in the provided function `_engine` arises because the weak reference `period` is being created and stored within the function, but it is not being utilized correctly when initializing the `_engine_type` object.

The weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` is used to avoid creating a reference cycle, which could prevent objects from being garbage collected when they are no longer needed. However, in this case, the weak reference `period` is created but not passed to the `_engine_type` constructor as intended.

To fix this bug, the weak reference `period` should be passed to the `_engine_type` constructor along with the length of the object. This will ensure that the weak reference is properly utilized and the reference cycle is avoided.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By passing the weak reference `period` as an argument to the `_engine_type` constructor, the bug will be fixed and the function will work as intended.
