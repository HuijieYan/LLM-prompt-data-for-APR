The buggy function `_engine` is trying to return an instance of `_engine_type` by passing a weak reference of `self` (the `PeriodIndex` object) and the length of `self`. The bug lies in the fact that the weak reference `period` is not being dereferenced before passing it to `_engine_type`.

The corrected version should dereference the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`. Here's the corrected version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

By calling `period()` instead of just passing `period`, we are dereferencing the weak reference and passing the actual object (`self`) to `_engine_type`.

This change should fix the bug and prevent reference cycles when creating instances of `_engine_type` within the `PeriodIndex` class.
