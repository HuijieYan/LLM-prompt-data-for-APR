The buggy function `_engine` is trying to create a weak reference to `self` using `weakref.ref()` and then pass it to `_engine_type` along with the length of the `self` object. The intention seems to be to avoid creating a strong reference cycle between the `_engine` and the `PeriodIndex` object.

The bug in this function is that `weakref.ref(self)` is being used and assigned to `period`, but `period` is never actually dereferenced to obtain the original object. Instead, it should be used like `period()`. 

To fix this bug, you should modify the `_engine` function to actually use the weak reference by calling `period()` to get the original `self` object as follows:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

This correction will properly dereference the weak reference to obtain the original `self` object before passing it to `_engine_type`.
