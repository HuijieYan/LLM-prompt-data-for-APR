### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object. This weak reference is then passed to `_engine_type` along with the length of the object. The intention here is to avoid a reference cycle by creating a weak reference.

### Potential Error Locations:
The potential error in this function could be related to how the weak reference is created and used. If not done correctly, it might not achieve the intended purpose of breaking the reference cycle.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug could be caused by incorrectly creating or using the weak reference. This can lead to unexpected behavior or failure to break the reference cycle.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is properly created and used to break the reference cycle. We should also ensure that the weak reference is passed correctly to `_engine_type` along with the length of the object.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self), None)
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that the weak reference `period` is passed along with the length of the object and an additional `None` argument to `_engine_type`. This should help in correctly breaking the reference cycle and avoiding any issues related to memory management.
