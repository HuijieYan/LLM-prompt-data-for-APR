1. **Analysis**:
   - The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` decorator in the `PeriodIndex` class.
   - It returns an instance of `_engine_type` by passing a weak reference of `self`.

2. **Identified Error**:
   - The issue lies in how the `weakref.ref()` is used to create a weak reference to `self`.
   - When trying to access attributes or methods of the weak reference `period` later, it may raise a `WeakReferenceError`.
   
3. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - The use of `weakref.ref(self)` in this context may result in the weak reference being garbage collected prematurely if there are no strong references to `self`. This can lead to unexpected behavior when trying to access attributes or methods of the weak reference.

4. **Fix Strategy**:
   - Use the weak reference only when needed, ensuring that a strong reference to `self` is maintained as long as necessary.
   - When passing `period` to `_engine_type`, ensure that `_engine_type` handles the weak reference appropriately to prevent premature garbage collection.

5. **Corrected Version**:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we pass `self` directly to `_engine_type` without creating a weak reference. This ensures that `self` is not prematurely garbage collected and can be accessed correctly within `_engine_type`.
