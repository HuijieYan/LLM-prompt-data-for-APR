The bug in the provided function `_engine` is that it attempts to create a weak reference to `self`, but due to incorrect usage of `weakref.ref`, it doesn't actually store the reference properly. As a result, when `self` is garbage collected, the weak reference becomes invalid and can cause unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, you can create a proper weak reference to `self` by storing it in a class attribute. Here's a corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    if not hasattr(self, '_weakref'):
        self._weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    period = self._weakref
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In this corrected version, we first check if `self` has a `_weakref` attribute. If it doesn't, we create a weak reference to `self` and store it in the `_weakref` attribute. Then we use this properly stored weak reference in the `_engine` function.

This fix ensures that the weak reference to `self` is maintained properly and avoids the reference cycle issue that can lead to bugs and unexpected behavior.
