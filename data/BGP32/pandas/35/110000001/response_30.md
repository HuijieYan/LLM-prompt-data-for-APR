The buggy function `_engine` is attempting to create a weak reference to the `self` instance of the `PeriodIndex` class. However, the implementation contains an error as it tries to pass `self` directly to `self._engine_type`, instead of passing the weak reference of `self`.

To fix this bug:
1. Update the `_engine` function to correctly create a weak reference to `self`.
2. Pass the weak reference instead of `self` to `self._engine_type` to avoid a reference cycle.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
from pandas.core.dtypes.generic import ABCIndexClass
import numpy as np

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self) if np.prod(self.shape) != 0 else 0)
```

In the corrected version, we first import required modules and then correctly create a weak reference to the `self` instance. This weak reference is then passed to `self._engine_type` along with the length of the index. The `np.prod(self.shape) != 0` check ensures that the length is set to 0 if the shape of the index is empty.
