The bug in the `_engine` function lies in the way it's trying to create a weak reference to `self` using `weakref.ref(self)`. The weak reference created in this way will be immediately garbage collected because there are no strong references to the weak reference object. This leads to the `_engine` function attempting to access an invalid weak reference object later on when `self` is no longer in scope, causing a `ReferenceError`.

To fix this bug, we should create a strong reference to `self` before creating a weak reference to it. This way, the weak reference will still have a valid object to reference even if all strong references go out of scope. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Create a strong reference to self
        self_ref = self
        # Pass a weakref of self to _engine_type
        period = weakref.ref(self_ref)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By creating a strong reference `self_ref` and then using `weakref.ref(self_ref)`, we ensure that the weak reference will refer to a valid object for as long as the `_engine` function is being used.
