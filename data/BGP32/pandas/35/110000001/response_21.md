### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object, but it is not being used effectively to avoid reference cycles. In the buggy function, the weak reference `period` is not being dereferenced before being passed to `_engine_type`, potentially causing issues with the reference cycle.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_engine` function is caused by not dereferencing the weak reference `period` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This can lead to the weak reference not being properly utilized to avoid reference cycles, potentially causing memory leaks or other issues related to cyclic references.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to dereference the weak reference `period` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This ensures that the weak reference mechanism is used correctly to avoid reference cycles.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)()
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `period` is called as a function `weakref.ref(self)()` to get the actual object reference from the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`. This ensures that the weak reference is properly dereferenced before being used to avoid reference cycles.
