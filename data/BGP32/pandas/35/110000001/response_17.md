### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is trying to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object to avoid reference cycles. However, the way `weakref.ref(self)` is being used is incorrect, leading to potential issues with referencing the object `self`.

### Identifying potential error locations:
1. Incorrect usage of `weakref.ref(self)` can cause problems with referencing the `self` object.
2. The `_engine_type` method is being called with `period` and `len(self)` parameters, which might not work correctly due to the weak reference.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by incorrectly trying to create a weak reference to the `self` object in the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class. This can lead to unexpected behavior or issues with references to the `PeriodIndex` object.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `self` object is handled correctly so that it does not cause any issues with referencing the object. We should also ensure that the `_engine_type` method is called correctly with the weak reference.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weak reference of self to _engine_type.
        weak_self = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(weak_self, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we create a variable `weak_self` to hold the weak reference to the `self` object. This way, we can correctly pass the weak reference to the `_engine_type` method without causing any reference-related issues.
