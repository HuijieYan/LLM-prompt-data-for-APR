The bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class is related to the usage of `weakref.ref(self)` which creates a weak reference to the `self` object. The intention behind using a weak reference is to prevent reference cycles, but in this case, it is not being used correctly.

The issue here is that the `period` variable is assigned the weak reference to `self`, but then it is never actually used in the `_engine_type` constructor. As a result, the `self` object may be garbage collected prematurely, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.

To fix this bug, you can modify the `_engine` function to maintain a strong reference to `self` while also using a weak reference for `period`. This can be achieved by storing `self` in a local variable before creating the weak reference.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_weakref, len(self))
```

By storing `self` in the `period_weakref` variable, you maintain a strong reference to the object within the function scope, while also passing a weak reference to `_engine_type` to avoid reference cycles.

With this modification, the bug in the `_engine` function should be fixed.
