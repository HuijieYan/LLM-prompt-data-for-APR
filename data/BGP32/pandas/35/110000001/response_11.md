The bug in the `_engine` function is that `self` is being passed to `weakref.ref`, which is causing a reference cycle and preventing the garbage collector from reclaiming memory. This can lead to memory leaks and inefficient memory usage.

To fix this bug, we need to pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type` instead of directly passing `self`. This way, the reference cycle will be broken and the garbage collector will be able to reclaim memory properly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By making this change, the bug in the `_engine` function will be fixed, and the memory management of the `PeriodIndex` class will be improved.
