The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is the `PeriodIndex` instance. However, it seems that the intention was to pass a weak reference of `self` to the `_engine_type` constructor, but the `weakref.ref()` function is not being used correctly in this context.

To fix the bug, you should directly pass `self` to the `_engine_type` constructor instead of creating a weak reference using `weakref.ref()`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Pass self directly to the _engine_type constructor
        return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By directly passing `self` to the `_engine_type` constructor, you avoid creating an unnecessary weak reference and the bug is fixed.
