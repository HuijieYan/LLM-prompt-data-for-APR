### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine(self)` is utilizing a weak reference to avoid reference cycles, but there seems to be an issue with how the weak reference is being utilized. The `period` variable is defined as a weak reference to `self`, but it is not being properly passed to `_engine_type`. This results in `period` not being used as intended, leading to a potential `None` being passed instead of the correct reference.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises because the weak reference to self (`period`) is not being correctly utilized in passing it to `_engine_type`, causing potential reference issues and ultimately leading to unexpected behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, ensure that the `period` weak reference is correctly passed to `_engine_type` to maintain the intended weak reference behavior and prevent reference cycle issues. By passing the correct weak reference, the function should behave as intended.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `period()` is used to retrieve the referenced object from the weak reference when passing it to `_engine_type`, ensuring that the correct object reference is used. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and prevent any unexpected behavior related to weak references.
