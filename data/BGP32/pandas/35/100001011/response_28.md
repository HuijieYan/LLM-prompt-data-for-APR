### Analysis
From the provided information, we can see that the bug is related to weak references and specifically to the PeriodIndex being dropped prematurely, causing the PeriodEngine to receive None instead of the PeriodIndex. This issue is preventing the function from working correctly and causing unexpected behavior.

### Bug Cause
The current implementation of the `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` (the PeriodIndex object) but not using it effectively. This leads to the weak reference not being retained until the `_engine_type` constructor is called, resulting in the weak reference being lost and `None` being passed instead of the PeriodIndex.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until it is used within the `_engine_type` constructor. One way to achieve this is by storing the weak reference as an instance attribute of the object (self) to prolong its lifetime.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    if not hasattr(self, '_weakref'):
        self._weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._weakref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference as an instance attribute (`self._weakref`) inside the PeriodIndex object, we ensure that the weak reference remains valid until needed by the `_engine_type` constructor. This correction should resolve the issue described in the GitHub problem and result in the expected behavior.
