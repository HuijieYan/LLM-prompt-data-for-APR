### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` (which is a `PeriodIndex` object) before passing it to `_engine_type`. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the weak reference is being dropped earlier than intended, resulting in the engine receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the fact that `weakref.ref(self)` is assigned to a local variable `period` but not actually used when creating the `PeriodIndex` object. This results in the weak reference being dropped prematurely.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the weak reference `period` needs to be incorporated correctly when creating the `PeriodIndex` object. By using `period` in the engine creation step, we ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until then.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `period()` is used to retrieve the original `PeriodIndex` object from the weak reference, ensuring that the weak reference is maintained until the engine is created.
