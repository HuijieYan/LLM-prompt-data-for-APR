### Analysis:
1. The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`.
2. The issue on GitHub indicates that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` gets dropped prematurely, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.
3. This premature dropping of weak reference could be causing the bug and resulting in the unexpected behavior observed in the failing tests.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the premature dropping of the weak reference `PeriodIndex`, which leads to the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This results in unexpected behavior and failing tests.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` remains valid throughout the function call to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Keep a strong reference to self to avoid premature dropping of the weakref
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

In the corrected version, we use `weakref.proxy(self)` to keep a strong reference to `self`, preventing the premature dropping of the weak reference. This should resolve the issue described on GitHub and fix the bug in the function.
