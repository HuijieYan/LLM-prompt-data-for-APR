The bug in the `_engine` function is related to the weak reference usage. The `weakref.ref` function returns a weak reference object which does not hold a strong reference to the original object. In this case, the `period` variable, which is supposed to hold a weak reference to `self`, is not correctly utilized in the subsequent code.

The bug causes the `_engine` function to pass a `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex` object to the `_engine_type` function, leading to unexpected behavior and errors.

To fix this bug, we need to maintain a proper weak reference to `self` throughout the function and ensure it is correctly passed to `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In this corrected version, we use `period()` to obtain the actual object from the weak reference, ensuring that the weak reference is dereferenced correctly before passing it to `_engine_type`.

This correction should resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to losing weakrefs when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`. The corrected function should now correctly pass the `PeriodIndex` object to `_engine_type` without losing the weak reference.
