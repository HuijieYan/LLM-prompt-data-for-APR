### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is trying to create a weak reference to `self` (a PeriodIndex object) using `weakref.ref(self)`. However, the usage is incorrect, as `weakref.ref` creates a weak reference to `self`, but the return value of `weakref.ref(self)` is not being dereferenced correctly before passing it as an argument to `self._engine_type()`, resulting in passing a weak reference object instead of the actual `PeriodIndex` object.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is causing the `PeriodIndex` object to be dropped prematurely, resulting in a `None` being passed to the `PeriodEngine` constructor when it is expecting a `PeriodIndex` object, leading to unexpected behavior and errors.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly dereference the weak reference object before passing it to `self._engine_type()`. This can be achieved by calling the weak reference object with `()` to retrieve the actual object.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By calling `weakref.ref(self)()` we retrieve the actual `self` object from the weak reference, resolving the issue of passing `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex` object to the `PeriodEngine` constructor. This corrected version addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue by ensuring that the correct object is passed to `_engine_type()`.
