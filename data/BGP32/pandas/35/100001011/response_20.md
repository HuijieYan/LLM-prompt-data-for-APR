## Bug Fix:

### Analysis:
1. The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` (PeriodIndex), but the weak reference is not being passed correctly to `_engine_type`.
2. Due to the incorrect implementation, the weak reference is not maintained, leading to issues when accessing the weakly referenced object.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the improper usage of `weakref.ref(self)` without utilizing it properly when calling `_engine_type`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference created using `weakref.ref(self)` is properly passed to `_engine_type` to maintain the reference correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

from pandas.tslib import PeriodEngine

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return PeriodEngine(period, len(self))
```

By passing the weak reference `period` to `PeriodEngine`, the corrected version ensures that the reference to `PeriodIndex` is properly maintained, resolving the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
