### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is supposed to return a weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to avoid reference cycles. However, the implementation of creating a weak reference to `self` is incorrect. The issue on GitHub indicates that the problem causes the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

### Error location
The error is in the line:
```python
period = weakref.ref(self)
```
This line incorrectly creates a weak reference to `self`, which does not properly pass a weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to the `PeriodEngine`.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the weak reference to `self` is used incorrectly. This leads to the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

### Suggested Fix
To fix the bug, we need to correctly create a weak reference to `self` and pass it to the `PeriodEngine` so that the reference cycle is avoided. One way to achieve this is to modify the code as follows:

1. Use `weakref.proxy(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`.
2. Pass the weak reference instance to the `PeriodEngine`.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref.proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we ensure that a weak reference to `self` is correctly passed to the `PeriodEngine`, resolving the bug mentioned in the GitHub issue.
