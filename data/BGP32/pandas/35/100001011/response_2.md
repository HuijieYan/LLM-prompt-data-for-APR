### Analysis
The `@cache_readonly` decorator implies that the `_engine` function should return a cached value after the first call. However, the issue described on GitHub suggests that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` instance is being dropped prematurely, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

### Bug Identification
The bug is likely occurring due to the `period` variable being assigned a weak reference to `self`, but not being retained for the lifetime of the `_engine` function.

### Bug Cause
The weak reference stored in the `period` variable is not being preserved within the `_engine` function, resulting in premature garbage collection and the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the weak reference to `self` should be stored in a way that prevents it from being garbage collected until it's no longer needed. One approach could be storing it as an attribute of the `_engine` function to maintain the weak reference.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weakref object as an attribute to maintain the reference
    self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
``` 

By storing the weak reference as an attribute of the `_engine` function, the reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance will be preserved and prevent the premature garbage collection issue described in the GitHub report.
