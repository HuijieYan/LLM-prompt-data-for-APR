## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is supposed to return an instance of `_engine_type` using `self` as a weak reference. However, the bug seems to be related to how the `period` weak reference is created and used within the function. The issue is related to maintaining weak references to `PeriodIndex` objects properly in a `MultiIndex`, leading to unexpected behavior when checking monotonicity.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the weak reference to `self` (which is the `PeriodIndex` object) is created using `weakref.ref(self)`. This should create a weak reference to `self`, but due to how the weak reference is handled within the function, it is not maintained properly. This incorrect handling of weak references leads to `None` being passed instead of the intended `PeriodIndex` object to `_engine_type`, causing issues when checking monotonicity.

## Bug Fixing Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained correctly throughout the function `_engine`. This can be achieved by creating the weak reference outside of the return scope and keeping a strong reference to it within the function. By doing so, we can avoid losing the weak reference prematurely and ensure that the `PeriodIndex` object is correctly passed to `_engine_type`.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    # Maintain a strong reference to the weak reference
    period = period()
    
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By maintaining a strong reference to the weak reference `period` inside the function, we ensure that the `PeriodIndex` object is passed correctly to `_engine_type`, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
