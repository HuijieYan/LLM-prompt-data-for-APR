The issue mentioned on GitHub indicates that there is a bug related to weak references when copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex, leading to an error where the PeriodEngine receives None instead of the PeriodIndex.

### Potential error locations:
1. `period = weakref.ref(self)` may not be correctly preserving the weak reference to self.
2. `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))` might be encountering an issue due to the weak reference being dropped prematurely.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the weak reference to the PeriodIndex `self` is not being preserved correctly, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving None instead of the intended PeriodIndex.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is preserved until it is used to create the PeriodEngine object. This can be achieved by properly handling the weak reference within the function.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Preserve weak reference to avoid a reference cycle
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `weakref.proxy(self)` is used to create a weak reference to `self`, ensuring that the reference is maintained until it is used to create the PeriodEngine object. This modification should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
