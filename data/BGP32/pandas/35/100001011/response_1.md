### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is trying to create a weak reference to `self` (which is a `PeriodIndex` object), pass it to `_engine_type`, and return the result. The issue identified on GitHub indicates that this weak reference handling is causing problems when the `PeriodIndex` is passed to a MultiIndex creation process, resulting in unexpected behavior.

### Error Location
The issue seems to stem from how the weak reference to `self` is being handled in the function. The weakref is assigned to `period`, but the issue report suggests that it is being dropped prematurely, causing `_engine_type` to receive `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

### Cause of the Bug
The buggy function's use of a weak reference is not properly preserving the reference to `self`, leading to unexpected behavior later in the code.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
Instead of using a weak reference with `period`, we need to ensure that `self` is correctly passed to `_engine_type`. One potential solution is to directly pass `self` to `_engine_type` without relying on weak references.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
