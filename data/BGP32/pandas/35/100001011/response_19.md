### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` (which is an instance of `PeriodIndex`). This weak reference is then passed to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`. However, the issue arises when the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before it should be, causing the `_engine_type` function to receive `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the premature dropping of the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` before it is passed to `_engine_type`, resulting in `None` being passed instead of the actual `PeriodIndex`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` remains valid until it is used in the `_engine_type` function call. One way to achieve this is to create a local variable inside the `_engine` function to hold the weak reference, thereby ensuring that it stays in scope until it is used.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a local variable to hold the weak reference
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_weakref, len(self))
```

By creating a local variable `period_weakref` to hold the weak reference, we ensure that the reference remains valid until it is used in the `_engine_type` function, resolving the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
