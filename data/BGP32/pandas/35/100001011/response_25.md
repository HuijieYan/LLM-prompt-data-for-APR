### Analysis
The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object and pass it to `_engine_type`. However, the weak reference is not being properly maintained, leading to the `None` value being passed instead of the `PeriodIndex` object.

### Bug Cause
The weak reference created by `weakref.ref(self)` is not stored in a variable that persists beyond the `_engine` function's scope, so it gets garbage collected, resulting in passing `None` to `_engine_type`.

### Bug Fix
To address this issue, we need to store the weak reference created by `weakref.ref(self)` in a persistent variable to prevent it from being garbage collected prematurely.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference in a persistent variable
    self._weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._weakref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference in `self._weakref`, we ensure that the reference persists beyond the scope of the `_engine` function, preventing it from being garbage collected prematurely. This correction should resolve the issue described in the GitHub problem.
