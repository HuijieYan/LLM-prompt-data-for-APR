### Analysis:
The bug seems to be related to the usage of weak references in the `_engine` function. The function is supposed to return the `_engine_type` attribute initialized with a `weakref` of `self` and the length of `self`. However, the weak reference setup is incorrect, leading to the engine receiving `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The way the weak reference is created with `period = weakref.ref(self)` might not be correct.
2. The passing of `period` to the `_engine_type` might not maintain the reference properly.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises because the weak reference of `self` is not being used correctly in setting up the `_engine_type`. This results in the weak reference being dropped before intended, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the weak reference setup should be corrected to ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives the `PeriodIndex` as expected. Adjustments in how the weak reference is created and passed to `_engine_type` should be made to prevent the premature dropping of the reference.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we can maintain a weak reference to `self` without dropping it prematurely. This corrected version should address the issue described in the GitHub report and ensure the proper functioning of the `_engine` function.
