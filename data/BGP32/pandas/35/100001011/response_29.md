The bug in the `_engine` function is causing weakly referenced objects to be dropped prematurely, resulting in unexpected behavior and errors, as described in the GitHub issue. The weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object is not properly passed to the `_engine_type`, leading to None being used instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the weakly referenced object is used correctly and not dropped prematurely. We can achieve this by modifying the `_engine` function as follows:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

The corrected version of the `_engine` function ensures that the weakly referenced `self` object is correctly passed to the `_engine_type` function by invoking `period()` to get the intended reference. This change should resolve the issue described in the GitHub problem and prevent weakly referenced objects from being dropped prematurely.
