Based on the provided information, the bug in the `_engine` function is due to how the weak reference to `self` is being used. In the current implementation, the weak reference `period` is not being properly used to ensure that the `PeriodIndex` instance is not destroyed prematurely, leading to a `None` value being passed to the `_engine_type` constructor.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the way the weak reference is being handled. We can ensure that the `PeriodIndex` instance stays alive until the `_engine_type` constructor is called. One way to achieve this is by storing the weak reference to `self` in a local variable within the function and using it when calling the `_engine_type` constructor.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a weak reference to self in a local variable
    weak_self = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weak_self, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference in the local variable `weak_self`, we ensure that the `PeriodIndex` instance is kept alive until it is passed to the `_engine_type` constructor.

This fix addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue where the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` was dropped prematurely, resulting in unexpected behavior.
