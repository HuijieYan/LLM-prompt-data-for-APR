The buggy function `_engine` is intended to return an instance of the `_engine_type` class with a weak reference to the `self` object. However, the issue arises due to the weak reference being stored in a local variable `period` instead of being passed directly to the `_engine_type` constructor. This causes the weak reference to get lost when the function returns, leading to unexpected behavior as described in the GitHub issue.

To fix this issue, the weak reference should be passed directly to the `_engine_type` constructor rather than storing it in a local variable. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```

By directly passing the weak reference to the `_engine_type` constructor, the weak reference will be maintained and not get lost when the function returns. This should fix the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
