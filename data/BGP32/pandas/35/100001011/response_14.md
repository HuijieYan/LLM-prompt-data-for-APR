### Identify the Bug
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference of the `self` object, a `PeriodIndex` in this case. However, the issue seems to be related to the weak reference being lost before it is intended to be used, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the actual `PeriodIndex`.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug arises from the fact that the weak reference `period` is not being retained or utilized correctly in the `_engine` function, causing it to be lost before needed. This behavior is likely resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None`, as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure the weak reference `period` is properly retained throughout the function's execution. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference in a local variable before returning it to the `PeriodEngine`.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference in `period_ref` and passing it to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the reference is available when needed, thus resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
