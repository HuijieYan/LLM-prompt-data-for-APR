The buggy function `_engine` is supposed to return the `_engine_type` with a weak reference of `self` as a parameter. The buggy function creates a weak reference to `self` using `weakref.ref(self)`, but it mistakenly passes it as `period` to `_engine_type` instead of passing `period()` to retrieve the weakly referenced object.

The fix for this bug is to change `period = weakref.ref(self)` to `period = weakref.ref(self)()`, which correctly retrieves the weakly referenced object.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
