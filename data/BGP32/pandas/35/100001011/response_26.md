### Analysis:
1. The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to avoid reference cycles.
2. The function returns the result of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.
3. The issue description mentions that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object is dropped earlier than intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.
4. This premature dropping of the weak reference causes the bug and leads to the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the premature dropping of the weak reference causing the issue, we need to ensure that the `PeriodIndex` object referenced by the weak reference remains available for the `PeriodEngine`. One way to achieve this is by storing the weak reference as a class attribute to ensure it's preserved until it's no longer needed.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function below
def _engine(self):
    if not hasattr(self, '_period_ref'):
        self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    
    period = self._period_ref
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected version:
- We check if the `_period_ref` attribute already exists before creating a new weak reference to avoid creating multiple weak references.
- The `period` variable now directly accesses the stored weak reference from the class attribute to ensure the `PeriodIndex` object is not prematurely dropped.
- By maintaining the weak reference as a class attribute, we ensure that it remains available for the `PeriodEngine`, resolving the issue raised in the GitHub bug report.
