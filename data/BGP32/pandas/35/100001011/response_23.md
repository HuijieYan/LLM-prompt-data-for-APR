## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` and passing it to the `_engine_type` function. However, it seems like there is an issue with the usage of weak references causing a `None` value to be passed instead of the intended `PeriodIndex` object.

The provided GitHub issue indicates that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped prematurely, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the actual `PeriodIndex`.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the premature dropping of the weak reference to the `self` object (in this case, a `PeriodIndex` object) due to the way weak references are handled in the `_engine` function. This results in a `None` value being passed to the `_engine_type` function, leading to incorrect behavior, as described in the GitHub issue.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is held until the point where it is no longer needed. One way to achieve this is to store the weak reference as an instance attribute of the `_engine` function so that it doesn't get garbage collected prematurely.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    if not hasattr(self, "_period_weakref"):
        # Store the weak reference as an instance attribute
        self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    
    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

In this corrected version, we store the weak reference as `_period_weakref` on the object itself, ensuring that it remains accessible until the `_engine_type` function uses it. This should resolve the issue described in the GitHub problem statement.
