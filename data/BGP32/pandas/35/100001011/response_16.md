### Analysis
1. The `_engine()` function is supposed to return an instance of `self._engine_type` with a weak reference to `self` passed as an argument.
2. The issue mentioned in GitHub indicates that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.
3. The bug is likely related to the weak reference handling and could be causing incorrect behavior when creating the `PeriodEngine`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until it is no longer needed by the `PeriodEngine` instance creation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the handling of the weak reference to `self` within the `_engine()` function. We should ensure that the weak reference is maintained until the `PeriodEngine` instance is created. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine
```

By storing the result of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` in a variable (`engine`) and returning that variable, we ensure that the weak reference to `self` stays valid until the engine is created and returned. This fix should address the issue of losing the weak reference to `PeriodIndex` prematurely.
