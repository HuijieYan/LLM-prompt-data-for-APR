### Analysis
The bug seems to be related to the weak reference mechanism used in the `_engine` function. The function is creating a weak reference to `self` (a `PeriodIndex` object), but it is not preserving the reference correctly. This results in the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the actual `PeriodIndex` object.

### Cause of the Bug
- The weak reference `period` is not being maintained properly.
- When the `PeriodEngine` is called with `period` as an argument, it ends up receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex` object.

### Fix Strategy
- Ensure the weak reference to `self` (`PeriodIndex` object) is preserved safely.
- Update the `_engine` function to handle the weak reference correctly to pass the actual `PeriodIndex` object to `PeriodEngine`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    period = period_ref()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if period is not None else None
```

This corrected version captures the weak reference correctly and then retrieves the actual `PeriodIndex` object from the weak reference using `period_ref()`. It checks if the retrieved object is not `None` before passing it to `PeriodEngine`.
