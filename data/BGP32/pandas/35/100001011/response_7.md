### Potential Error Locations:
1. The `weakref.ref(self)` call might not be correctly referencing `self`.
2. The `_engine_type` function might not be handling the weak reference properly, resulting in a `None` value.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before it's intended, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This results in errors when accessing attributes of the indexes later on.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the `weakref.ref(self)` call correctly references `self`.
2. Verify that the `_engine_type` function can handle weak references properly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_instance = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine_instance
``` 

By correctly returning the `engine_instance` in the corrected version, we ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives the intended `PeriodIndex` resulting in correct behavior as expected.
