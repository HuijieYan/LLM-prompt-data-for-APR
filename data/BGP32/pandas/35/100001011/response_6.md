### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref` to create a weak reference to the `self` object, which is supposed to prevent a reference cycle. However, in the provided implementation, the weak reference `period` is not being used correctly when passed to `_engine_type`.

The bug seems to be causing issues when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` as described in the GitHub issue. The weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped prematurely, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the function is that the weak reference `period` is created but not utilized correctly. When passing `period` to `_engine_type`, it should have been dereferenced appropriately to get the actual object it refers to (`self`). However, in the current implementation, `period` is passed directly without fetching the original object.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly dereference the weak reference `period` to obtain the `self` object before passing it to `_engine_type`. This will ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives the correct `PeriodIndex` object.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Dereference the weak reference to get the original object
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
