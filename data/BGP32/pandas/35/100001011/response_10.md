## Analysis
The bug in the `_engine` function is related to the usage of weak reference in the `period` variable. The function is meant to pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`, but the implementation is incorrect, leading to the `period` variable being used incorrectly as a weak reference.

## Error Location
The error lies in the creation of the `period` variable using `weakref.ref(self)`. This line does not create a weak reference properly, causing issues when accessing it later on.

## Bug Cause
The bug causes the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to be dropped prematurely, leading `_engine_type` to receive None instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to create a proper weak reference to `self` and pass that weak reference to `_engine_type`. By correctly using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we can ensure that `_engine_type` receives the weak reference appropriately.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
