### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` function that creates a weak reference to `self`, which is a `PeriodIndex` object. It then passes this weak reference to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`. The bug arises from the fact that `weakref.ref(self)` is returning a weak reference object instead of the actual object `self`. 

### Error Location
The bug is occurring in the line `period = weakref.ref(self)`, where `weakref.ref(self)` returns a weak reference object instead of the actual `self`.

### Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that when `weakref.ref(self)` is used, it returns a weak reference object instead of the actual object. This results in `_engine_type` receiving a weak reference object instead of the `self` object, leading to the issue reported on GitHub where `PeriodEngine` gets `None` instead of the actual `PeriodIndex`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the actual `self` object is passed to `_engine_type` instead of the weak reference object. This can be achieved by retrieving the actual object from the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Retrieve the actual object from the weak reference
    period = self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By directly using `self` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we ensure that the actual `self` object is passed to `_engine_type`, resolving the bug reported on GitHub.
