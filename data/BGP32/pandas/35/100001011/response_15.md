### Analysis:
The `@cache_readonly` decorator indicates that the `_engine` function is being cached, which implies that the result should be consistent for the same input parameters. However, the bug seems to be related to how the weak reference `period` is used within the function. The weak reference is supposed to prevent reference cycles, but it might not be handled correctly in this context.

### Error Location:
The error likely resides in how the weak reference `period` is passed to `self._engine_type`. The weak reference might not be correctly utilized, leading to issues with the passed reference to the `PeriodEngine`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug could be caused by the weak reference `period` not being dereferenced properly before passing it to `self._engine_type`. This might result in `self._engine_type` receiving a `None` value instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we should ensure that the weak reference is correctly dereferenced before being passed to `self._engine_type`. This might involve properly retrieving the referenced object from the weak reference before passing it to `self._engine_type`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the correct file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `period = weakref.ref(self)()` properly dereferences the weak reference `period` before passing it to `self._engine_type`. This should address the bug and ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives the expected `PeriodIndex`.

By applying this correction, we aim to resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug description regarding losing weakrefs when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`.
