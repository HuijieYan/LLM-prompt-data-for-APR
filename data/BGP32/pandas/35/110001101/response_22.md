### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is meant to return an `_engine_type` instance with a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object. However, the implementation is incorrect as it only creates a weak reference to `self` without handling the weak reference properly.

### Bug
The bug in the function `_engine` is that it creates a weak reference to `self` but doesn't use it effectively when passing it to `_engine_type`. This can lead to potential issues with memory management and reference cycles.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to properly utilize the weak reference created for `self` when passing it to `_engine_type`. We should dereference the weak reference before passing it to ensure that there are no reference cycle issues.

### Corrected Function
```python
# corrected _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

With this correction, the function creates a weak reference to `self`, dereferences it before passing it to `_engine_type`, and returns the `_engine_type` instance.
