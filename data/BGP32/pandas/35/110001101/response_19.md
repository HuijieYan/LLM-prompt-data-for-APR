The bug in the `_engine` function is caused by incorrectly creating a weak reference to `self` and passing it to `_engine_type`. The correct approach is to create a weak reference to `self` outside of the return statement to ensure that the weak reference persists and accurately references the `PeriodIndex` object.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function as follows:
```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass the weakref to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By making this change, we ensure that the weak reference to `self` remains valid and is correctly passed to `_engine_type`.

This corrected version of the function should now properly handle the weak reference creation for `self` and address the bug.
