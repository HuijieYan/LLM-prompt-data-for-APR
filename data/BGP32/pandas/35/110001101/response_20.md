### Analysis
The `_engine` function is expected to create and return an instance of `_engine_type` using a weak reference to the `self` object. However, in the buggy function, it is incorrectly trying to assign a weak reference to `self` to a variable `period` and passing that to `_engine_type`.

### Bug Cause
The bug is occurring because `weakref.ref(self)` is creating a weak reference object to `self` and storing it in the variable `period`. Then, when creating the `_engine_type` instance, it's passing this weak reference object instead of the actual `self` object.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we should directly pass the `self` object when creating the `_engine_type` instance instead of a weak reference object.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Directly pass self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
