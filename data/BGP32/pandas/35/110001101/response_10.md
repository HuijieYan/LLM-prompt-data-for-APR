The bug in the `_engine` function is that it is creating a weak reference to `self` and passing it to `_engine_type`, which is likely causing the weak reference to be garbage collected before being used as intended. This results in an error or unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, we should pass `self` directly to `_engine_type` without creating a weak reference.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# Fixed version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

This correction ensures that `self` is passed as intended without using a weak reference, which should solve the issue with the original buggy implementation.
