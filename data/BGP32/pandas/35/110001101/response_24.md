The bug in the `_engine` function is that it is not correctly assigning the weak reference of `self` to the `Period` object. The usage of `weakref.ref` is not correct in this context.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to correctly create a weak reference for `self` and then pass it to `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, create a weak reference for self
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref(), len(self))
``` 

In this corrected version, we create a weak reference to `self` using `weakref.ref(self)` and then immediately call it using `period_ref()` to get the actual reference to `self`. This corrected version ensures that there is no reference cycle issue and `self` can be effectively passed to `_engine_type`.

By applying this fix, the `_engine` function should now correctly create the weak reference for `self` and avoid the reference cycle issue that was present before.
