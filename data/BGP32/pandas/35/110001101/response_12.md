The bug in the function `_engine` is due to the incorrect instantiation of the weak reference object. The weak reference should be created for the whole object, not just for one of its attributes. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the weak reference is created by passing the whole object `self` instead of just an attribute.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the `self` object will be passed as a weak reference to the `_engine_type` method, preventing any potential reference cycles and fixing the bug.
