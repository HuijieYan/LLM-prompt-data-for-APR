The bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class is due to the incorrect usage of the `weakref` module. The function is attempting to create a weak reference `period` of `self`, but the weak reference is not properly utilized when creating `_engine_type`.

To fix this bug, we should modify the way the weak reference is used in the `_engine` function. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we call `period()` to retrieve the original object from the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`. This ensures that the weak reference is properly dereferenced and the correct object is passed to `_engine_type`.

This correction should resolve the bug and ensure that the function behaves as expected based on the provided input/output values and types.
