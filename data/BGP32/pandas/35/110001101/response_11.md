## Fixing the Bug

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_engine` function is due to the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance. The correct way to create a weak reference to an object in Python is to use the `weakref.proxy()` function instead of `weakref.ref()`. By using `weakref.ref()`, the weak reference is not properly accessible for use in the `_engine_type`.

### Fixing Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to replace `weakref.ref(self)` with `weakref.proxy(self)` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance.

### Corrected Version of the Bug
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function with the bug fixed:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref.proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By making this change, the weak reference is correctly utilized in the `_engine_type` function, resolving the bug in the `_engine` method.
