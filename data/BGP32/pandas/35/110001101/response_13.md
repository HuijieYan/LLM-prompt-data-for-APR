### Explanation of the bug
The bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class arises from the usage of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` and then passing it to `_engine_type`. The intention is to prevent a reference cycle, but the implementation is incorrect. When `weakref.ref(self)` is called, it creates a weak reference to the `self` object, which needs to be dereferenced using `.()` to obtain the actual object. However, in this case, the dereferencing is missing, causing `period` to store a weak reference instead of the actual `self` object.

### Fix strategy
To fix this issue, we need to correctly dereference `period` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This can be achieved by calling `period()` to obtain the actual `self` object.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

By making this correction, the weak reference stored in `period` is correctly dereferenced to obtain the actual `self` object before passing it to `_engine_type`, resolving the bug.
