The bug in the provided code lies in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The function is attempting to create a weak reference to `self` (the `PeriodIndex` instance) and then pass it to `_engine_type`. However, the weak reference is not being properly utilized, leading to a bug.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference to `self` is not being dereferenced properly before passing it to `_engine_type`. This can lead to issues with garbage collection and may result in unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to properly dereference the weak reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This can be done by calling the `period` weak reference object to obtain the actual `self` instance before passing it to `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Properly dereference the weak reference to self before passing it to _engine_type
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` instead of just `period`, we correctly retrieve the `self` instance from the weak reference object, which should fix the bug and ensure proper garbage collection.
