The bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class is caused by incorrectly using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`. The correct usage should be to create a weak reference to the `PeriodArray` values which are stored in `self._values` instead of creating a weak reference to `self`. 

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to create a weak reference to `self._values` instead, as that is the intended target for the weak reference to avoid reference cycles.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self._values to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self._values)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By making this change, the `_engine` function will correctly create a weak reference to the `PeriodArray` values stored in `self._values`, preventing any reference cycles from occurring.
