The bug in the `_engine` function arises from the incorrect handling of the weak reference. The `weakref.ref` function is used to create a weak reference to the `self` object of the `PeriodIndex` class, but it is not being used properly when passed to `_engine_type`. As a result, the weak reference is not being resolved correctly within `_engine_type`, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is properly resolved before being passed to `_engine_type`. This can be done by explicitly calling `period()` on the weak reference object to retrieve the actual reference to `self`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` on the weak reference object, we retrieve the actual reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This ensures that the weak reference is properly resolved and the function operates as expected.

This fix addresses the issue with the weak reference handling and should now correctly return the expected values for the given inputs.
