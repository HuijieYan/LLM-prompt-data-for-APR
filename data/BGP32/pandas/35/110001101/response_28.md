### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is attempting to create a weak reference of the `PeriodIndex` object which is unnecessary in this context. The `_engine` function should return an instance of `self._engine_type` passing in `self` and the length of the `PeriodIndex`.

### Bug Explanation
In the current implementation, the `_engine` function is incorrectly using `weakref.ref(self)` which is redundant and not needed for the purpose of creating an instance of `self._engine_type`. This incorrect usage leads to unexpected behavior and errors.

### Fix Strategy
Simply remove the use of `weakref.ref(self)` and directly pass `self` and `len(self)` to `self._engine_type` in the return statement.

### Corrected Version

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
