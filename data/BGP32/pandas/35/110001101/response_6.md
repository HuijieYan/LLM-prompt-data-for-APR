The bug in the `_engine` function lies in the usage of `weakref.ref(self)` which is not capturing the reference to `self` properly. As a result, the `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` call is not receiving the correct reference to `self`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to properly capture the reference to `self` using a lambda function. This lambda function will ensure that the reference to `self` is maintained until the `_engine_type` call is made.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use a lambda function to capture the reference to self
    period = lambda: self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

This correction ensures that the reference to `self` is maintained properly and avoids the reference cycle issue.
