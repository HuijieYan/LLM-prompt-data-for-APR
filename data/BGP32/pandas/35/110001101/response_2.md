### Explanation:
The buggy function `_engine` is trying to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance `self` and pass it to `_engine_type` to avoid a reference cycle. However, the way this is being implemented is incorrect. The `weakref.ref()` function returns a weak reference object, not the object itself, so `period` is actually a weak reference to `self`, not `self` itself.

### Bug:
The bug is in the line:
```python
period = weakref.ref(self)
```
Instead of creating a weak reference object to `self`, it should directly use `self`.

### Fix:
Remove the line `period = weakref.ref(self)` and directly pass `self` to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
