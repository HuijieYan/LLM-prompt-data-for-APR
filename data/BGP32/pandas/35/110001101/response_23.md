The bug in the `_engine` function arises from the use of `weakref.ref(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self._data)` where `_data` is the attribute that holds the actual underlying data of the `PeriodIndex`.

The correct strategy to fix this bug is to replace `period = weakref.ref(self)` with `period = weakref.ref(self._data)` to create a weak reference to the underlying data of the `PeriodIndex` instead of the `PeriodIndex` object itself.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# Correction to the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self._data to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self._data)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By making this change, the `_engine` function will now correctly create a weak reference to the underlying data of the `PeriodIndex` object, resolving the bug.
