## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_engine` function is caused by passing a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type` instead of the actual `self`. This results in the `PeriodIndex` object not being correctly passed to `_engine_type`, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to pass `self` instead of a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type` in the `_engine` function.

## Corrected Version

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
