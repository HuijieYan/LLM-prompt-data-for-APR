The bug in the `_engine` function stems from the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference. The `weakref` function returns a weak reference object that allows the original object to be garbage collected if there are no other strong references to it. However, the weak reference object itself needs to be accessed correctly to retrieve the original object.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `_engine` function to correctly retrieve the original object from the weak reference object before passing it to `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` after creating the weak reference, we can retrieve the original `self` object from the weak reference and pass it to the `_engine_type` function. This fix ensures that the weak reference is correctly utilized to prevent reference cycles without losing access to the original object.
