The bug in the `_engine` function arises from the incorrect usage of the `weakref.ref` method. The `weakref.ref` method returns a weak reference to the object provided, without keeping it alive. In this case, when `period` is assigned a weak reference to `self`, `period` itself becomes a weak reference and doesn't hold a strong reference to `self`, leading to unexpected behavior when used later in `_engine_type`.

To fix this issue, we should modify the `_engine` function to hold a strong reference to `self` instead of using a weak reference. This can be achieved by directly passing `self` to `_engine_type`, ensuring that the reference is not lost.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By making this change, the `_engine` function will now correctly pass a strong reference to `self` to `_engine_type`, resolving the bug caused by the weak reference implementation.
