The bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class is that the `weakref.ref` is not correctly being used to create a weak reference to `self`. This can lead to a reference cycle issue and memory leaks.

To fix this bug, we need to correctly use `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `weakref.ref(self)` is used to create a weak reference, and then `period()` is called to return the original object that the weak reference refers to.

This fix ensures that a correct weak reference is used to prevent reference cycles and potential memory leaks.
