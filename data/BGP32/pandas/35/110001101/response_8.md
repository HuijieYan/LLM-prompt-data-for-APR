The buggy function `_engine` is creating a weak reference to `self` as `period` and then using it in `self._engine_type` to create the engine. However, the weak reference might not be correctly handled, leading to potential issues with garbage collection and the reference cycle.

The strategy for fixing the bug would be to pass the actual `self` to `_engine_type` instead of a weak reference.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By directly passing `self` to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the engine is created with the correct reference, avoiding potential issues related to weak referencing.
