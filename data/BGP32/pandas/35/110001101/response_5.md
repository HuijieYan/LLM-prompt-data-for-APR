The bug in the `_engine` function lies in the way the weak reference to `self` is being created. The current implementation `period = weakref.ref(self)` creates a weak reference to `self`, but does not actually use that reference when creating the `_engine_type`. This means that the weak reference is not being properly utilized, leading to potential reference cycle issues.

To fix this bug, we need to pass the weak reference `period` as an argument to the `_engine_type` constructor. This ensures that the weak reference to `self` is properly utilized in creating the `_engine_type` object.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By passing the weak reference `period` to the `_engine_type`, we ensure that the reference cycle issue is mitigated and the function works as expected with the given input and output values.
