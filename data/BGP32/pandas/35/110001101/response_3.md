The bug in the `_engine` function lies in the weak reference creation. The `weakref.ref` method creates a weak reference, which does not prevent the referenced object (self) from being garbage collected. In this case, the weak reference to `self` is not being stored anywhere, so it gets immediately garbage collected, resulting in `None` being passed to `_engine_type`.

To fix this issue, we should store the weak reference in a variable that would persist beyond the scope of the `_engine` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference in a variable to avoid immediate garbage collection
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_weakref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference in the `period_weakref` variable, we ensure that the reference to `self` persists and is passed correctly to `_engine_type`.

This correction should resolve the issue with the weak reference and ensure that the function behaves as expected with the provided test case.
