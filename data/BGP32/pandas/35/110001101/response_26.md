## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_engine` function arises from the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`. In the buggy code, the weak reference is assigned to `period` but never utilized when calling `_engine_type`. This results in `weakref.ref` being ineffective and does not prevent the reference cycle, which can lead to memory leaks.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to properly use the weak reference provided by `weakref.ref`. The weak reference should be dereferenced when passing it to `_engine_type`. This ensures that the reference to `self` in `_engine_type` does not keep the object alive when it is no longer needed.

## Corrected Version of the _engine function

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

In this corrected version, `period()` dereferences the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`, ensuring that a strong reference is not held unnecessarily.
