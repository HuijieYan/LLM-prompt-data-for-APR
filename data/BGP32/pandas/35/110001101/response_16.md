The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is trying to create a weak reference to `self`, but it is not done correctly causing issues with the weak reference. The weak reference should be created using `weakref.ref(self)()` to get the actual reference.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Create a weak reference to self to avoid reference cycle
        period = weakref.ref(self)()
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By updating the `_engine` function to correctly create a weak reference and retrieve the actual reference, we ensure that there are no issues with reference cycles and the function behaves as expected.
