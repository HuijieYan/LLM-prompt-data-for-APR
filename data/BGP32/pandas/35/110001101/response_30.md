The bug in the `_engine` function is caused by incorrectly passing a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type` instead of the actual `self` object. This results in the weak reference being stored in `period` and returned, causing unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to pass `self` directly to `_engine_type` without using `weakref.ref`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By directly passing `self` to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the actual object is used in the function, resolving the bug and satisfying the expected input/output values.
