The cause of the bug in the `_engine` function is that it is trying to create a weak reference to `self` incorrectly, which can lead to a reference cycle.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the way the weak reference to `self` is created. We should use `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference without actually referencing it.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.proxy(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)`, we ensure that a weak reference to `self` is created without actually creating a reference cycle.

This fix should resolve the issue by correctly creating a weak reference to `self` in the `PeriodIndex` class.
