### Analysis
The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is meant to return an instance of the `_engine_type` class using a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object. However, in the buggy implementation, it is creating a weak reference to `self` but not passing it correctly to `_engine_type`. This could lead to potential issues with reference cycles or incorrect behavior.

### Bug Explanation
The bug lies in how the weak reference to `self` is being handled. The `weakref.ref(self)` creates a weak reference to `self`, but it needs to be passed correctly as an argument to `_engine_type`. Currently, the weak reference is not being used in the return statement.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to pass the weak reference `period` to `_engine_type` in the return statement.

### Corrected Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
