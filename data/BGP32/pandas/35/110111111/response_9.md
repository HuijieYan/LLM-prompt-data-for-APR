Based on the error message and the runtime input/output values, it seems that the issue lies in the `PeriodEngine` class not being able to handle the weak reference properly, causing a `NoneType` error when the `view("i8")` method is called.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust how the weak reference is passed to the `_engine_type` constructor in the `_engine` function. We should ensure that the referenced object is still valid when used in the `PeriodEngine`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
    # Corrected version of the _engine function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

In this corrected version, we use `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a proxy object that will not create a new weak reference, ensuring that the original object referenced by the `self` object remains valid within the `PeriodEngine`.

By making this change, the `_engine` function should now successfully provide a valid reference to the `PeriodEngine`, resolving the `NoneType` error and allowing the failing test to pass.
