The issue with the buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is that it is attempting to use a weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` to prevent a reference cycle. However, the weak reference is not being correctly used, leading to the `_engine_type` method receiving `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex` object.

The bug is causing the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` to fail with the error message:
```
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'
```

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug:
1. Assign the weak reference to `self` to maintain the reference correctly.
2. Update the `_engine` method to correctly utilize the weak reference without losing the reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))  # Update to call weak reference correctly
```

This corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test, ensuring that the `PeriodIndex` object is correctly passed to the `_engine_type` method.
