## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class where a weak reference to `self` is assigned to the variable `period`. The intention is to avoid a reference cycle to prevent memory leaks. However, due to the way the weak reference is established, it results in `self` being garbage collected prematurely, leading to an AttributeError when trying to access the `PeriodEngine` afterwards.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` aims to ensure that the resulting `MultiIndex` after some operations on a `PeriodIndex` maintains monotonicity, but due to the premature garbage collection of `self`, the monotonicity check fails with an AttributeError.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the weak reference approach needs to be revised. Instead of creating a weak reference to `self` within the `_engine` function, a correct approach would be to use a `weakref.proxy` to establish the weak reference. This change would ensure that the existing `PeriodIndex` instance is not prematurely garbage collected.

## The Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This change should resolve the premature garbage collection issue and ensure that the `PeriodIndex` object is still accessible within the `PeriodEngine` when needed.
