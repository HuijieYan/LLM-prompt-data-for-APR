## Bug Fix Analysis

1. The buggy function `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class in the `period.py` file lacks proper initialization of the `PeriodEngine`. This results in an `AttributeError` during execution, indicating that a `NoneType` object has no attribute 'view'.
   
2. The `_engine` function is missing the initialization necessary to handle weak referencing properly, leading to the issue.
   
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` containing a `PeriodIndex`. It then attempts to check if the levels are monotonic, which invokes the buggy `_engine` function. The error message clearly shows that the issue lies within the `PeriodEngine`, indicating a problem with accessing attributes that should be there but appear as `NoneType`.

4. To fix this bug, we need to adjust the `_engine` function to properly handle weak reference initialization and ensure that the `PeriodEngine` is correctly instantiated.

## Bug Fix Strategy

1. Initialize `period` as a weak reference to `self` properly.
2. Ensure that the `PeriodEngine` is correctly instantiated using the weak reference defined above.

## The Corrected Version

```python
@inherit_names(['strftime', 'to_timestamp', 'asfreq', 'start_time', 'end_time'] + PeriodArray._field_ops, PeriodArray, wrap=True)
@inherit_names(['is_leap_year', 'freq', '_format_native_types'], PeriodArray)
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Correctly initialize weak reference
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        
        # Ensure PeriodEngine is correctly instantiated using weak reference
        engine_type = getattr(self, '_engine_type', PeriodEngine)
        return engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By making these changes, the weak referencing issue in the `_engine` function should be resolved, and the corrected function should pass the failing test, leading to the expected output.
