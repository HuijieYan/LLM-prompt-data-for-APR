## Bug Analysis
- The buggy function `_engine` is trying to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object but not handling it properly, leading to an issue where the weak reference becomes None unexpectedly.
- The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is checking if the level values of a `MultiIndex` created from a `PeriodIndex` are monotonic.
- The error message indicates an `AttributeError` related to a method call on a `NoneType` object in the `PeriodEngine` class, implying that the weak reference is not being maintained properly.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because when the `_engine` method creates a weak reference to `self`, it does not keep a strong reference to it. As a result, when the `PeriodEngine` tries to access the weak reference, it finds None instead of the expected `PeriodIndex` object, leading to an AttributeError.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that a strong reference to `self` is maintained alongside the weak reference. This can be achieved by either storing `self` in a variable or using `WeakValueDictionary` from Python's `weakref` module to automatically maintain references.

## The Corrected Version
```python
def _engine(self):
    # Store a strong reference alongside the weak reference
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    self._strongref_self = self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By storing a strong reference to `self` in the `_strongref_self` attribute, we ensure that the `PeriodEngine` has access to the correct `PeriodIndex` object. This change should resolve the AttributeError and make the failing test pass as expected.
