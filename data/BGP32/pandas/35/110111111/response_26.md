## Analysis
- The buggy function `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class is returning the result of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, where `period` is a weak reference to `self`.
- The error occurs when the function `is_monotonic` is called on the `idx2.levels`, which eventually access the `_engine` attribute of each `PeriodIndex`. This leads to an AttributeError as the `_engine` attribute may be None due to a weak reference dropping prematurely.
- The `weakref.ref(self)` is used to create a weak reference of `self` to avoid a reference cycle, but it seems to be the cause of the issue.

## Bug Fix Strategy
- Instead of directly creating the weak reference of `self` within the `_engine` function, we can modify the approach.
- One approach could be to create the weak reference outside of the `_engine` function and retain it in a more persistent way to ensure that it doesn't get garbage collected before it's intended.

## The corrected implementation
```python
# Updated `_engine` function without weak reference creation within the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    if not hasattr(self, '_weakref_period'):
        self._weakref_period = weakref.ref(self)
    period = self._weakref_period
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this modification, a persistent weak reference to `self` is maintained beyond the scope of the `_engine` function, ensuring that it is not prematurely garbage collected, potentially resolving the issue with weak reference dropping.
