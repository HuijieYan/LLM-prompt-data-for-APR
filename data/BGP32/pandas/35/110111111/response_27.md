## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine(self)` in the `PeriodIndex` class returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` tries to check if all levels of a `MultiIndex` are monotonic using the `is_monotonic` attribute.
3. The error message indicates that the issue lies within the `is_monotonic_increasing` function of the `IndexEngine`, specifically in the `view("i8")` method call, resulting in an `AttributeError`.
4. The `PeriodEngine` is likely not correctly instantiated or has an issue with its type or value, causing the `NoneType` error.
5. The GitHub issue supports the observation that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped prematurely.

## Bug Cause:
The `_engine` function does not correctly instantiate `PeriodEngine` due to issues with the weak referencing, causing the `NoneType` error when attempting to call `view("i8")` on it.

## Fix Strategy:
Ensure that the weak reference to `self` (`period`) is maintained throughout the `_engine` function to prevent premature dropping and correctly instantiate `PeriodEngine`.

## Corrected Function:
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return PeriodEngine(period, len(self))
```

By maintaining the weak reference (`period`) throughout the function and passing it correctly to `PeriodEngine`, the corrected function ensures that `self` is not prematurely dropped before instantiation, resolving the `NoneType` error.
