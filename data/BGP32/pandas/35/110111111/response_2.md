## Fixing the bug in the _engine function

The issue arises from the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` being dropped prematurely, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `NoneType` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference remains valid throughout the `_engine` function's execution. One way to achieve this is by using a lambda function to capture the weak reference. Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, capture the weakref in a lambda function.
    period = lambda: weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By encapsulating the weak reference inside a lambda function, we prevent it from being garbage collected before it is used by `self._engine_type`.

With this fix, the weak reference to `self` will be properly maintained, ensuring that the `PeriodEngine` receives the valid `PeriodIndex` instance it expects, resolving the `NoneType` error encountered during the failing test.
