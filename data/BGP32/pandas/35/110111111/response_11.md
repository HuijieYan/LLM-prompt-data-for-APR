## Fixing the Bug

### Issue Analysis
The issue seems to stem from the weak reference not being properly maintained in the `_engine` behavior of `PeriodIndex`, leading to the `NoneType` error when accessing the engine. This error occurs when the `PeriodEngine` tries to access a method on a `None` object.

### Solution Strategy
To address the bug:
1. The weak reference should be correctly maintained within the `_engine` method.
2. Ensure that the weak reference is still valid when accessed, preventing it from resolving to `None`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version:
- `period()` is used to retrieve the actual object from the weak reference to ensure it is not `None`.
- `period` should be called instead of being used directly to access the object. 

By making these changes, the weak reference is correctly accessed, preventing the `NoneType` error.
