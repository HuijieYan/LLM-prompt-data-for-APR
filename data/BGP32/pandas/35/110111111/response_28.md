## Fixing the buggy function

### Analyzing the Issue
The bug arises from the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` being lost prematurely, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` object instead. This leads to an `AttributeError` when trying to access an attribute of the `None` object.

### Cause of the Bug
The `_engine` function is creating a weak reference to `self` but is not preserving it. This weak reference is necessary to avoid reference cycles and ensure safe garbage collection.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Maintain the weak reference to `self` throughout the function execution.
2. Ensure that the weak reference is still valid when accessed by the `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create and retain a weak reference to self
    self_weakref = weakref.ref(self)

    # Pass the weakref of self to _engine_type
    return self._engine_type(self_weakref, len(self))
```

By keeping a reference to `self` in the form of `self_weakref`, we ensure that the relevant memory is not prematurely garbage collected. This should resolve the issue and allow the `_engine_type` to receive the intended `PeriodIndex` object.

After applying this fix, the corrected function should pass the failing test and produce the expected output, satisfying the requirements outlined.
