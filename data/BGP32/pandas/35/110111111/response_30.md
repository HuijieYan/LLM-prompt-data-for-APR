## Analysis
1. The `PeriodIndex` class contains a `_engine` function that creates an instance of `_engine_type` using a weak reference to the current `PeriodIndex` instance.
2. The failing test involves creating a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` and checking if the resulting levels are monotonic, which eventually accesses the `_engine`.
3. The error message indicates that an `AttributeError` occurs when trying to access the `vgetter` attribute, which leads to a `NoneType` error.
4. The issue on GitHub highlights that weak references are being lost, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None`.
   
## Bug Cause
The `_engine_type` method is expecting a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance but is not properly receiving it, leading to weak references being lost and resulting in the error during the test execution.
   
## Fix Strategy
1. Adjust the `_engine` function to correctly create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance and pass it to `_engine_type`.
2. Ensure that weak references are maintained throughout the lifecycle to prevent unintended reference cycles.

## Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if self is not None else None
``` 

After making this change, the errored test should pass successfully.
