### Explanation of the bug
The bug occurs in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The function is supposed to return an instance of `_engine_type`, passing a weak reference of `self` as the first argument. However, due to the implementation issue, `period = weakref.ref(self)` creates a weak reference object `period` without keeping a strong reference to the original object. This results in `period` being destroyed immediately after the assignment, leading to the `_engine` function receiving `None` instead of the actual `self` object.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` utilizes the `PeriodIndex` class in a `MultiIndex` context, resulting in a call to `is_monotonic` on the values. At this point, the `_engine` function is accessed, and since it receives `None` instead of the expected `self`, the attribute access (`view("i8")`) on this `NoneType` object raises an `AttributeError`.

### Fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference object `period` created in the `_engine` function has a strong reference to `self` so that the `self` object is not deleted prematurely. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference object as an instance variable of the `PeriodIndex` class to maintain the reference for the duration of the object's lifetime.

### Corrected version of the `_engine` function
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    self._period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference in `self._period`, we ensure that a reference to `self` is held for as long as the `PeriodIndex` object exists, resolving the issue of premature deletion. This correction should enable the `test_get_level_values_when_periods` test to pass successfully.
