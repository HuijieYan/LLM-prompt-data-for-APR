## Analyzing the buggy function and failing test

### Buggy Function
The `PeriodIndex` class in `pandas` library contains a cached readonly function `_engine` that returns the engine type for the `PeriodIndex`. The function makes use of `weakref` to create a weak reference to the object and then passes it to `_engine_type` to create the engine. However, there seems to be an issue with the weak reference.

### Failing Test
The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` aims to test the behavior of `PeriodIndex` in a `MultiIndex` scenario. The test constructs a `MultiIndex` specifically with `Period` objects and then checks if the resulting levels are monotonic. The test fails with an `AttributeError` related to `view("i8")`.

### Error Description
The error occurs when trying to access the view of a `NoneType` object, which suggests that the `self._engine` function might not be working correctly, leading to a `None` value being returned instead of the expected engine type.

### Potential Bug Location
The issue likely lies in the creation of the weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` within the `_engine` function. This reference might not be correctly tied to the object, causing it to become `None` when accessed later.

### Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is the weak reference creation. Weak references in Python are used to avoid reference cycles and potential memory leaks, but if not handled correctly, they can lead to unexpected behavior like the one observed here.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` within the `_engine` function is properly maintained so that it does not become `None` when accessed. This may involve adjusting how the weak reference is created or handling it differently to maintain the reference.

### Corrected Function

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

With this correction, we are directly passing `self` to the `_engine_type` function instead of using a weak reference. This should avoid the issue of weak reference becoming `None` and resolve the `AttributeError` observed in the failing test.
