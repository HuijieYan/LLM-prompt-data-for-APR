Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test, the error occurs because the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is returning `None` instead of the expected `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. This leads to an AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute from a `NoneType`.

To fix this bug, we need to make sure that the `_engine` function returns the correct engine type instance. We can achieve this by updating the `_engine` function as follows:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if hasattr(self, '_engine_type') else self._default_engine(period, len(self))
```

This update ensures that the correct engine type instance is returned when accessing the `PeriodIndex` attributes.

By implementing this change, the `_engine` function should now correctly return the expected engine type instance, resolving the AttributeError issue encountered during the failing test.
