Based on the analysis, the bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class seems to be related to weak reference handling. The function is supposed to return an instance of `PeriodEngine` initialized with a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance. However, due to weak reference usage, the weak reference gets lost, leading to an `AttributeError` when trying to access the attribute `view` on a `NoneType`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is correctly maintained and used within the `_engine` function. By properly handling the weak reference, we can prevent it from being lost and allow the `PeriodEngine` class to access the appropriate attributes from the `PeriodIndex` instance.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))

```

In this corrected version, the weak reference is accessed with `period()` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, ensuring that the `PeriodIndex` instance is properly referenced by the `PeriodEngine` class. This should resolve the `AttributeError` issue reported in the failing test and align with the expected behavior of the function.
