### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is causing an AttributeError during the failing test execution.
2. The failing test is related to multi-level indexes where weakrefs for PeriodIndex levels are being copied, causing weakly referenced PeriodIndexes to be dropped prematurely.
3. The error occurs when trying to access a view on a `NoneType` object inside the `_do_monotonic_check` method of `IndexEngine`.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object is maintained until it's no longer needed.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by premature dropping of weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` objects before they should be accessed. This leads to the `_engine` attribute returning a `NoneType` object, which causes the AttributeError when trying to access a view on it.

### Fix Strategy
To resolve this issue, we need to modify the `_engine` method to correctly handle weak referencing of the `self` object to ensure it is not prematurely destroyed. We can achieve this by creating a strong reference to the weakly referenced `self` object within the `_engine` method.

### Corrected Version
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Create a strong reference to the weakly referenced self object
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        self._strong_ref_to_period = period
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By creating a strong reference to `self` within the `_engine` method, we prevent premature deletion of the `PeriodIndex` object, ensuring that the `_engine` method can operate correctly.

This corrected version should resolve the AttributeError issue and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
