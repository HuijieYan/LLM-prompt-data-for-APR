The bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class is causing the failing test. The issue arises because the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance is being lost too early, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `NoneType` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex` instance.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance is maintained until it is no longer needed. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self.data))
```

This fix maintains the weak reference `period` to the `PeriodIndex` instance `self` until the `PeriodEngine` is constructed, ensuring that the reference is not lost prematurely. This correction should resolve the issue and allow the failing test to pass as expected.
