## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance. The weak reference is then passed to `self._engine_type` to create the engine. However, the issue arises because the weak reference is being stored in the `period` variable, which is a local variable that goes out of scope once the `_engine` function ends. This results in the engine receiving a `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

Additionally, the GitHub issue highlights that copying levels on a `MultiIndex` constructed with a `PeriodIndex` results in the weakrefs being dropped prematurely, leading to the error in the failing test.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance persists beyond the scope of the `_engine` function. One way to do this is by storing the weak reference as an attribute of the `PeriodIndex` instance itself.

## The Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference as an attribute of the PeriodIndex
    self._weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._weakref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference as `self._weakref`, we ensure that the reference persists as long as the `PeriodIndex` instance exists, resolving the issue of `NoneType` error in the failing test.
