## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is utilizing weak referencing to handle cyclic references. However, the bug occurs because the weak reference is not correctly maintained, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving a `NoneType` object instead of the intended `PeriodIndex` object.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is triggering this bug when trying to assert that all levels in the MultiIndex are monotonic, leading to an `AttributeError` pertaining to a `NoneType` not having the attribute 'view'.

The relevant runtime input values and types during the execution of the failing test show that the PeriodIndex contains two periods '2019Q1' and '2019Q2' as its values.

## Bug Cause
The bug arises due to improper handling of weak references in the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class. The weak reference to `self` is created but not correctly retrieved, leading to a `NoneType` object instead of an instance of `PeriodIndex`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, it is essential to ensure that the weak reference to `self` in the `_engine` function is maintained correctly. By properly handling the weak reference, we can ensure that the PeriodEngine receives a valid instance of `PeriodIndex` instead of a `NoneType`.

## Code Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(lambda: period(), len(self))
```

This fix ensures that the `period` weak reference is correctly invoked to retrieve the reference to `self` when creating the `PeriodEngine`, resolving the issue of receiving a `NoneType`.
