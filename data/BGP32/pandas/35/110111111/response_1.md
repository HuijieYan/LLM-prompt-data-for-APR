To fix the bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class, we need to ensure that the weak reference is maintained properly. The bug arises because the weak reference to `self` is lost before it can be utilized in the `_engine_type` call.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type
    return engine_type(period, len(self))
```

The corrected version maintains the reference to the `period` weak reference until it is used in the `_engine_type` function call. This change ensures that the weak reference remains valid during the operation, fixing the bug identified in the failing test.

By replacing the code with the corrected version provided above, the failing test should pass successfully, and the `AttributeError` related to `NoneType` should be resolved.
