To fix the bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `self` object is maintained properly. The error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` is receiving a `NoneType` object instead of the expected `PeriodIndex` object.

The cause of the bug lies in the `_engine` function where it tries to create a weak reference to `self` but doesn't maintain it correctly, leading to a loss of reference.

To fix this, we need to replace the weak reference line with a proper weak reference that retains the reference to `self` for the lifetime of the `_engine` object.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_weakref = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_weakref, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we ensure that the weak reference maintains a reference to the `self` object properly.

This correction should resolve the issue described in the GitHub bug report and pass the failing test case.
