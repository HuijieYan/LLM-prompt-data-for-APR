## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is causing an AttributeError when trying to access the attribute `view()` on a `NoneType` object.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` and then checks whether the levels are monotonic.
3. The error occurs in the test when trying to check the monotonicity of the levels.
4. The cause of the bug is related to weak references in the `_engine` function, causing a reference cycle issue and resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to ensure that the weak reference is correctly maintained throughout the execution.

## Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        if period() is None:
            raise ValueError("Weak reference to PeriodIndex is None.")
        return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

This fix includes a check to ensure that the weak reference `period()` is not `None` before passing it to the `_engine_type`. This check helps prevent the AttributeError caused by the weak reference not being maintained correctly.

By implementing this modification, the bug should be fixed, and the failing test should pass successfully.
