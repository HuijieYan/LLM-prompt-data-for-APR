## Identified Bug
The bug in the `_engine` function is caused by the weak reference `period` being referenced after it's dropped, resulting in a `NoneType` error when trying to access an attribute of the referenced object later in the test.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is maintained throughout the function. We can achieve this by storing the weak reference within the `self` object to prevent it from being garbage collected until needed.

## Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    self._weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._weak_period, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference as `self._weak_period`, we ensure that the reference remains valid as long as the `self` object is in scope. This correction should prevent the `NoneType` error encountered in the failing test.
