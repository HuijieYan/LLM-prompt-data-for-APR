## Fixing the Bug

### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The `_engine` function is supposed to return an instance of `PeriodEngine` initialized with a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance and its length. However, due to the weak reference creation process, the reference is getting lost, leading to an AttributeError when trying to access it later on, resulting in the failing test.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference keeps its reference to the `PeriodIndex`. This can be achieved by assigning the weak reference to a class attribute, which will persist as long as the class instance exists.

### Corrected Version
Below is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Assign the weak reference to a class attribute to preserve the reference
    self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference in the `self._period_ref` attribute, we ensure that the reference is maintained as long as the `PeriodIndex` instance exists.

This fix should address the bug and make the failing test pass by maintaining the weak reference appropriately.
