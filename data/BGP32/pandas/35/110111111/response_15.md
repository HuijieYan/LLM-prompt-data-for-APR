To fix the bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained properly. The current implementation is losing the reference prematurely, resulting in a `NoneType` error when accessing the engine in subsequent operations.

To resolve this issue, we need to modify the `_engine` function as follows:
1. Avoid using `weakref.ref(self)` directly within the return statement.
2. Store the weak reference as an instance variable to keep it alive.
3. Use the stored weak reference to create the engine when needed.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    self._weakref_period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._weakref_period, len(self))
```

With this modification, the weak reference to `self` is correctly stored as an instance variable, preventing premature deallocation. The subsequent access to the engine should now work fine without raising the `NoneType` error.

By applying this fix, the failing test should pass successfully, and the expected input/output values should align correctly, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
