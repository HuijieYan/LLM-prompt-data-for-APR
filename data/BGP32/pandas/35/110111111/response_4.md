## Bug Fixing Strategy
1. The error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` is receiving a `NoneType` when trying to access the view, causing an `AttributeError`.
2. The issue description on GitHub suggests that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is getting dropped before intended, leading to the `NoneType`.
3. To resolve this issue, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained throughout the lifetime of the `PeriodEngine`.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# The corrected buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By maintaining the weak reference to `self` in the `_engine` function, we ensure that the `PeriodIndex` object is not prematurely garbage collected, thereby resolving the `NoneType` issue encountered by the `PeriodEngine`.
