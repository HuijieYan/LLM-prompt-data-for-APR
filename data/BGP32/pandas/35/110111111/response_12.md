## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is returning `NoneType` instead of the expected `PeriodEngine`, causing an AttributeError.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is trying to check if the levels in the MultiIndex are monotonic, but due to the issue with `_engine`, it fails.
3. The error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` received a `NoneType` object, leading to an AttributeError in the `is_monotonic_increasing` method.
4. The bug seems to be caused by the weak reference handling in the `_engine` function, resulting in the deletion of the reference before it's intended.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is handled correctly in the `_engine` function so that the `PeriodEngine` receives the `PeriodIndex` object as expected.

## Bug Fixed Version
```python
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))()  # Use weak reference to get the actual object
```

By modifying the `_engine` function to utilize the weak reference correctly and retrieve the actual object from the weak reference, we can resolve the bug and make the failing test pass.
