To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained properly within the `_engine` function. The current implementation is losing the reference, leading to the error. We need to modify the `_engine` function to correctly handle the weak reference.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By maintaining the weak reference to `self` in the `period` variable, we ensure that the `PeriodIndex` object is not lost prematurely, avoiding the error caused by a `None` reference.

This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` passes as expected.
