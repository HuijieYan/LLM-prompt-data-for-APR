### Analyzing the Buggy Function and GitHub Issue
The buggy function `_engine` in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file is using a weak reference to self and passing it to `_engine_type`, but the issue reported on GitHub shows that when copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex, weak references are lost.

### Potential Error Locations
1. Weak reference creation might not be handled correctly.
2. Passing the weak reference to `_engine_type` might be causing the weak reference to be lost.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug seems to be caused by the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` being dropped prematurely or not being maintained through the copying process in the `MultiIndex`. This results in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained during the copying process of the `MultiIndex`. This can be done by adjusting the handling of weak references and ensuring they are correctly passed along.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Ensure a weak reference to self is maintained throughout the copying process
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    # Pass the weak reference to _engine_type
    def engine_type(period_ref, length):
        if period_ref is None:
            return None
        return self._engine_type(period_ref, length)
    
    return engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This revised version ensures that the weak reference `period` is properly used and maintained during the copying process to address the reported issue in GitHub.

By adjusting the function to handle weak references correctly and ensuring they are passed along as needed, the bug related to weakrefs in copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` should be resolved.
