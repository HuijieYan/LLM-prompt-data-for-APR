### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is supposed to return an instance of `self._engine_type` by passing a weak reference of `self` and the length of `self`, which is a PeriodIndex object. However, the weakness of the reference handling in the function could lead to losing the weak reference before it's intended.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The usage of `weakref.ref(self)` may not correctly maintain the weak reference.
2. The returned `self._engine_type` might not handle the weak reference as expected.

### Bug Cause:
The weak reference to `self` is being dropped too early, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` value instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `weakref.ref(self)` maintains the weak reference until it is passed to `self._engine_type`, preventing it from being dropped prematurely.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function in pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

By assigning the result of `weakref.ref(self)` to `period_ref` before passing it to `self._engine_type`, we ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly maintained until it is used by the `PeriodEngine`. This correction should address the issue reported on GitHub related to losing weakrefs on copying PeriodIndex levels in a MultiIndex.
