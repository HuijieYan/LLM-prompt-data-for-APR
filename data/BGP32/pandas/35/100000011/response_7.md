### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to avoid a reference cycle and create a weak reference to the `self` object. However, the issue reported on GitHub indicates that in the specific case of copying `PeriodIndex` levels on a `MultiIndex`, weakrefs are lost, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Potential error locations:
1. Weak referencing being lost during the creation of a new `MultiIndex`.
2. Potential issue with the `_engine_type` method when receiving a weakly referenced object.

### Cause of the bug:
The cause of the bug is likely related to the weak referencing being lost during the process of copying `PeriodIndex` levels on a `MultiIndex`. As a result, the `PeriodEngine` receives `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

### Fix strategy:
To resolve this bug, we need to ensure that weak referencing is maintained when creating a new `MultiIndex` from `PeriodIndex` levels. Additionally, the `_engine_type` method should handle weakly referenced objects properly to prevent receiving `None`.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if period() is not None else self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By checking if the weakly referenced `self` object is not `None` before passing it to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the weak reference is maintained properly, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
