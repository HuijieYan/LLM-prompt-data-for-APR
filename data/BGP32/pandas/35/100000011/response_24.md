### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` (a `PeriodIndex` instance) and then pass it to `self._engine_type` along with the length of `self`. However, the issue reported on GitHub indicates that the weak reference is being dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to get a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Weak reference creation.
2. Passing the weak reference to `_engine_type`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The weak reference created using `weakref.ref(self)` is not being held onto for as long as needed, leading to it being garbage collected prematurely. This results in `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the actual `PeriodIndex` instance.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until it is no longer needed. One way to achieve this is by storing the weak reference in a variable within the class, so it remains valid throughout the function's execution.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the _engine function

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)  # Store the weak reference in a variable
    return self._engine_type(period_weakref, len(self))
```

By storing the `period_weakref` variable within the function, we ensure that the weak reference remains valid until it is used by `self._engine_type`, thereby preventing premature garbage collection. This corrected version should address the issue reported on GitHub.
