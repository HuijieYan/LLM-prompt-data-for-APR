### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file is supposed to return the `PeriodEngine` with a weak reference to `self`. The issue on GitHub titled "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs" highlights the problem of weak reference loss when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on a `MultiIndex`, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The creation of the weak reference to `self` might not be stored correctly.
2. Passing the weak reference may not be handled properly within the `_engine_type` constructor.
3. Possible issue with storing the length of `self` within the weak reference.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the weak reference to `self` is not maintained correctly, and when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on a `MultiIndex`, the reference to the `PeriodIndex` becomes lost, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the weak reference to `self` is stored properly within the `_engine` function.
2. Verify that the weak reference is passed and used appropriately in the `_engine_type` constructor.
3. Check if the length of `self` is captured correctly within the weak reference.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference to self correctly
    period = weakref.ref(self)

    # Verify if self exists before passing to _engine_type
    if period() is not None:
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))

    # Handle the case where weak reference is lost
    raise RuntimeError("Weak reference to self is lost")
```

By adjusting the handling of the weak reference in the `_engine` function as shown above, we ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives the `PeriodIndex` as expected, thus resolving the issue described on GitHub.
