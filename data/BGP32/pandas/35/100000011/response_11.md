### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object (PeriodIndex) and then pass it to `_engine_type` to avoid reference cycles.
2. The issue mentioned on GitHub indicates that weak references are being lost when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`, leading to unexpected behavior.
3. Due to the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped prematurely, the `PeriodEngine` receives `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`, causing errors.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` (PeriodIndex) is maintained throughout the necessary operations, particularly when copying levels within a `MultiIndex`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# Corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))

# Additional method to ensure weakrefs are preserved during level copy
def _copy_with_weakrefs(self):
    weakref_self = weakref.ref(self)
    new_levels = [weakref_self() for level in self.levels]
    return self.__class__(levels=new_levels, codes=self.codes, name=self.name, dtype=self.dtype)
```

By adding the `_copy_with_weakrefs` method to preserve weak references during level copy, we ensure that `PeriodIndex` objects maintain their weakly referenced state even in `MultiIndex` operations. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
