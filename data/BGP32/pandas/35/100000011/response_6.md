### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference of the `self` object (which is an instance of a period index). However, it seems that the weak reference is not being used correctly when creating the `_engine_type`, which results in losing the weak reference.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The `weakref.ref(self)` is used without properly utilizing the weak reference later.
2. There might be an issue with passing the weak reference to `_engine_type`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to be dropped prematurely before it is used in the `_engine_type`, leading to the `_engine_type` receiving `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference created is maintained until it is used in `_engine_type`. This can be achieved by dereferencing the weak reference at the appropriate place in the `_engine` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By using `period()` where the weak reference is needed, we ensure that the `self` reference is correctly maintained until it is passed to `_engine_type`.

This correction should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug scenario "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs".
