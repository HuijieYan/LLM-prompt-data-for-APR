## Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is an instance of a class. However, the `weakref.ref` method is not being utilized correctly in this context, resulting in the weak reference not being preserved as intended.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The `period = weakref.ref(self)` line is incorrectly creating a weak reference to `self`.
2. The weak reference `period` is not being used correctly when calling `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by using `weakref.ref` incorrectly. The weak reference created is not being utilized properly, leading to `None` being received instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`. This causes the `_engine` function to fail in the intended functionality.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained and used correctly within the `_engine` function. This involves creating a weak reference to `self`, then passing this weak reference to the `_engine_type` constructor for proper usage.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)

    # Check if the weak reference is still alive
    if period() is not None:
        # Pass the weak reference to _engine_type
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        # Handle the case when the weak reference is no longer valid
        raise ValueError("Weak reference to self no longer exists")
```

By correcting the usage of `weakref.ref` and checking the weak reference's validity, the corrected `_engine` function should now properly handle weak referencing within the context of a `PeriodIndex` instance.
