### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is a cached read-only method that returns the engine type for the `PeriodIndex`. The function is supposed to create a weak reference to itself and pass it along with the length of the `PeriodIndex` to the `_engine_type` method.

The GitHub issue highlights a problem where weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` objects are being dropped prematurely, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Creation of weak reference using `weakref.ref(self)` may not be correctly retaining the reference.
2. Passing the weak reference `period` along with the length of `self` to `_engine_type` may not be working as intended.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to the premature dropping of weak references to `PeriodIndex` objects, causing `None` to be received by the `PeriodEngine`, leading to unexpected behavior as observed in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is correctly created and maintained until it is used by the `PeriodEngine`. Additionally, the weak reference should be passed correctly along with the length of `self` to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    # Retrieve the length of the PeriodIndex
    length = len(self)
    
    # Pass the weak reference and length to _engine_type method
    return self._engine_type(period, length)
```

By making sure that the weak reference is properly retained and passed along with the length of the `PeriodIndex` to the `_engine_type` method, the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
