### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object, a `PeriodIndex` instance. However, the bug occurs when the weak reference `period` is accessed within the `_engine_type` constructor. Due to the weak reference mechanism, `self` might get garbage collected before the `_engine_type` is called, resulting in `None` being passed instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

### Error Location:
The error occurs because the weak reference to `self` is not held strongly enough to prevent `self` from being garbage collected before being accessed in `_engine_type`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The weak reference created in the `_engine` function allows the PeriodIndex to be garbage collected prematurely, leading to the None value being passed to `_engine_type`, causing unexpected behavior.

### Fix Strategy:
To address this issue, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` remains valid throughout the execution of `_engine_type`. This can be achieved by holding a strong reference to `self` in the `_engine` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Hold a strong reference to self to prevent premature garbage collection
    period = self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By holding a strong reference to `self` within the `_engine` function, we prevent the premature garbage collection of the `PeriodIndex` instance, thereby ensuring that the intended `PeriodIndex` is passed to the `_engine_type` constructor as expected.
