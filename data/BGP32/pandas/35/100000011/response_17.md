### Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `_engine` function in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file. The function is meant to return an instance of an engine type with a weak reference to the `self` object passed to it. However, due to the implementation issue, the weak reference is not being utilized correctly, causing unexpected behavior in the program.

### Error Location:
The primary issue is with how the weak reference to the `self` object is being created and passed to the `_engine_type`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the weak reference not being created properly and not being utilized as intended. This leads to the `_engine_type` function receiving a reference to `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex` object, resulting in unexpected behavior when accessing `idx2.levels`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly create a weak reference to the `self` object and pass it to the `_engine_type` function so that it receives the actual `PeriodIndex` object. This will ensure that the weak reference is maintained and prevent the reference cycle issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    # Call _engine_type with the weak reference and the length of self
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we create a weak reference using `weakref.ref(self)` and then invoke the weak reference using `period()`. This ensures that the `_engine_type` function receives the actual `PeriodIndex` object, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
