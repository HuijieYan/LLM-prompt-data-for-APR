### Analysis:
The `BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs` issue describes a problem where weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` objects are dropped before they should be. This results in the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`, causing errors when checking for monotonicity.

### Potential error locations:
1. The weak reference creation using `weakref.ref(self)` might not be storing the reference properly.
2. There could be an issue with the way the weak reference is passed to `_engine_type`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is not maintained correctly, causing it to be dropped prematurely. This results in the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex` object.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is correctly maintained throughout the function. This will ensure that the `PeriodIndex` object is not garbage collected prematurely.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    def create_weakref():
        return weakref.ref(self)
        
    period = create_weakref()
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

In the corrected version, a function `create_weakref` is defined to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object. This function is called to obtain the weak reference instead of directly creating it. This ensures that the weak reference is valid when passed to `_engine_type`.

This correction should resolve the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
