### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file is meant to create a weak reference to the `self` object (which is a `Period` index) and pass it to the `_engine_type` constructor. The bug occurs when the weak reference `period` is not being used correctly, leading to the `PeriodEngine` constructor receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

### Identified Error:
The incorrect usage of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `Period` index is the main cause of the bug. The `period` variable is created but not accessed properly when passed to the `_engine_type` constructor, resulting in a `None` being used instead of the intended reference.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the weak reference `period` needs to be correctly dereferenced before being passed to the `_engine_type` constructor. This involves accessing the actual object using the `()` operator on the weak reference before passing it to the constructor.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By applying this correction, the weak reference `period` is now correctly dereferenced before being passed to the `_engine_type` constructor, ensuring that the `PeriodEngine` receives the intended `PeriodIndex` object.
