### Analysis:
1. The `@cache_readonly` decorator is used on the `_engine` function, indicating that the function's result is cached and should be read-only.
2. The function is creating a weak reference to `self` (presumably a `PeriodIndex` object) and passing it to `_engine_type` along with the length of the `PeriodIndex`.

### Error Location:
The potential error lies in the creation and passing of the weak reference to `self`. If the weak reference is not correctly handled, it may lead to the issue described in the GitHub bug report.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is related to the improper handling of weak references in the `_engine` function. When using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, if the weak reference is not properly maintained, it may result in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the actual `PeriodIndex`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, make sure the weak reference to `self` is properly maintained and valid when passed to the `_engine_type`. Ensure that the weak reference remains alive for the duration it is needed within the `_engine` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `weakref.proxy(self)` is used instead of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference that does not need to be explicitly dereferenced and remains valid for the duration required by `_engine_type`. This should address the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
