### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`.
2. The issue described on GitHub is related to weakrefs being lost in certain scenarios involving copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`.
3. The bug causes the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to be dropped before intended, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and address the GitHub issue, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained throughout the required operation, preventing it from being dropped prematurely. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference to `self` within the `_engine` function itself and appropriately handling it.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

def _engine(self):
    # Store a weakref of self to avoid reference cycle
    weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    def engine_type_callback(weak_ref):
        # Retrieve the weakly referenced object
        period_obj = weak_ref()
        if period_obj is not None:
            return self._engine_type(period_obj, len(period_obj))
    
    return engine_type_callback(weak_period)
```

By storing the weak reference within the nested function `engine_type_callback` and checking if the `PeriodIndex` object is still valid before passing it to `_engine_type`, we ensure that weakrefs are not lost prematurely. This corrected version should address the bug and provide the expected output described in the GitHub issue.
