### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is using a `weakref` on `self` (a `PeriodIndex` instance) to avoid reference cycles. However, due to the bug, when the `period` is created as a weak reference, the reference count is not being retained properly, leading to the weak reference being dropped prematurely.

### Identified Error Location:
The main issue lies in the line:
```python
period = weakref.ref(self)
```
where the `period` variable is assigned the weak reference of `self`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is that the weak reference created on `self` in the `_engine` function is not being retained correctly. As a result, the weak reference is lost before its intended use, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, the weak reference of `self` needs to be stored in a persistent way to ensure that the reference is retained until it is used. One approach can be to store the weak reference in an instance attribute of the `PeriodIndex` object, rather than just a local variable in the `_engine` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    if not hasattr(self, '_weak_period'):
        self._weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._weak_period, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference in the instance attribute `_weak_period`, the reference count is properly maintained, ensuring that the weak reference is not dropped prematurely. This corrected version should address the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
