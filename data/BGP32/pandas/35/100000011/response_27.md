### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` in `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` is meant to return an instance of `self._engine_type` with a weak reference to `self`. However, the issue mentioned on GitHub suggests that copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` leads to weak refs being lost.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Creating a weak reference to `self` using `weakref.ref(self)` might not be handled correctly.
2. Passing this weak reference to `self._engine_type` could be causing the weak references to be lost during the copying process.

### Cause of the Bug:
The weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before it is intended to be used, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This results in the unexpected behavior described in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained throughout the process of copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`. This can be achieved by carefully handling how the weak reference is created and passed to `self._engine_type`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self), name=self.name)
```

In the corrected version, the weak reference `period` is passed with additional arguments to `self._engine_type`, ensuring that the weak reference remains available during the process of copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`. This change should address the issue raised on GitHub.
