### Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `_engine` function in the `pandas.core.indexes.period` module. The function is supposed to create and return an instance of the `_engine_type` class, passing a weak reference of `self` (a PeriodIndex object) as an argument. However, the implementation is incorrect, resulting in weakrefs being lost, causing unexpected behavior when the `_engine` function is used.

### Identified Error Location:
The issue lies in how the weak reference is created and passed to `_engine_type` in the `_engine` function.

### Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is that the weak reference is incorrectly created using `weakref.ref(self)`, which is not sufficient to maintain the weak reference throughout the function's scope. As a result, when the `_engine_type` is called, it receives `None` instead of the expected PeriodIndex object.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained properly until it is used in the `_engine_type` call. This can be achieved by using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)` to create the weak reference.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use weakref.proxy to maintain the weak reference
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By making this change, the correct weak reference to `self` will be passed to `_engine_type`, preserving the intended behavior and fixing the bug described in the GitHub issue.
