1. The buggy function `_engine` is using a weak reference to the `self` object (which is a PeriodIndex) to avoid reference cycles. However, in the provided code snippet, the weak reference is not being properly passed to `_engine_type`, resulting in potential weak reference issues.

2. The potential error location is when creating the weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)`. Ensuring that this weak reference is correctly passed to `_engine_type` will be crucial for resolving the bug.

3. The bug is likely causing weak references to be lost before intended, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex. This affects the behavior of the PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex objects, as highlighted in the GitHub issue.

4. To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly passed to `_engine_type` to avoid losing the weak reference prematurely. This will ensure that the PeriodEngine receives the intended PeriodIndex instead of None.

5. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

This corrected version passes the weak reference `period()` (which is the actual object referred to) to `_engine_type` instead of just the weak reference itself. By providing the correct object, we ensure that the PeriodEngine receives the actual PeriodIndex object rather than None.
