### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` incorrectly. Instead of passing `self` to `weakref.ref`, it should be passing an instance of the class that creates the weak reference, which in this case should be `PeriodIndex`. This bug is causing the weak reference to be lost, leading to unexpected behavior as described in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by passing `self` directly to `weakref.ref` instead of passing an instance of the `PeriodIndex` class. This results in the weak reference being created to the wrong object and subsequently lost.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to create a weak reference to an instance of the `PeriodIndex` class instead of directly to `self` in the `_engine` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of an instance of PeriodIndex to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(type(self))(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By creating a weak reference to an instance of the `PeriodIndex` class, the corrected version of the `_engine` function will maintain the weak reference properly and resolve the issue described in the GitHub report.
