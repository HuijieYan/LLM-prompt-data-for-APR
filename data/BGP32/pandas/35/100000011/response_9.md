### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference of the `Period` object. This is used to avoid a reference cycle. However, in the GitHub issue mentioned, it's pointed out that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped prematurely, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This leads to unexpected behavior as described in the GitHub issue.

### Error Location:
The issue seems to be in the implementation of weak referencing in the `_engine` function. The weak reference of `period` needs to be preserved until after it is used by `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the premature dropping of the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex`. This causes the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the actual `PeriodIndex`, leading to unexpected behavior as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference of the `Period` object is maintained until it is used by the `PeriodEngine`. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference in a variable within the `_engine` function to prevent it from being prematurely dropped.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    period_ref = period  # Store the weak reference to prevent it from being prematurely dropped
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
``` 

By storing the weak reference in `period_ref`, we ensure that the `PeriodIndex` is available for `PeriodEngine` usage. This correction should address the issue reported on GitHub.
