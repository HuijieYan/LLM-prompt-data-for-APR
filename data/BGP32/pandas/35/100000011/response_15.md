**Analysis:**
The buggy function `_engine` in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file is causing an issue related to losing weakrefs when copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex, as described in the GitHub issue "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs." The issue arises because the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is dropped before the PeriodEngine receives it, leading to a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

**Error Locations:**
The issue lies in the creation and retention of a weakref for the `self` object in the `_engine` method. The `period = weakref.ref(self)` statement only creates a weak reference but does not preserve it, leading to it being garbage collected before it is used in `_engine_type`.

**Cause of the Bug:**
The bug occurs because the `period` weak reference is not maintained throughout the `_engine` method's execution, which results in `self` being dereferenced prematurely and passed as None to `_engine_type`.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` remains valid until it is accessed in the `_engine_type` method. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference in a variable with a broader scope or capturing it in a closure to prevent premature garbage collection.

**Corrected Version:**
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Capture the weak reference to self in a local variable
    period = weakref.ref(self)

    def create_engine(period_ref):
        return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
    
    # Pass the captured weak reference to the inner function
    return create_engine(period)
```

By maintaining the weak reference in a broader scope and passing it to an inner function, we ensure that it remains valid until the `_engine_type` method is invoked, fixing the bug related to losing weakrefs in the MultiIndex scenario.
