### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to the `self` object, which is a PeriodIndex instance. The weak reference is then passed to the `_engine_type` method along with the length of the PeriodIndex. However, in the buggy implementation, the weak reference is not being correctly utilized which results in the weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped prematurely.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Improper usage of `weakref.ref`.
2. Potential issue with the invocation of `_engine_type` method.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to the premature dropping of the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object created using `weakref.ref(self)`. This leads to `_engine_type` receiving None instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`, causing the issue reported in the GitHub problem description.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug:
1. Ensure that the weak reference created using `weakref.ref` is used correctly.
2. Make sure that the weak reference is maintained until it is properly used by `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to the PeriodIndex instance
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    # Retrieve the weakly referenced object and check if it's still available
    period_obj = period()
    if period_obj is None:
        raise RuntimeError("Weakly referenced object not available.")
    
    # Pass the weak reference to _engine_type along with the length
    return self._engine_type(period_obj, len(self))
```

By properly using the weak reference created, checking its availability, and passing it to `_engine_type`, the corrected version of the function should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub problem description.
