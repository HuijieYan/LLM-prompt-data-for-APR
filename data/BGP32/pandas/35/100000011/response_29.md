### Analysis:
The bug in the `_engine` function is causing the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to be dropped prematurely, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This leads to the issue described on GitHub where copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` loses weakrefs.

### Error Locations:
1. The `period` variable is incorrectly assigned as a `weakref.ref(self)`, which is causing the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to be dropped too early.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the premature dropping of the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` before it is intended to be used by the `PeriodEngine`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
We need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is retained until it is used by the `PeriodEngine`. This can be achieved by modifying the way the weak reference is created and accessed.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Correctly create a weak reference to the self object
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, we create a weak reference to `self` without the premature dropping issue. This corrected version retains the weak reference until it is used by the `PeriodEngine`, resolving the bug.
