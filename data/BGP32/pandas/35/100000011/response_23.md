### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is responsible for returning an instance of an engine type based on the current object (`self`). The issue reported on GitHub indicates that weak references to `PeriodIndex` levels in a `MultiIndex` are lost when copying, resulting in `None` being passed to the `PeriodEngine` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The weak reference creation `period = weakref.ref(self)` might be causing the issue.
2. Passing `period` weak reference to `_engine_type` might not be maintaining the weak reference as expected.

### Bug Cause:
The weak reference created in the `_engine` function is not maintained properly, leading to the loss of the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` levels when copying a `MultiIndex`.

### Fix Strategy:
To resolve the issue, the weak reference must be maintained properly throughout the copying process to ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives the correct `PeriodIndex`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    def engine_type_wrapper(obj, length):
        return self._engine_type(period, length)
    
    return engine_type_wrapper
```

By modifying the function to return an inner function (`engine_type_wrapper`) that captures the weak reference `period` and the length parameter, we can ensure that the weak reference is maintained until the engine type is actually created. This revision should address the issue reported on GitHub.
