### Analysis:
The issue reported on GitHub describes a problem where copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` loses weak references. The function `_engine` in the code is responsible for creating a weak reference to `self` and passing it to `_engine_type`. However, the issue arises from the weak reference being dropped prematurely, resulting in `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of `PeriodIndex`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the premature dropping of the weak reference `period` before it is intended to be used by `PeriodEngine`. This results in passing `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

### Fixing Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until it is used by `PeriodEngine`. One way to do this is by moving the weak reference creation inside the `_engine_type` function, so it stays alive until it's actually needed.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Define a function to create weak reference inside _engine_type
    def create_weakref():
        return weakref.ref(self)
        
    return self._engine_type(create_weakref, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, the weak reference creation is deferred until it is needed in the `_engine_type` function. This ensures that the weak reference is maintained until it's properly utilized, resolving the issue of losing weak references when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`.
