### Analysis:
The bug originates from the `_engine` function in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file. The function is responsible for creating a weak reference to the `self` object (PeriodIndex) and passing it to `_engine_type`. However, due to the weak reference handling, the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object is dropped prematurely.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Weak reference implementation.
2. Passing weak reference object to _engine_type method.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the weak reference created in the `_engine` function is not being used correctly, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving None instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is handled properly and is not prematurely dropped. This can be achieved by maintaining a strong reference to the weak reference object until it is safely used in the `_engine_type` method.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))()
```

In the corrected version, by adding the `()` after `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, we ensure that the weak reference is correctly handled and that the `PeriodEngine` object receives the intended `PeriodIndex` without being None.

This correction will resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to the copying of `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` losing weak references.
