The bug in the provided function is that it is passing a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type` instead of passing `self` directly. This can cause the weak reference to become invalid before being used, resulting in unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to pass `self` directly to `_engine_type`. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

With this fix, the function will correctly pass `self` to `_engine_type` without using a weak reference. This ensures that `self` remains valid during the function call, addressing the bug in the original code.
