## Fixing the bug

The bug in the `_engine` function arises from passing a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type` instead of the actual `self`. This results in incorrect behavior when creating an engine object based on the weak reference.

To fix this bug, we need to store a strong reference to `self` before creating the weak reference. This ensures that `self` is retained during the `_engine` function's execution.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a strong reference to self
    period = self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By storing a strong reference to `self` in the `period` variable, we ensure that the engine object is created using the actual `self`, satisfying the expected input/output values.
