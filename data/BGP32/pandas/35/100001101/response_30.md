The issue in the buggy function lies in the creation of a weak reference to self, which is not being properly utilized when calling `_engine_type`. This can lead to memory leaks and potential reference cycle problems.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `_engine` function to correctly use the weak reference to self when calling `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By dereferencing the weak reference `period` using `()` when passing it to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the actual `PeriodIndex` object is used, preventing any reference cycle issues.

This should fix the bug and the function should now work correctly as expected.
