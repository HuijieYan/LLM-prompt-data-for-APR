## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` uses `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference of `self`, which is then passed to `_engine_type` to create an engine object. However, the bug lies in the fact that the weak reference is not being dereferenced properly before passing it to `_engine_type`, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs because `weakref.ref(self)` returns a weak reference object, not the referenced object itself. Therefore, passing this weak reference to `_engine_type` results in unexpected behavior.

## Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to dereference the weak reference object before passing it to `_engine_type`. We can achieve this by calling the `weakref` object as a function (`period()`) to retrieve the referenced object.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
