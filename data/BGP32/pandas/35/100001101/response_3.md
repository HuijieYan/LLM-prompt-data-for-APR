## Analysis
In the provided buggy function, the `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is the `PeriodIndex` object. This weak reference is then passed to the `_engine_type` function along with the length of `self`. The issue here is that when creating a weak reference using `weakref.ref`, the actual object needs to be accessed via the weak reference to prevent it from being garbage collected prematurely.

## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_engine` function arises from the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref`. Instead of accessing the object through the weak reference, the function directly passes the weak reference to `_engine_type`. This results in the premature garbage collection of `self`, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to dereference the weak reference to access the actual object before passing it to `_engine_type`. By doing this, we ensure that the `PeriodIndex` object is still accessible and not garbage collected prematurely.

## Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

In the corrected version, `period()` dereferences the weak reference to access the `self` object before passing it to `_engine_type`. This ensures that the `PeriodIndex` object is properly maintained throughout the function's execution.
