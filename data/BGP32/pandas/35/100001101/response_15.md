## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is supposed to return an instance of `self._engine_type` with a weak reference to `self`. However, the issue lies in how the weak reference is created. The `weakref.ref()` function returns a weak reference object, not the actual object itself. This causes the `_engine` function to return a weak reference object instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`. 

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function is returning a weak reference object instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we need to dereference the weak reference object and return the actual `PeriodIndex` object. This can be achieved by calling the weak reference object to retrieve the actual object. 

## The corrected version
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

By calling `period()` instead of just `period`, we are retrieving the actual `PeriodIndex` object from the weak reference, fixing the bug.
