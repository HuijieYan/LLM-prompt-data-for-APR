The bug in the given function `_engine` is that it is creating a weak reference to `self` but not dereferencing it correctly when passing it to `_engine_type`. This leads to unexpected behavior and causes the tests to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to dereference the weak reference `period` before using it to create the `_engine_type` instance.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By dereferencing the weak reference `period` with `()` before passing it to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the original object `self` is correctly used in creating the `_engine_type` instance.

This corrected version should now satisfy the expected input/output values provided.
