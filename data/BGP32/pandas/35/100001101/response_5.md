The bug in the `_engine` function lies in the use of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`. The `weakref.ref` function should be called with the object itself, not a reference to it. 

To fix this bug, we need to modify the line `period = weakref.ref(self)` to `period = weakref.ref(self)()` in order to correctly create a weak reference to the `self` object.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this change, the function should now correctly use the weak reference to `self` and return the expected output for all test cases.
