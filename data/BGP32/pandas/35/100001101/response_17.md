The issue in the buggy function is that it is using weakref incorrectly. The correct way to use weakref in this context is to create a weak reference to the object and then retrieve the object back from the weak reference when needed. 

In the buggy function, the weak reference is created to `self`, but then it's directly passed to `_engine_type` without actually retrieving the object back before passing it as an argument. This results in passing a weak reference object instead of the actual object, causing the function to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to retrieve the object back from the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    # Retrieve the actual object from the weak reference
    period = period_weakref()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the function will correctly retrieve the object from the weak reference and pass it to `_engine_type`, satisfying the expected input/output values.
