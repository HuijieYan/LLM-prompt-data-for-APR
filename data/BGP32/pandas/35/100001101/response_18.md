The bug in the provided function is that it is creating a weak reference to `self` but not using it correctly when calling `_engine_type`. This leads to the weak reference being deleted before its intended use, causing unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, we should dereference the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`. This ensures that the reference to `self` remains valid during the call to `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` when passing it to `_engine_type`, we are dereferencing the weak reference and obtaining the actual `self` object. This ensures that the `self` object remains valid during the call, resolving the bug.

This correction aligns with the expected input/output values provided for the function.
