The bug in the provided function is due to the use of weakref.ref() incorrectly. The weakref.ref() function returns a weak reference object which should be accessed using the object() method to get the original object. In this case, the weak reference to 'self' is not being accessed properly when passed to _engine_type.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to correctly access the weak reference object before passing it to _engine_type. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By adding the '()' after the weakref.ref(self), we are now actually accessing the original object referred to by the weak reference.

With this correction, the function should now correctly use the weak reference of 'self' and return the expected values based on the provided test cases.
