The bug in the provided function is that `weakref.ref(self)` is being assigned to the variable `period` but not being used anywhere in the subsequent code. This causes the weak reference to `self` to be lost and not properly passed to `_engine_type`. As a result, there is a reference cycle that is not being broken correctly.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is actually used when calling `_engine_type`. We should pass the weak reference object itself, not just the result of calling `weakref.ref(self)`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By correctly passing the weak reference `period` to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the reference cycle is properly managed, preventing memory leaks and potential issues related to cyclic references.
