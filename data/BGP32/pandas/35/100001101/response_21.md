The issue with the buggy function is that it is incorrectly creating a weak reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This weak reference is not necessary and is causing the function to return an incorrect value.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the weak reference creation and directly pass `self` to `_engine_type`. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

With this correction, the function will correctly return the expected values for the given input parameters.
