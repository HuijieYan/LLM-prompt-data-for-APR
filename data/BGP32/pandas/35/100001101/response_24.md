The bug in the given function lies in the line where `period` is assigned a weak reference to `self`. The issue is that the `_engine_type` function is expecting `self` directly, not a weak reference to it. This creates a problem when `_engine_type` is called with `period` as an argument instead of `self`.

To fix this issue, we should modify the line where `period` is defined to directly pass `self` to `_engine_type` without using a weak reference.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

With this modification, the function will correctly pass `self` as an argument to `_engine_type` and resolve the bug that was causing the issue.
