The bug in the provided function lies in the way weak references are being used. The weakref.ref function creates a weak reference to the object passed to it, which may not be what is intended in this case. Instead of creating a weak reference to 'self', the intention seems to be to pass 'self' as an argument to '_engine_type'.

To fix this bug, we need to directly pass 'self' to '_engine_type' without using weak references.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

This corrected function simply passes 'self' as an argument to '_engine_type' without creating a weak reference to it. This ensures that the 'self' object is correctly passed to '_engine_type' as intended.
