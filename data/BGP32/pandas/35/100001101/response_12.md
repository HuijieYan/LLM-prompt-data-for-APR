The issue in the buggy function lies in how the weak reference object is being created. Instead of using `weakref.ref(self)`, we should use `weakref.proxy(self)` to create a weak reference proxy object that does not hold a strong reference to the original object.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the modified file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we ensure that the weak reference proxy object does not hold a strong reference to the `self` object, preventing potential reference cycles. This change should fix the bug and allow the function to work correctly with the expected input/output values provided.
