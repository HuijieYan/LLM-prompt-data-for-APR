The bug in the provided function `_engine` lies in the creation of the weak reference to `self`. The current implementation is using `weakref.ref(self)` which returns a weak reference object, not the actual reference to `self`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the line `period = weakref.ref(self)` to `period = weakref.proxy(self)`. This change ensures that `period` is a weak reference proxy to `self`, enabling access to the actual object.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly use a weak reference proxy to `self` and generate the expected output based on the provided test cases.
