The bug in the provided function is that it is using `weakref.ref` incorrectly. The `weakref.ref` function returns a weak reference object, not the actual reference to the object itself. Therefore, when passing `period` as an argument to `_engine_type`, it is actually passing a weak reference object instead of the expected reference to `self`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the way we create the weak reference object. We should use `weakref.proxy` instead, which returns a proxy to the object that allows access to the object attributes as if it were a direct reference.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use weakref.proxy instead of weakref.ref
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, we ensure that the actual reference to `self` is passed to `_engine_type`, satisfying the expected input/output values for the function.
