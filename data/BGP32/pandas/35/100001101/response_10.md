The bug in the `_engine` function is that `weakref.ref` is being used incorrectly. The `weakref.ref` function creates a weak reference to the object provided as an argument, but the correct way to access the original object from the weak reference is by calling the weak reference object itself. 

To fix this bug, you should modify the `_engine` function to correctly obtain the original object from the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By using `period()` instead of just `period`, we are accessing the original object from the weak reference.

This correction should address the issue and produce the expected output values for the given test cases.
