The bug in the provided function is that it is trying to create a weak reference to `self` incorrectly. 

To fix this bug, we need to create a weak reference to the actual object that `self` is referencing. One way to achieve this is by creating a weak reference to the underlying array of `self._values`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self._values to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self._values)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly create a weak reference to the `self._values` object. This will prevent any circular reference issues and the function should now work as intended based on the expected input/output values provided.
