The issue in the buggy function `_engine` lies in how `weakref.ref` is used to create a weak reference to `self`. The correct approach is to pass `self` directly to `_engine_type` after creating a weak reference, rather than passing the weak reference itself.

To fix the bug:
1. Create a weak reference to `self` using `weakref.ref(self)`.
2. Pass `self` directly to `_engine_type` after creating the weak reference.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

With this correction, the `_engine` function now correctly creates a weak reference to `self` and passes `self` directly to `_engine_type`, fixing the issue with the original implementation.
