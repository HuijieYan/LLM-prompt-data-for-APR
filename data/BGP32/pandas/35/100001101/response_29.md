The bug in the provided function `_engine` is that it incorrectly tries to create a weak reference to `self` by using `weakref.ref(self)` and then passing it to `_engine_type`, which is not the correct way to handle weak references in this context. Instead, we should directly pass `self` to `_engine_type` and let it internally handle weak references if necessary.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the attempt to create a weak reference and directly pass `self` to `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By making this change, the function will correctly return the expected values for the given input parameters.
