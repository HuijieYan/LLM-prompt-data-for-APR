The bug in the given function `_engine` is that it is incorrectly creating a weak reference to `self` and passing it to `_engine_type` instead of passing `self` directly. This results in a weak reference object being passed where a strong reference is expected, causing unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, we should simply pass `self` directly to `_engine_type` instead of creating a weak reference.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

With this correction, the function now correctly passes the `self` object to `_engine_type` without creating a weak reference, ensuring expected behavior.

This fix addresses the issue identified in the bug and should satisfy the expected input/output values.
