The bug in the provided function is that it incorrectly tries to create a weak reference to `self` using `weakref.ref()`. This does not work as intended because `weakref.ref()` is used to create a weak reference to an object, not to the calling function. To fix this, we need to directly pass `self` to `_engine_type` without creating a weak reference.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self._values, len(self))
```

Explanation:
- The buggy function incorrectly attempts to create a weak reference to `self`, which results in an incorrect behavior.
- The correct approach is to pass `self._values` as the first argument to `_engine_type` and `len(self)` as the second argument, which matches the expected behavior of the function.

By making this change, the function should now correctly return the expected output based on the provided input values.
