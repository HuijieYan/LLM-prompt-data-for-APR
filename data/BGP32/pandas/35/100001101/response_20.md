The issue in the provided buggy function is that it is creating a weak reference `period` to `self`, but it is not dereferencing this weak reference when passing it to `_engine_type`. This results in `_engine_type` receiving a weak reference instead of the actual object, causing unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to dereference the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`. We can achieve this by calling `period()`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` before passing it to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the actual object referenced by the weak reference is passed instead of the weak reference itself. This change should now correctly satisfy the expected input/output values.

Please ensure to replace the buggy function in the specified file with this corrected version.
