The issue in the buggy function lies in how the weak reference is being created. Using `weakref.ref(self)` is not the correct way to create a weak reference to the object `self`. This results in `period` being a callable weak reference object instead of a weak reference to the `self` object.

To fix this issue, we should use `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object and then call the weak reference to get the actual reference to the object before passing it to `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    # Get the actual reference to self
    period = period_ref()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This corrected version ensures that `period` contains the actual reference to the object `self`, satisfying the expected input/output values.
