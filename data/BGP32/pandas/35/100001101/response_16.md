# Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

## Explanation:
The bug in the original function is that when creating a weak reference to `self`, it was not being dereferenced properly before passing it to `_engine_type`. This would result in an incorrect reference to `self` being used in `_engine_type`. The corrected version of the function explicitly calls `period()` to dereference the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`.

By making this change, the function will correctly pass the dereferenced object to `_engine_type` with the expected `PeriodIndex` object and `PeriodArray` values, satisfying the expected input/output values.
