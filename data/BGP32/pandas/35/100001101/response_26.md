The bug in the provided function `_engine` lies in the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref(self)`. Instead of creating a weak reference to the object `self`, `period` is assigned the `weakref.ref` method itself, which results in an incorrect weak reference object being passed to `_engine_type`.

To fix this bug, we need to create a weak reference to the object `self` correctly. Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `period` is created as a weak reference object to `self`, and when invoking `period` with parentheses `()`, it returns the original object that the weak reference refers to. This change ensures that the correct object is passed to `_engine_type`.

By making this adjustment, the function should now correctly return the expected values for the given input parameters and satisfy the test cases.
