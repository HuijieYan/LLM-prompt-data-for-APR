The bug in the provided function lies in the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`. The `weakref.ref` function returns a weak reference object, not the actual object itself. So when the function `_engine` tries to use `period`, it is actually referring to the weak reference object, not the original `self`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to properly extract the original object from the weak reference. We can achieve this by calling the weak reference object `period` with an empty argument `()` to retrieve the original `self` object.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` instead of `period`, we are retrieving the original `self` object from the weak reference object.

This fix ensures that the function correctly receives the original `self` object, allowing it to operate as intended and avoiding the reference cycle issue.
