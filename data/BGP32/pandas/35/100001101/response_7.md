## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` incorrectly by passing `self` as an argument, which leads to a reference cycle issue. Instead, it should be passing the actual object to `weakref.ref` to avoid this problem.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by passing `self` directly to `weakref.ref`, which creates a reference cycle issue and can lead to memory leaks.

## Fix Strategy
Pass the actual object (in this case, `self`) to `weakref.ref` to avoid creating a reference cycle.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Pass the actual object (self) to avoid reference cycle
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
