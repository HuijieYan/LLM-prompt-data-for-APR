The issue in the provided buggy function lies in the way the weak reference to the `self` parameter is being handled, leading to an AttributeError at runtime. The `_engine` function is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, where `period` is created as a weak reference to `self`. However, due to the weak reference nature, the reference might be lost before it's used by the engine, causing the `NoneType` error.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` remains active until it's used in `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Keep a strong reference to self until used
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we maintain a strong reference to `period`, ensuring that `self` is still available when needed by the `_engine_type`.

With this modification, the function should now properly handle the weak reference and resolve the AttributeError issue identified in the failing test case.
