The buggy function `_engine` is failing due to the fact that it creates a weak reference to `self`, which is a `PeriodIndex`, and then tries to use this weak reference to construct an `engine`. The actual issue arises during the runtime execution where the `PeriodEngine` is trying to access this weak reference, causing an `AttributeError` due to a `'NoneType'` object being referenced.

The root cause of the bug can be traced to the use of weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` in the `_engine` function. When the `PeriodEngine` tries to access this weak reference to construct the final object, it fails to find a valid reference, leading to the `'NoneType'` object error.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is correctly utilized by keeping a strong reference to the object being referenced. One approach would be to modify the `_engine` function to store the weak reference and then return the object by accessing the weak reference followed by the use of the `referent` property to enforce a strong reference.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a weak reference of self and maintain a strong reference
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    period = period_ref()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By making the above change, the `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` call will now have a valid reference, resolving the `'NoneType'` object issue, and allowing the function to run as expected.
