## Analysis
1. The `PeriodIndex` is losing weak reference when being copied, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `NoneType` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.
2. The error occurs when calling `view("i8")` on a `NoneType` object.
3. This bug seems to be due to the weak reference handling within the `_engine` method which is returning a weak reference to `self` but the weak reference not being maintained correctly in the copying process.
4. To fix the bug, the weak reference needs to be handled properly so that it is not lost during the copying process.

## Correction
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self), self)
```

By passing `self` alongside the weak reference in the `_engine_type` call, we ensure that the weak reference is maintained and does not get lost during the copying process.

This correction should fix the bug and ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives the proper `PeriodIndex` object instead of a `NoneType`.
