Based on the provided information, the bug in the `_engine` function of the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file is causing the `is_monotonic` check to fail in the test case `test_get_level_values_when_periods` from `pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py`.

### Bug Analysis:
- The `_engine` function returns the result of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.
- In the failing test, a `PeriodIndex` object is passed to the `MultiIndex.from_arrays` function.
- The `MultiIndex` then uses this `PeriodIndex` object to create a new `idx2` MultiIndex by calling `_get_level_values` for each level.

The error occurs because the weak references are not handled correctly, leading to a `NoneType` object that causes the `AttributeError` when the `is_monotonic` check tries to access `self._engine`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address this issue, the weak reference should be used properly to ensure that the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained throughout the `MultiIndex` operations. This can be achieved by correctly passing the weak reference to `_engine_type` in the `_engine()` function.

### Corrected Version of the `_engine` Function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self), self)
```

By passing `self` along with the weak reference to `_engine_type`, the bug related to losing the weakref is fixed, ensuring the proper handling of the `PeriodIndex` object.

This corrected version should resolve the `AttributeError` caused by the incorrect handling of weak references, allowing the is_monotonic check to pass successfully in the failing test.
