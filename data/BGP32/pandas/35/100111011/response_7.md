### Identify the bug
The bug in the `_engine` function is related to how the weak reference to `self` is handled. In this case, the weak reference is stored in the variable `period`, but then not used correctly when creating the `_engine_type`. This leads to the `_engine_type` receiving `None` instead of a valid reference, causing the AttributeError in the failing test.

### Fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly utilized when calling `_engine_type`. This can be achieved by dereferencing the weak reference using `period()` before passing it to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

### Summary
In the original buggy function, the weak reference to `self` was not properly utilized when calling `_engine_type`, leading to an AttributeError due to a `NoneType`. By dereferencing the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the proper reference is passed, fixing the bug.
