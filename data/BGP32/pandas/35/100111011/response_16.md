Based on the information provided, the bug seems to stem from the `_engine` function in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file. The function is not correctly handling weak references, leading to an AttributeError when accessing the `view` attribute.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is causing the `_engine` function to return `None`, resulting in the AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute. This behavior is triggered during the test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` in the `pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py` file.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance is handled correctly and that the `_engine` function returns a valid engine instance.

### Corrected Version of the `_engine` function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance is now handled properly, ensuring that the `_engine` function receives a valid instance and the AttributeError is resolved.

Make sure to replace the existing `_engine` function in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file with the corrected version provided above to fix the bug.
