## Explain the bug

The bug lies in the `_engine` function within the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file. The function is supposed to avoid a reference cycle by passing a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`. However, the issue arises when the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` object instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

At runtime, the error message is triggered in the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods`, specifically at the line `assert all(x.is_monotonic for x in idx2.levels)`. This error occurs due to a weak reference issue resulting in an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.

To resolve this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is maintained until all necessary operations using it are completed. 

## Updated `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` with the bug fix

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# Fixed version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_obj = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    # Ensure the weak reference is retained until the return step
    if engine_obj is not None:
        return engine_obj
    else:
        raise RuntimeError("Engine object is None.")
```

By modifying the `_engine` function to retain the weak reference until the return step, the bug related to weak references and None object errors should be resolved. This updated function should provide consistent behavior and avoid the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
