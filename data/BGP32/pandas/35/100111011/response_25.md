### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_engine` is using a weak reference of `self` to prevent a reference cycle.
- The error message indicates that an AttributeError occurs due to a 'NoneType' object having no attribute 'view'.
- The failing test accesses `is_monotonic` for each element in `idx2.levels`.
- The GitHub issue highlights that weak referencing is not functioning as intended, leading to the AttributeError.

### Bug Description:
The bug in the `_engine` function causes the PeriodEngine to receive a NoneType object instead of the intended PeriodIndex, resulting in an AttributeError when trying to access the 'view' attribute.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, ensure that the weak reference of `self` is correctly maintained and utilized in the `_engine` function to avoid passing a NoneType object to the PeriodEngine.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By invoking `period()` when retrieving the object from the weak reference, it should return the actual object referenced by `self` instead of a NoneType. This change should address the issue and the failing test, allowing the correct usage of weak referencing.
