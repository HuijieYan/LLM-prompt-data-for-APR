### Analysis:
- The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref()` to create a weak reference of `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`.
- The error message indicates that an `AttributeError` is raised due to a `NoneType` object not having the attribute `view`.
- The failing test is related to `is_monotonic`, which ultimately leads to the `_engine` function's bug causing the issue.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The weak reference created by `weakref.ref(self)` might not be correctly passed or stored inside `_engine_type`.
- This results in the `self._engine` attribute ending up as `None`, leading to an attribute error when accessing `view("i8")`.

### Fix Strategy:
- Ensure that the weak reference of `self` is correctly propagated and stored within `_engine_type`.
- Address the weak reference handling to prevent it from getting lost or turned into `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("Engine creation failed, check weak reference handling")
    return engine
``` 

By ensuring that the `engine` returned is not `None`, we can avoid the `AttributeError` and correctly utilize the weak reference of `self` within the corrected `_engine` function.
