### Analysis
The bug is occurring in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The `_engine` function is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, where `period` is supposed to be a weak reference to `self`. However, the weak reference is not being correctly created due to the line `period = weakref.ref(self)`.

### Bug Explanation
The bug arises from the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref(self)`. This line attempts to create a weak reference to `self`, but `weakref.ref` doesn't create a weak reference directly; it returns a callable that can be used to create weak references. Thus, the `period` variable is not actually a weak reference.

The error message `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` suggests that the `_engine` method is trying to access an attribute on a `NoneType` object, which is likely occurring because `period` is not a valid weak reference.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to correctly create a weak reference to `self`. We can achieve this by modifying the `period` assignment line to actually create a weak reference:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Correctly creating a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` with parentheses, we retrieve the weakly referenced object, which should resolve the issue.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Creating a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
