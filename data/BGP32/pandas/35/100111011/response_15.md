### Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. Passing `self` as a weak reference to `_engine_type` might not be preserving the reference properly.
2. The weak reference `period` might not be correctly utilized to prevent a reference cycle.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug arises from the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `NoneType` object instead of the `PeriodIndex` due to improper handling of weak references. This results in an `AttributeError` when attempting to access the `view` attribute.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the weak reference passed to `_engine_type` retains the reference.
2. Adjust the usage of weak references to avoid the issue of dropping the reference prematurely.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type properly.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By modifying the use of `period()` instead of `period`, we ensure that the weak reference is properly dereferenced before being passed to `_engine_type`, resolving the issue of receiving a `NoneType` object.
