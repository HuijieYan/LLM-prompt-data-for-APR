## Potential Error Locations within the Buggy Function
1. The use of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` might lead to the weak reference being lost prematurely.
2. The return statement `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))` may not correctly handle the weak reference `period`.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug arises from the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object being lost prematurely, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `NoneType` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`. This leads to an `AttributeError` when trying to access an attribute on `None`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until the engine instance is fully created and correctly handled within the function.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

In the corrected version:
- We use `weakref.proxy(self)` to create a proxy reference to `self`, maintaining the weak reference throughout the function's execution.

This modification should resolve the premature loss of the weak reference and prevent the `NoneType` error during attribute access.

By making this change, the corrected function should now correctly handle weak references to `PeriodIndex` objects within `MultiIndex`.
