### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is encountering an issue due to the weak reference `period` not being properly utilized. This leads to a `NoneType` object error when trying to access the view attribute. The error message during test execution is related to losing weakrefs when copying `PeriodIndex` levels within a `MultiIndex`.

### Potential Error Location
- Improper handling of the weak reference `period` within the `_engine` function.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug arises because the weak reference `period` is being assigned but not utilized correctly, leading to a `NoneType` object error at runtime due to losing the weak reference.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is properly utilized to avoid losing the reference during the function execution. By properly handling weak references, we can prevent the `NoneType` object error from occurring.

### Corrected Version

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    period_ref = period()
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we store the weak reference `period` in `period_ref` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This ensures that the weak reference is maintained and not lost during the function execution. This correction should address the issue and prevent the `NoneType` object error.
