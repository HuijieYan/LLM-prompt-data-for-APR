### Analysis:
1. The `_engine` function is using a weak reference to avoid a reference cycle but is not being used correctly.
2. The error message indicates an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, which suggests that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is becoming `None`.
3. The issue on GitHub explains that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped prematurely, leading to the incorrect behavior.
4. To fix the bug, the weak reference creation and usage need to be adjusted to ensure that the `PeriodIndex` instance is properly retained during the function execution.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the weak reference creation to ensure it remains valid during function execution.
2. Ensure that the weak reference is properly used to access the `PeriodIndex` instance.

### Corrected Version:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Retrieve the strong reference to PeriodIndex
    period = period()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By maintaining a strong reference to the `PeriodIndex`, the corrected version ensures that the weak reference does not become `None`, addressing the bug and allowing the function to work correctly.
