The bug in the `_engine` function is that the `weakref.ref(self)` call is not being used correctly. When `self` is being passed to `_engine_type`, it is expecting a weak reference object but instead receiving a regular reference due to the misuse of `weakref.ref(self)`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference object is dereferenced correctly before passing it to `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By using `period()` instead of just `period`, we are dereferencing the weak reference to obtain the original object before passing it to `_engine_type`.

This fix should address the issue reported in the failing test and the corresponding GitHub issue. The corrected version ensures that weak references are handled properly, avoiding the AttributeError encountered during execution.
