### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `_engine` function is returning a weak reference `period` instead of the actual reference to `self`. This leads to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`, resulting in an `AttributeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine` function returns the actual reference to `self` instead of a weak reference. This will provide the correct reference to the `PeriodIndex` to the `PeriodEngine`.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The relative path of the correct file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

### Changes Made
- Updated the `_engine` function to directly return `self` instead of a weak reference to `self`, ensuring that the `PeriodIndex` reference is passed correctly.

By implementing this correction, the issue reported in GitHub should be resolved, and the failing test should pass successfully.
