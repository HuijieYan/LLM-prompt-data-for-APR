### Analysis:
1. The function `_engine` is meant to return an instance of `PeriodEngine` using a weak reference to the `self` object.
2. The error points to an issue with `view("i8")` on `NoneType`, indicating that the weak reference has failed.
3. The failing test involves creating a `MultiIndex` with `PeriodIndex` values and checking if the levels are monotonic.
4. The cause of the bug is likely the weak reference not being properly maintained.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` not properly keeping a reference to the `self` object, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` instance being created with `None` instead of the actual `PeriodIndex`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is correctly maintained and used to create the `PeriodEngine` instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `period()` is invoked to generate the actual object, ensuring that the weak reference is dereferenced properly. This change should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
