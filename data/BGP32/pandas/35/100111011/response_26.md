### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object, which is a `PeriodIndex` instance. This weak reference is then passed to `self._engine_type`, but it seems that the weak reference is not being used correctly, leading to an attribute error.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is trying to check if all levels of the `MultiIndex` constructed from a `PeriodIndex` are monotonic. This test is failing due to the bug in the `_engine` function.
3. The error message indicates an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`. This suggests that the weak reference created in `_engine` is becoming `None`, resulting in the error while accessing the weak reference attributes.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained correctly until it is used by `self._engine_type`. Additionally, we need to handle the case when the weak reference is no longer valid.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Instead of creating a weak reference to `self` inside `_engine`, store it outside the function.
2. Check if the weak reference is still valid before using it inside `_engine` to avoid the `NoneType` error.
3. Handle the weak reference appropriately to ensure it remains valid until needed.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, preserve a weak reference of self
    self._period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference to `self` outside the function `_engine`, we ensure that the reference remains valid until it is used by `self._engine_type`. This approach addresses the bug where the weak reference was becoming `None`, causing the attribute error.
