### Analysis
The error occurs due to the fact that the `_engine` function is returning `None` instead of the expected `PeriodEngine` object, resulting in an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute. This leads to a failure in the test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods` as it expects the engines to be correctly constructed.

### Bug Cause
The bug is happening because the `weakref.ref` function is not properly handling the weak reference to the `self` object. This results in the `PeriodEngine` initialization receiving a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`. As a consequence, the `view` attribute can't be accessed, causing the `NoneType` object error.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, a proper weak reference implementation for the `self` object should be used to ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives the correct object for construction, avoiding the `NoneType` issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Proper weak reference for self
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By making this change, the bug causing the test to fail should be resolved, and the desired behavior from the `test_get_level_values_when_periods` function should be achieved.
