To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `self` object is correctly maintained and used within the `_engine_type` constructor. The error message suggests that a `NoneType` object is being accessed, indicating that the weak reference creation might be incorrect.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Correct weak reference creation and usage
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `weakref.ref(self)` is changed to `weakref.ref(self)()` to retrieve the original object from the weak reference before passing it to the `_engine_type` constructor. This change ensures that the weak reference is correctly resolved to the object it references.

This modification should fix the issue reported in the failing test related to weak references and allow the test to pass successfully.
