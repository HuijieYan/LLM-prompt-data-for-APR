### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is returning an incorrect value causing an AttributeError in the failing test. The issue originates from the weak reference creation and usage within the function.

### Identified Bug
The bug appears to stem from the weak reference created with `weakref.ref(self)` not being properly utilized. It seems that the weak reference `period` is not being properly passed to `_engine_type`, leading to the `'.view("i8")'` operation on a `NoneType` object.

### Bug Cause
1. The weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` is not used correctly when passed to `_engine_type`.
2. This leads to the `_engine_type` function receiving a `None` object where it expects a reference to `self` as a PeriodIndex object.
3. Consequently, the `'.view("i8")'` operation is attempted on a `None` object, resulting in an AttributeError.

### Fix Strategy
To resolve the bug:
1. Ensure that the weak reference created is properly utilized within `_engine` and correctly passed to `_engine_type`.
2. Address the weak reference handling to maintain a proper reference to `self` in the function return.

### Corrected Function
```python
# The corrected _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

In this corrected version, the weak reference usage has been adjusted to utilize `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, ensuring that a proper reference is maintained to `self` when passed to `_engine_type`. This adjustment should resolve the weak reference handling issue and prevent the AttributeError encountered in the failing test.
