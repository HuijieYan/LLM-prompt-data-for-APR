### Analysis:
1. The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is a `PeriodIndex` instance.
2. The error occurs when the function tries to access a property of the weak reference where `self` becomes None unexpectedly.
3. The failing test is related to checking if all levels within `idx2` are monotonic.
4. The GitHub issue suggests that weak references are getting dropped prematurely leading to a `NoneType` error.
5. The bug seems to be in how weak references are handled within the `_engine` function for `PeriodIndex`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the premature dropping of the weak reference, leading to `self` being None when trying to access properties of `PeriodEngine`.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the weak reference to `self` remains valid while being used in the `_engine` function.
2. Improve the weak reference handling to prevent it from becoming None before it should.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Keep a reference to self while using PeriodEngine
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    engine._weakref = period  # Save the weak reference for continued use
    return engine
```

In this corrected version, we save the weak reference to `PeriodIndex` within the `PeriodEngine` instance to ensure it remains valid. This modification should address the premature dropping of the weak reference causing the `NoneType` error.
