### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is decorating using `@cache_readonly`, indicating that the result should be cached after the first call.
2. The function is creating a weak reference to `self` and passing it to `_engine_type`.
3. The error occurs in the `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))` line due to a `NoneType` object trying to access the `view` attribute.

### Error Cause
The bug arises because the weak reference to `self` is not properly handled, leading to the weak reference being dropped prematurely, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `NoneType` object instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`. This causes attribute access errors.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that the weak reference to `self` remains valid throughout the `_engine` function execution.
2. Address the premature dropping of the weak reference to prevent the `NoneType` object access.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Keep a strong reference to self to prevent weakref from being dropped
    period_obj = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_obj, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `weakref.proxy` is used to create a weak reference ProxyType object that keeps the weak reference alive until it's explicitly destroyed. By using `period_obj` as a strong reference proxy, the weak reference to `self` remains valid during the `_engine` function execution, preventing premature dropping and resolving the bug.
