### Analysis
1. The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref` to avoid reference cycle issues but is returning an uninitialized object leading to the `NoneType` error.
2. The error occurs when trying to access `self._engine.is_monotonic_increasing` which results in `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.
3. The failing test is trying to check if all levels of the `MultiIndex` are monotonic.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly handled in the `_engine` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the `_engine` function to handle the weak reference properly and return the actual object instead of an uninitialized one.
2. Ensure that the engine type returned by `_engine` has the necessary attributes to avoid `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error.
3. Update the implementation so that the weak reference to `self` is maintained correctly.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
