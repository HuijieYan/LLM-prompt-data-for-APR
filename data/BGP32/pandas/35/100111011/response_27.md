### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self` before passing it to `self._engine_type`. The issue seems to originate from the weak reference handling.
2. From the failing test, it is clear that the `is_monotonic` property is being accessed on `idx2.levels`, which eventually calls the `_engine` method of the index object. This exposes the bug in the `_engine` method.
3. The error message indicates that an 'AttributeError' occurs in the `pandas/_libs/index.pyx` file, specifically in the method `pandas._libs.index.IndexEngine.is_monotonic_increasing.__get__`, where a 'NoneType' object does not have the attribute 'view'. This error suggests that the weak reference handling inside `_engine` is leading to a `NoneType` object where it should not be.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference handling in `_engine` does not lead to a `NoneType` object, thereby avoiding the 'AttributeError' during property access when checking monotonicity.

### Bug Fix:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:  # Check if engine is None after creation
        return self._engine_type(self, len(self))  # Create a new engine without weakref
    return engine
```

By explicitly checking if the engine is `None` after creation, the fixed function ensures that if the weak reference handling leads to a `NoneType` object, a new engine is created without the weak reference. This fix prevents the 'AttributeError' when accessing properties like `view` on the engine object.

With this fix, the test case `test_get_level_values_when_periods` should pass without raising the 'AttributeError' mentioned in the error message.
