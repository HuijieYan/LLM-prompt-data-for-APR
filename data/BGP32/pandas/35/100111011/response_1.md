Analyzing the buggy function `_engine`, the issue is related to weak reference handling causing an attribute error in the `pandas/_libs/index.pyx` file. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` tries to assert the monotonically increasing nature of the levels in the `idx2` MultiIndex, which triggers the problematic `_engine` function.

The probable cause of the bug is the weak referencing of `self` in the `_engine` function, which might lead to dropping the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` before it's needed, resulting in the `NoneType` error. This situation is due to the weak reference mechanism not being correctly set up in the `_engine` function.

To address the bug and resolve the issue, a fix is needed in the weak reference handling in the `_engine` function. By ensuring that the weak reference to `self` is maintained and accessed correctly within the `_engine` function, the issue should get resolved.

Below is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By invoking the weak reference with `period()`, we dereference the weak reference to obtain the original `self` object, allowing it to be passed to `_engine_type` correctly, fixing the bug related to weak references and resolving the attributed error identified in the failing test.

This corrected version should address the bug, allowing the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` to pass correctly and resolve the GitHub issue titled "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs".
