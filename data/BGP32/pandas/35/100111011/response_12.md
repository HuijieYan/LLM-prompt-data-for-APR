### Bug Analysis:
The `_engine` function in the `period.py` file is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`, but it seems that the reference is not being successfully passed to `_engine_type`. This results in the `PeriodEngine` object being initialized with `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`. This leads to the `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weakly referenced `self` is correctly passed to `_engine_type`. We can modify the `_engine` function to handle the weak reference object properly and ensure that the `PeriodIndex` is passed to the `PeriodEngine`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Updated fixed function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

With this correction, the `self` object will be obtained from the weak reference before passing it to the `PeriodEngine`. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives the correct `PeriodIndex` object.

This fix should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
