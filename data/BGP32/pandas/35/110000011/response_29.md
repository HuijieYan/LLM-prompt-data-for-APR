### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`, but the issue reported on GitHub indicates that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped prematurely, leading to a `None` being passed to `self._engine_type`.

### Potential Error Locations:
The issue seems to be related to how the weak reference is handled or accessed within the `_engine` function.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to premature dropping of the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex`, resulting in `None` being passed to `self._engine_type`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, it's essential to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance is maintained until it's no longer needed, preventing it from being dropped prematurely.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Use a local reference `self_ref` to prevent weak reference from being dropped prematurely.
        self_ref = weakref.ref(self)
        
        return self._engine_type(self_ref, len(self))
```

In this corrected version, we create a local reference `self_ref` to hold the weak reference to `self` within the `_engine` function, preventing it from being dropped prematurely. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
