### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_engine` is part of the `PeriodIndex` class, which inherits from `DatetimeIndexOpsMixin` and `Int64Index`.
- The issue on GitHub highlights a problem where weakrefs are lost when copying `PeriodIndex` levels in a `MultiIndex`.
- The `_engine` function uses a weak reference to store a reference to `self` and pass it to `_engine_type`, but the weak reference handling seems problematic.

### Error Location:
- The issue seems to stem from the way the weak reference is handled in the `_engine` function.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug arises because the weak reference to `self` is not being used correctly in the `_engine` function. When the `PeriodIndex` object is copied in the `MultiIndex` scenario, the weak reference gets lost, leading to `None` being passed to `_engine_type`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- One potential approach to fix the bug is to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly maintained and handled throughout the copying process of `PeriodIndex` levels in the `MultiIndex`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    # Corrected version of the _engine function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Use bound method to maintain weak reference to self
        period = weakref.proxy(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `weakref.ref(self)` is changed to `weakref.proxy(self)` to correctly maintain the weak reference to `self` during the execution of `_engine` function. This fix should address the issue related to losing weakrefs during the copying of `PeriodIndex` levels in a `MultiIndex`.
