### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance. However, the issue reported on GitHub indicates that in some cases, the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

### Error Location:
The potential error lies in the creation and handling of the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance in the `_engine` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is prematurely dropped due to reference cycles, which results in the `_engine_type` function receiving `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance is not prematurely dropped. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference in a class attribute or another suitable container to maintain the reference until it is no longer needed.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference to self in a class attribute
    self._weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._weakref, len(self))
```

This corrected version ensures that the weak reference to `self` is stored in the `_weakref` attribute of the `PeriodIndex` instance, preventing premature dropping of the reference. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to losing weakrefs when copying `PeriodIndex` levels in a `MultiIndex`.
