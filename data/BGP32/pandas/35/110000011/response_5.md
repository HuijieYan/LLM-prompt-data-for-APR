### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object (which is an instance of `PeriodIndex`). The weak reference is then passed to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`. However, the bug mentioned in the GitHub issue "Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs" indicates that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object is dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

### Issue Location:
The potential error location in the buggy function is the `weakref.ref(self)` call. This may lead to premature removal of the weakly referenced object before it is actually used by `_engine_type`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the premature removal of the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`. This behavior results in errors when trying to access attributes or methods of the `PeriodIndex`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained until it is actually used by `_engine_type`. One way to achieve this is by storing the weak reference externally in the `PeriodIndex` instance to prevent it from being garbage collected prematurely.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference externally in the PeriodIndex instance
    self._weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._weak_period, len(self))
```

In this corrected version, we store the weak reference `self._weak_period` in the `PeriodIndex` instance, ensuring that it remains valid until `_engine_type` is called. This should address the issue of losing weakrefs when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`.
