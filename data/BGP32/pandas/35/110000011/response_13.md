### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using a weak reference to the `self`, which is an instance of `PeriodIndex`. However, due to the bug described in the GitHub issue, the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The `period = weakref.ref(self)` line may not be correctly maintaining the weak reference.
2. The weak reference may be getting lost or not properly utilized, leading to the `None` being returned.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance being lost or not behaving as expected. This results in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`. This behavior leads to errors when accessing attributes or methods of the `PeriodIndex` instance.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance needs to be properly maintained throughout the lifetime of the `_engine` function. This will ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance and can operate correctly.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Maintain a weak reference to self throughout the function
        period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
        
        def engine_type_wrapper(period_ref, length):
            if period_ref is None:
                return None
            
            return self._engine_type(period_ref(), length)
        
        # Pass the weak reference to the engine type wrapper
        return engine_type_wrapper(period_weakref, len(self))
``` 

This corrected version ensures that a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance is maintained throughout the `_engine` function. Additionally, it includes a wrapper function to handle the weak reference properly and prevent `None` from being passed to the `PeriodEngine`.
