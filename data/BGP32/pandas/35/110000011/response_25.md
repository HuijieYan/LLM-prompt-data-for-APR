### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class is using a weak reference `weakref.ref(self)` to avoid a reference cycle. However, the issue reported on GitHub suggests that copying `PeriodIndex` levels within a `MultiIndex` leads to losing weak references, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. `weakref.ref(self)` usage within the `_engine` function. 
2. Passing the weak reference to `_engine_type` method.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the weak reference not being maintained properly when copying levels within a `MultiIndex`. This leads to the weak reference being lost and the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None`, eventually resulting in the error reported on GitHub.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained properly when copying levels within a `MultiIndex`. This can be achieved by handling the weak reference carefully within the `_engine` function.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self)).deref()
```

By adding the `.deref()` method at the end of returning the `PeriodEngine`, we ensure that the weak reference is properly handled and the `PeriodIndex` object is not lost in the weak referencing process. This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub.
