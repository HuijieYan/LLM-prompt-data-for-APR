## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a cached read-only property of the `PeriodIndex` class.
2. The issue on GitHub indicates that copying `PeriodIndex` levels on a `MultiIndex` results in losing weakrefs, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of a `PeriodIndex`.
3. The bug occurs because the weak reference `period` is being assigned to the `PeriodIndex` instance `self`, but it is not being used properly in the `_engine_type` initialization, leading to the weak reference being lost.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly passed to `_engine_type` so that the `PeriodEngine` receives a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex`.

## Bug Fix:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))  # Pass the weak reference as a callable function
``` 

In the corrected version, the weak reference `period` is now being called as a function `period()` when passed to `_engine_type`, ensuring that it returns a valid reference to `self` within the `PeriodEngine`.
