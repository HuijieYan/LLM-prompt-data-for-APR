### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is supposed to return an instance of `self._engine_type` by passing a weak reference of `self` to it. This is done to avoid a reference cycle. However, in the buggy code, the weak reference is not being correctly utilized, leading to potential issues with weakrefs being lost.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect usage of `weakref.ref(self)` which may not properly maintain a weak reference to `self`.
2. Possible loss of weakrefs leading to unexpected behavior.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises due to the weak reference `period` not being used effectively in creating the `_engine` instance, causing the weak reference to be lost prematurely. This leads to unexpected behavior when working with MultiIndex levels.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is properly maintained throughout the `_engine` function so that it remains valid when passed to `self._engine_type`. This will prevent the weakref from being lost prematurely.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class:

```python
# Corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self
    ref_self = weakref.ref(self)
    
    # Define a lambda function to encapsulate instance creation
    create_engine = lambda: self._engine_type(ref_self(), len(self))
    
    return create_engine()
```

This corrected version explicitly creates a lambda function `create_engine` which encapsulates the instance creation while ensuring that the weak reference `ref_self` remains valid. By using this approach, we can prevent the premature loss of weakrefs in the `PeriodIndex` class.
