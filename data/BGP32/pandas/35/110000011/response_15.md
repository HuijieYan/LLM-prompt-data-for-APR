### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is trying to create a weak reference to the object `self` and pass it to the `_engine_type` method. This is done to avoid a reference cycle, which can lead to memory leaks in Python. However, the weak reference implementation seems to be incorrect, which is causing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.

### Identified Error:
The error seems to be in the way the weak reference is being created. The line `period = weakref.ref(self)` is expected to create a weak reference to the `self` object, but it should actually be assigning the reference returned by `weakref.ref(self)` to `self._period_ref` for later use in the `_engine` method.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the weak reference `period` not being stored in an instance variable of the class. This results in the weak reference being lost immediately after it is created, leading to `None` being passed to `_engine_type` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex` object.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to store the weak reference in an instance variable of the class. By doing this, the weak reference will be maintained as long as the object exists, preventing premature garbage collection.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Store the weak reference in an instance variable to prevent premature garbage collection
        self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

In this corrected version, we store the weak reference `self._period_ref` and pass it to `_engine_type` as intended. This change should fix the issue reported on GitHub related to losing weakrefs in MultiIndex operations on `PeriodIndex` levels.
