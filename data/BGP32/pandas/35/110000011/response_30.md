The cause of the bug is that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped before intended, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving a `None` instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix this bug, we should make sure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained throughout the usage of the `_engine` function. We can achieve this by storing the weak reference outside of the function scope to prevent it from being garbage collected prematurely.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

By storing `self._period_ref` as an attribute of the class instance, we ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex persists as long as the instance of the class exists. This will prevent the issue of the PeriodEngine receiving `None` instead of the PeriodIndex.
