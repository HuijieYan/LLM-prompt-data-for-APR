### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref` to create a weak reference to `self` (an instance of `PeriodIndex`).
2. The issue described on GitHub points out that when `PeriodIndex` levels are copied on `MultiIndex`, weak references are lost, leading to unexpected behavior.
3. The bug occurs because the weak reference to `self` (`PeriodIndex`) is being lost or dropped before the intended usage.
4. A strategy to fix the bug would be to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly maintained throughout the operation where the weak reference is needed.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```

### Explanation:
The bug in the original `_engine` function is fixed by directly passing the weak reference of `self` to the `_engine_type` constructor instead of storing it in a variable `period` which might cause the weak reference to be lost prematurely. By passing `weakref.ref(self)` directly, we ensure that the weak reference of `self` is correctly maintained during the operation of creating `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`. This fix should prevent the issue described on GitHub.
