**Analysis:**
- The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is intended to return an instance of the `self._engine_type`.
- The issue on GitHub highlights a scenario where copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` results in losing weakrefs, leading to unexpected behavior.
- The problem occurs because the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped earlier than expected, causing `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

**Error Location:**
- The potential error lies in the weak reference creation and handling within the `_engine` function.

**Bug Cause:**
- The bug occurs because the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance is not maintained properly, leading to early deletion of the reference and passing `None` to `_engine_type`.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**
- To fix the bug, ensure that the weak reference to `self` is stored in a class attribute to prevent early deletion. 
- This can be achieved by saving the weak reference as `self._period_weakref` for later use in the `PeriodEngine` instantiation.

**Corrected Version:**
```python
    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Store a weak reference to self in a class attribute
        if not hasattr(self, '_period_weakref'):
            self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that the weak reference is stored in the `self._period_weakref` attribute to avoid premature deletion. This change should address the issue raised on GitHub and prevent the loss of weakrefs when copying `PeriodIndex` levels within a `MultiIndex`.
