### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance, but it's not being used correctly. This function is supposed to return an instance of `PeriodArray`, but due to mishandling the weak reference, it results in `None` being passed to `_engine_type`. This issue causes errors when copying `PeriodIndex` levels in a `MultiIndex`.

### Potential error locations:
The issue lies in how the weak reference is being stored and used in the `_engine` function.

### Cause of the bug:
When the `_engine` method returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, the `period` variable should hold a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object. However, due to the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref(self)`, `period` ends up holding a reference to the weak reference object itself, resulting in passing `None` as the `PeriodIndex` instance.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To resolve the bug, we need to properly create the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance and ensure that it is correctly passed to the `_engine_type` method.

### Corrected version of the `_engine` function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
from pandas.core.indexes.accessors import PeriodEngine

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to the PeriodIndex instance
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.ref(self)` correctly and passing `period_ref` to `_engine_type`, we can ensure that the `PeriodIndex` instance is weakly referenced, fixing the bug described in the GitHub issue.
