### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object. This weak reference is then passed to `_engine_type` along with the length of the `PeriodIndex`. The intention is to avoid a reference cycle.

The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on a `MultiIndex`, weakrefs are lost, leading to an error when checking if the levels are monotonic. This suggests that the weak reference mechanism in the `_engine` function is not working as expected.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug may stem from the fact that when the `PeriodIndex` is copied as a level in a `MultiIndex`, the weak reference to the original `PeriodIndex` is being lost. This can lead to the `_engine` function receiving a None instead of a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex`, causing unexpected behavior.

### Suggested Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained even when the `PeriodIndex` is copied as a level in a `MultiIndex`. This can be achieved by modifying the `_engine` function to store the weak reference in a class attribute that persists through the copying process.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        if not hasattr(self, '_period_weakref'):
            # Store the weak reference in a class attribute
            self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` in a class attribute `_period_weakref`, we ensure that the reference is maintained even when the `PeriodIndex` is copied. This corrected version should address the reported issue on GitHub by preserving the weak reference across operations on the `PeriodIndex`.
