## Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to the `self` object. The intention of using `weakref.ref` is to avoid creating a strong reference cycle which could result in memory leaks.

The issue on GitHub indicates that when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on a `MultiIndex`, the weakrefs are lost, leading to an error where the `PeriodEngine` receives a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

## Potential Error Locations:
The issue seems to arise in the `_engine` function where the weakref is being applied to the `self` object.

## Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug can be attributed to the way weakrefs are being handled in the `_engine` function. When the `PeriodIndex` is being copied on a `MultiIndex`, the weakrefs are lost due to the implementation in the current `_engine` function.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that weakrefs are correctly maintained when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on a `MultiIndex`. This can be achieved by modifying the `_engine` function to correctly maintain the weak reference.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# Modify the buggy function in the correct class

    # Updated and corrected version of the function to fix the issue
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period_weakref, len(self))
```

By fixing the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class as shown above, the weakrefs should now be maintained when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on a `MultiIndex`, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
