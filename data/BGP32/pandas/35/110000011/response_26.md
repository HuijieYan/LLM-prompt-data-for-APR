## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using a `weakref` to create a weak reference to `self` and passing it to the `_engine_type` method. This is to avoid reference cycles.
2. However, there seems to be an issue with the weak reference handling which is causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.
3. The GitHub issue indicates that copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` leads to the loss of weak references which results in errors.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` (`PeriodIndex`) remains valid when passed to `_engine_type`.

## Proposed Fix:
We can modify the `_engine` function to store the weak reference as an instance variable to ensure that the weak reference remains alive as long as the `PeriodIndex` instance exists.

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference to self as an instance variable
    self._weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._weakref, len(self))
```

This modification should prevent the weak reference from being dropped prematurely, ensuring that the `PeriodEngine` receives a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance.
