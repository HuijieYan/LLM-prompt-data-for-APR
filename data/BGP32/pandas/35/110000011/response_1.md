### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object, but it is not being used correctly.
- The issue is related to copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` losing weakrefs, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

### Error Locations:
1. The weak reference creation `period = weakref.ref(self)` should retain a strong reference to the `PeriodIndex` object.
2. The usage of `weakref.ref` might not behave as expected for the intended purpose within `_engine`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the weak reference setup in the `_engine` function. When copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`, the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped prematurely, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the actual `PeriodIndex`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that a strong reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained throughout the lifecycle of the `_engine` function. This can be achieved by using a different approach to handle weak references or by ensuring a strong reference is kept when needed.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def _engine(self):
        return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
``` 

By directly passing the `self` reference to `_engine_type`, we avoid the weak reference issue and maintain a strong reference to the `PeriodIndex` object throughout the function. This should resolve the bug related to losing weakrefs when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`.
