### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` and then passing it to `_engine_type` to avoid a reference cycle. However, the bug is causing the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to be dropped prematurely, resulting in `None` being passed to `_engine_type` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`. This issue is causing unexpected behavior and errors in cases like copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is related to how the weak reference to `self` is handled in the `_engine` function. The premature dropping of the weakly referenced object is causing the issue described in the GitHub bug report.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until it is no longer needed. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference outside of the `_engine` function scope so that it persists for the lifetime of the `PeriodIndex` object.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store weak reference outside of the function scope
    self._weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    # Pass the stored weak reference to _engine_type
    return self._engine_type(self._weakref, len(self))
```

By modifying the `_engine` function to store the weak reference `self._weakref` outside of the function scope, we ensure that the reference is maintained as long as the `PeriodIndex` object exists. This corrected version should resolve the premature dropping issue and fix the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
