### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` method within the `PeriodIndex` class.
2. The function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance, but it is not being used correctly.
3. The GitHub issue points out that copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` loses weak references, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.
4. The bug occurs due to the weak reference being assigned to a local variable `period`, which gets garbage collected immediately, resulting in `None` being passed to `_engine_type`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance and ensure that it remains active throughout the function's execution. One approach is to store the weak reference as an attribute of the `PeriodIndex` instance itself, preventing it from being garbage collected prematurely.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)  # Storing weak reference as an attribute
    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly store the weak reference as `self._period_weakref`, ensuring that it remains alive until the `_engine` function completes execution. This change addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue by maintaining the weak reference's availability for the `PeriodEngine` to utilize correctly.
