### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` decorator function within the `PeriodIndex` class.
- This function is responsible for creating an instance of `_engine_type` with weak referencing to `self`.
- The issue described on GitHub is related to losing weakrefs when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`.

### Potential Error Locations:
- The weak referencing to `self` might not be correctly implemented, leading to weakrefs being dropped prematurely.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs because weak referencing of `self` is not properly handled within the `_engine` function.
- The premature dropping of weakrefs causes the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Ensure that weak referencing to `self` is correctly established and maintained within the `_engine` function.
- Make sure that the weakrefs are not dropped prematurely, allowing the `PeriodEngine` to receive the `PeriodIndex` as intended.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Properly weak reference 'self' to avoid premature dropping of weakrefs
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By implementing the corrected version, weak referencing to `self` is done correctly, ensuring that the weakrefs are maintained until they are no longer needed. This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to losing weakrefs when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`.
