### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_engine` is meant to create an engine instance based on the given `PeriodIndex` but is causing issues related to weak references.
- The problem is described in the GitHub issue as the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped prematurely.
- The cause of the bug is related to the usage of weak references in the `_engine` function.
- The purpose of using a weak reference in this context is to avoid creating a reference cycle (potential memory leak).
- The bug is preventing the `PeriodEngine` from receiving the intended `PeriodIndex`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained correctly until the `PeriodEngine` is created.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def _engine(self):
        # Weakly reference self to avoid reference cycle
        weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
        engine = self._engine_type(weak_period, len(self))
        return engine
```

### Changes Made:
1. Removed the `@cache_readonly` decorator as it might interfere with maintaining the weak reference until needed.
2. Created a weak reference `weak_period` to the `PeriodIndex` object.
3. Passed the weak reference to the `PeriodEngine`.
4. Returned the `engine` instance created by `PeriodEngine`.

By making these changes, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` will be maintained until the `PeriodEngine` is initialized, preventing premature dropping of the weak reference.
