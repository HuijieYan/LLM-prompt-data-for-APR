### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is supposed to return an instance of `_engine_type` using a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object to avoid reference cycles.
2. The issue described in the GitHub problem is related to copying levels in a `MultiIndex` with `PeriodIndex` leading to an error due to weakrefs being dropped prematurely.
3. The bug seems to stem from the premature dropping of weak references in the `_engine` function, causing `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex` object.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained until the `_engine` function has completed its tasks.

### Proposed Fix:
To address the bug and prevent the premature dropping of weak references in the `_engine` function, we need to modify the function to use a local variable to hold the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object. This way, the reference will remain valid for the duration of the function execution.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
