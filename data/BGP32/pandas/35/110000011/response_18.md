**Analysis:**

1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is utilizing a weak reference to avoid a reference cycle.
2. The issue mentioned on GitHub highlights a problem where copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` results in losing weak references.
3. The bug occurs because the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped prematurely, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained properly without being dropped prematurely.

**Fix Strategy:**

1. Maintain a strong reference to the `PeriodIndex` object within the `_engine` function to prevent premature dropping of weak reference.
2. Ensure that the weak reference is properly utilized to avoid reference cycles.

**Corrected Code:**

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By modifying the `_engine` function to maintain a strong reference to `self`, we ensure that the `PeriodIndex` object is not prematurely dropped and can be accessed correctly by the `PeriodEngine`.
