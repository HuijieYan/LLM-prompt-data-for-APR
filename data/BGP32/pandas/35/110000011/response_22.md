### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to itself and pass it to `_engine_type`. This is done to avoid a reference cycle.
2. The issue mentioned on GitHub is related to copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`, which leads to losing weakrefs and results in an error when checking for monotonicity.
3. The cause of the bug is that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before intended, leading to `_engine` returning `None` instead of the actual `PeriodIndex`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained throughout the `_engine` function and not dropped prematurely. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference outside the function to avoid it being garbage collected.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    # Other class methods and attributes...

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def _engine(self):
        if not hasattr(self, '_period_weakref'):
            self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
        period = self._period_weakref
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By storing the weak reference in the `PeriodIndex` instance itself (`self._period_weakref`), we ensure that the reference is maintained as long as the `PeriodIndex` object exists. This will prevent the issue of losing weakrefs when copying levels on `MultiIndex`.
