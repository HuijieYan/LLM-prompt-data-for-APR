### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` incorrectly. This potentially causes a reference cycle issue, leading to unexpected behavior when accessing `PeriodEngine` with a weak reference of `self`.

### Error Location:
The error is in the line:
```python
period = weakref.ref(self)
```
where `weakref.ref(self)` is incorrectly used.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug causes a weak reference to be created with `weakref.ref(self)`, which may result in a reference cycle issue. This issue is related to the dropping of weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` before the intended time, causing `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the actual `PeriodIndex`.

### Fix Strategy:
Instead of using `weakref.ref(self)`, we should use `weakref.proxy(self)` to create a weak reference proxy to `self`. This way, we can avoid the reference cycle issue and ensure that the correct `PeriodIndex` is passed to `PeriodEngine`.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Use weakref.proxy to create a weak reference proxy
        period = weakref.proxy(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By making this change, we can resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to losing weak refs when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`.
