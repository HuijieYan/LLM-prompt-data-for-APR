### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance, but the weak reference is not being handled correctly.
- The issue mentioned on GitHub suggests that copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` is causing the weak references to be lost, leading to errors when accessing certain properties.
  
### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs due to the weak reference not being handled properly, causing it to be dropped before intended.
  
### Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance is maintained properly throughout the `PeriodIndex` class.
  
### Corrected Version:
```python
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    # Other class code remains unchanged
    
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        if not hasattr(self, "_period_weakref"):
            self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

### Explanation:
- In the corrected version, we check if the weak reference `_period_weakref` attribute is already set for the `PeriodIndex` instance.
- If the weak reference is not set, we create a weak reference to `self` and store it in the `_period_weakref` attribute.
- This approach ensures that the weak reference is maintained throughout the `PeriodIndex` class usage, preventing it from being dropped prematurely.
- This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub by properly handling weak references when accessing `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`.
