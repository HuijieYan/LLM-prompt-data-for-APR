The bug in the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class is related to the weak reference handling. The GitHub issue points out that copying `PeriodIndex` levels on a `MultiIndex` loses weak references, leading to unexpected behavior due to dropping the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` before it is intended.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference of the `PeriodIndex` instance is maintained properly throughout the `_engine` function. One way to achieve this is by modifying the `_engine` function to store the weak reference in an instance attribute.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
    weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        return self._engine_type(self.weak_period, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference in the `weak_period` instance attribute and passing it to the `_engine_type` function, we ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance is maintained properly. This should resolve the issue of losing weak references when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on a `MultiIndex`.

Please update the code in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file with the corrected `_engine` function implementation above to fix the bug.
