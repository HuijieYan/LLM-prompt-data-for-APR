### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object and then passing it to `_engine_type` constructor. However, the issue reported on GitHub suggests that copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` is losing the weakref reference. This is causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive None instead of the actual `PeriodIndex`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The creation of the weak reference using `weakref.ref(self)`.
2. Passing the weak reference to `_engine_type` constructor.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to the way weak referencing is implemented in the `_engine` function. When the `PeriodIndex` object is copied on `MultiIndex`, the weak reference is lost, leading to `PeriodEngine` receiving None instead of the correct `PeriodIndex`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to find a more robust way to maintain the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object, even when it is copied on `MultiIndex`. One possible approach could be to store the weak reference outside of the `_engine` function, ensuring it remains valid even after the object is copied.

### Corrected Version of the `_engine` Function:
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        if not hasattr(self, '_period_weakref'):
            self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
        
        return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we store the weak reference in a separate attribute `_period_weakref` of the `PeriodIndex` object. This ensures that the weak reference remains valid even after copying the `PeriodIndex`. Then, we pass this stored weak reference to the `_engine_type` constructor, preventing the issue of losing the weakref when the object is copied on `MultiIndex`.
