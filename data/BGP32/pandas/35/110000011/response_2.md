**Analysis:**
- The buggy function `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class is attempting to create an instance of `_engine_type` using a weak reference to the `self` object.
- The bug is related to weak references being lost during the creation of `PeriodIndex` objects for levels in a `MultiIndex`, as described in the GitHub issue.
- The weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped prematurely, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

**Bug Cause:**
- The bug occurs because the weak reference to `self` is not being maintained throughout the usage of the `_engine` function, leading to the weak reference being lost before it can be utilized by the `PeriodEngine`.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**
- To resolve the issue, the weak reference to `self` needs to be maintained in a way that it persists until the `PeriodEngine` instance is fully created and utilized.
- One approach is to store the weak reference to `self` within an instance variable of the `PeriodIndex` class, ensuring its availability throughout the life cycle of the `_engine` function.

**Corrected Version:**
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# Add the following import
from pandas.core.arrays.period import PeriodEngine

class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    """
    Immutable ndarray holding ordinal values indicating regular periods in time.
    Index keys are boxed to Period objects which carries the metadata (eg, frequency information).

    (Rest of the class remains unchanged...)

    Attributes, Methods, and examples remain the same as mentioned in the original code.

    """
    
    def __init__(self, data=None, copy=False, freq=None, year=None, month=None, quarter=None, day=None,
                 hour=None, minute=None, second=None, tz=None, dtype=None):
        super().__init__(data=data, copy=copy, freq=freq, year=year, month=month, quarter=quarter, day=day,
                         hour=hour, minute=minute, second=second, tz=tz, dtype=dtype)
        self._weak_ref = weakref.ref(self)  # Store a weak reference to self
    
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Retrieve the weak reference explicitly
        period = self._weak_ref
        return PeriodEngine(period, len(self))

```

By storing a weak reference to `self` within the `PeriodIndex` class and retrieving it in the `_engine` function, the corrected version ensures that the weak reference is available for use by the `PeriodEngine` instance, resolving the bug described in the GitHub issue.
