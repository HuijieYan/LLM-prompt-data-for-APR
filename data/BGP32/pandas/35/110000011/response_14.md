The bug in the `_engine` function is causing the weakly referenced PeriodIndex to be dropped prematurely, resulting in a None value being passed to the PeriodEngine instead of the PeriodIndex. This leads to unexpected behavior and errors when working with MultiIndex levels that contain weakrefs.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex (`self`) is properly maintained until it is no longer needed. We can achieve this by modifying the `_engine` function to store the weakref outside of the function scope to prevent it from being garbage collected prematurely.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
from pandas.core.arrays.period import PeriodEngine

# Updated _engine function to maintain the weak reference outside of the function scope
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    if not hasattr(self, '_period_weakref'):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference `self._period_weakref` as an attribute of the `PeriodIndex` instance, we ensure that it remains valid and accessible when needed by the `PeriodEngine`. This modification resolves the premature dropping of the weakly referenced PeriodIndex and allows the MultiIndex levels to function correctly.

This fix addresses the GitHub issue regarding copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex losing weakrefs, ensuring that the expected output is achieved.
