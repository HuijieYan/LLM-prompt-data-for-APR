### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is utilizing a weak reference `weakref.ref(self)` to avoid creating a reference cycle. However, the issue arises because the weak reference is not being held onto properly causing the `Period` engine to receive `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs due to the weak reference to self not being properly maintained, leading to the weak reference becoming invalid before it is used.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is being held onto correctly throughout the function execution.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Hold onto the weakref to self
    self_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self_weakref, len(self))
``` 

By properly holding onto the weak reference to `self` throughout the function, we ensure that the `PeriodIndex` is not lost before being used by the `Period` engine. This correction should resolve the issue and allow the failing test to pass.
