Based on the provided information, the bug in the function `_engine` is related to weak referencing of the self object, which is not being done correctly. This leads to a reference cycle issue and `None` being passed to `_engine_type` instead of the correct `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is correctly created for the `self` object and that it is passed to `_engine_type` appropriately.

Here is a corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In this corrected version, we create a weak reference `period` to the `self` object using `weakref.ref(self)` and then call `period()` to get a strong reference to the `PeriodIndex` object when passing it to `_engine_type`.

With this correction, the weak reference to `self` is correctly utilized to avoid the reference cycle issue, ensuring that the `PeriodIndex` object is properly passed to `_engine_type`, fixing the bug.
