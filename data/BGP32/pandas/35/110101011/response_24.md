## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is utilizing `weakref.ref(self)` to avoid a reference cycle and passing the weak reference to `_engine_type`. This function is intended to prevent memory leaks by using weak references.
2. The bug seems to stem from the way the weak reference `period` is being created and used. It appears that the reference to `self` is being lost before being passed to `_engine_type`, leading to a `None` being passed instead.
3. In the failing test, the issue arises when `idx._get_level_values(level)` is called within the `test_get_level_values_when_periods` test. This ultimately leads to an error because the weak reference to `PeriodIndex` is lost, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.
4. To fix the bug, the weak reference creation needs to be adjusted to ensure that it persists until it's actually used in `_engine_type`. Ensuring that the weak reference remains valid until the engine is created should resolve the issue.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class.

## Corrected Version
```python
    def _engine(self):
        # Create a weak reference to self that remains valid until used in _engine_type
        self_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
        
        def create_engine():
            return self._engine_type(self_weakref(), len(self))
        
        return create_engine()
```

By capturing `self` within the `create_engine` function, we can ensure that the weak reference remains valid until it's actually needed to instantiate the engine. This modification should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and allow the test to pass successfully.
