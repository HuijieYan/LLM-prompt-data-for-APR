### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class seems to be causing an issue where the weak reference `period` is not correctly set, leading to `None` being passed to `_engine_type`. This issue is causing problems with weak references being lost and resulting in errors in the failing test.

### Bug Cause
The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref` on `self`, which creates a weak reference object but doesn't correctly maintain the reference when passing it to `_engine_type`. This causes the reference to be lost, leading to `None` being passed instead.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To address the issue, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly maintained and passed to `_engine_type`. This can be achieved by modifying the way the weak reference is created and used within the `_engine` function.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference of self to maintain the reference
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, we create a proxy object that maintains the reference to `self` without breaking it. This should address the weak reference issue and resolve the problems encountered in the failing test scenario.
