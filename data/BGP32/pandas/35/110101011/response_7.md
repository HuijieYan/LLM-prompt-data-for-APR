### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self (PeriodIndex)`, but in the return statement, it is not being handled correctly leading to potential reference cycle issues.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is trying to create a MultiIndex with PeriodIndex levels and check if the levels are monotonic, which fails due to the issue with weak referencing within PeriodIndex.

### Bug Cause
The bug in the `_engine` function is due to the weak referencing not being properly handled, causing potential reference cycle problems that impact the behaviour of PeriodIndex instances.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the weak reference to `self` (PeriodIndex) needs to be properly utilized and handled in the `_engine` function to prevent any reference cycle issues.

### Corrected Version of the `_engine` Function
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    def create_engine(period_ref, length):
        return self._engine_type(period_ref, length)

    return create_engine(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, I have created a new `create_engine` inner function that takes the weak reference `period` and the length of `self` as arguments and then returns the result of `self._engine_type` using these arguments. This method ensures that the weak reference is not lost during the creation of the engine instance.
