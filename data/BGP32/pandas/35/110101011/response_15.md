### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using a `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference of `self` to avoid a reference cycle and pass it to `_engine_type`. However, the weak reference is not being handled properly, leading to potential issues.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` aims to test whether the levels of a `MultiIndex` created from a `PeriodIndex` are monotonic. The issue seems to be related to weak referencing and copying of `PeriodIndex` levels.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by not handling the weak reference correctly in the `_engine` function. The `period = weakref.ref(self)` line creates a weak reference `period` of `self`, but it is not passed to `_engine_type` correctly. This leads to the `_engine_type` function receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`, causing issues in other parts of the code and failing the test.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the weak reference within the `_engine` function and ensure it is passed to `_engine_type` properly with the necessary checks to prevent None values being passed. 

### Corrected Version
```python
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        if period() is not None:
            return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
        return None
```

Applying the corrected version with the proper handling of the weak reference should resolve the issue and pass the failing test related to `PeriodIndex` levels in `MultiIndex`.
