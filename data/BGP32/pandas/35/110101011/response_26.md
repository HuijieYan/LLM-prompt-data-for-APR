### Analysis
The `PeriodIndex` class has a `_engine` method that is used to create an engine based on the `self._engine_type`. The issue seems to be related to weak referencing in this method, causing the engine to receive `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

### Error Location
The problematic code seems to be in the `_engine` method where a weak reference to `self` is created but not maintained properly.

### Bug Cause
The bug seems to stem from the weakref not being maintained correctly, resulting in the engine receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` in the `_engine` method is properly maintained throughout the method's lifetime.

### Updated Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
``` 

By passing the weak reference as an argument directly to `_engine_type`, we can ensure that the reference is correctly maintained throughout the method's execution.

This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
