### Analysis
The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is attempting to create an instance of `self._engine_type` but is incorrectly passing a weak reference to `self` instead of the actual reference. This results in the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the actual `PeriodIndex`, causing the failing test.

### Bug Cause
The bug is due to the usage of `weakref.ref(self)` in the `_engine` function, where it should actually be dereferenced using `()` to obtain the actual reference.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to change the way the weak reference is created to not return a weak reference but the actual reference to `self`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By updating the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class as shown above, we correct the bug by passing the actual reference to `self` instead of a weak reference, ensuring that the `PeriodEngine` receives the correct reference to `PeriodIndex`. This change should resolve the failing test and the GitHub issue.
