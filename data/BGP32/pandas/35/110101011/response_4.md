The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is causing the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` due to weak reference handling. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the problem with weak references getting lost, leading to `None` being passed to the `PeriodEngine`.

### Cause of the bug:
The buggy function `_engine` attempts to create a weak reference to `self`, but the weak reference is not stored properly for later retrieval. This results in the weak reference getting lost, causing `None` to be passed to the `PeriodEngine` constructor, leading to the test failure.

### Fix strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is held properly to prevent it from being lost before being used in the `_engine_type` constructor.

### Corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
def _engine(self):
    # Hold a strong reference to self when creating the weak reference
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    self._period_weak_reference = period  # Store the weak reference in an instance variable
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference in an instance variable `_period_weak_reference`, we ensure that the weak reference is not lost prematurely. This correction should resolve the weak reference handling issue and allow the test case to pass successfully.
