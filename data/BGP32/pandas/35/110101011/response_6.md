### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a cached read-only property of the `PeriodIndex` class.
2. The function creates a weak reference to `self` (the `PeriodIndex` object) named `period`, then returns the result of instantiating the `_engine_type` class with `period` and the length of `self`.
3. The failing test involves creating a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex`, which triggers the issue related to weak references being dropped prematurely.
4. The bug causes the `PeriodIndex` object to be a None when creating the `_engine` property, leading to unexpected behavior and errors.
5. To fix the bug, consider ensuring that the weak reference to `self` remains valid throughout the function call.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the premature dropping of the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` in the `_engine` property, resulting in the `_engine` property returning None instead of the expected engine. This issue disrupts the functionality of the `PeriodIndex` class and results in errors when used in certain scenarios.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object should be maintained throughout the `_engine` function call to ensure that the engine creation receives a valid reference. This can be achieved by preserving the weak reference until needed to create the engine.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Preserving the weak reference until engine creation
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the weak reference to `self` remains valid until used to create the engine, fixing the issue related to weak references being dropped prematurely. It addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
