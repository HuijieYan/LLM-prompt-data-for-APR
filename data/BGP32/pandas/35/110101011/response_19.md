### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is returning `None` instead of the expected `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. This issue is causing the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` to fail when trying to assess the monotonicity of levels in a `MultiIndex`.

### Identified Bug Location
The bug is located in the `_engine` function where it returns `None` instead of the expected type.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect return value of the `_engine` function. The weak reference `period` is correctly defined, but it is not properly passed to `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, leading to `None` being returned.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Correctly pass the weak reference `period` to `self._engine_type` method.
2. Ensure that the return value of `_engine` is not `None`, but the result obtained by `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.

### Corrected Version

```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In this corrected version, we correctly pass the weak reference `period` to `self._engine_type` method and return the result obtained by `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
