### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` instance, but it is not being used correctly.
   
2. The issue described on GitHub points out that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_engine` function is due to incorrect handling of weak references. The use of `weakref.ref(self)` is meant to create a weak reference to `self`, but it is not being utilized properly, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, the weak reference should be stored properly and accessed when needed to ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    if not hasattr(self, '_period_weakref'):
        self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```
