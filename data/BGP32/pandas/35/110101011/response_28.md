### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` function within the `PeriodIndex` class. It uses a weak reference to the `self` object (a `PeriodIndex` instance) and then calls `_engine_type` passing this weak reference and the length of the index.
2. The issue seems to be related to weak references not being maintained properly, leading to a `None` being passed to `_engine_type`.
3. The failing test involves creating a `MultiIndex` using a `PeriodIndex` column, then trying to get level values from this `MultiIndex`. The issue arises because weak references are not properly maintained in the `_engine` method, leading to an error when checking for monotonicity.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained correctly in the `_engine` method.
5. A possible fix would be to assign the weak reference `period` to an attribute of the `PeriodIndex` instance, ensuring it persists beyond the scope of the `_engine` function.

### Bug Fix
```python
# Fixing the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    self._period = weakref.ref(self)  # Maintain a reference to the weakref
    return self._engine_type(self._period, len(self))
```
