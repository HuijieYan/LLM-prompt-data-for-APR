### Analysis:
1. The function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class seems to be trying to create an instance of `_engine_type` by passing a weak reference to `self`. This is done to avoid a reference cycle.
2. The issue mentioned on GitHub indicates that weakrefs are getting lost, leading to the `_engine` function receiving `None` instead of the actual `PeriodIndex`.
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` and then tries to get the level values, which in turn accesses the `_engine` function of `PeriodIndex`. The weak reference is not properly maintained, causing the test to fail.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained correctly so that the `_engine` function can receive the actual `PeriodIndex`.

### Bug Cause:
The weak reference to `self` in the `_engine` function is being dropped prematurely, resulting in `None` being passed to `_engine_type` instead of the actual `PeriodIndex` instance.

### Fix Strategy:
We need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is retained throughout the execution of the `_engine` function to avoid losing the reference prematurely.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Fixing the weak reference issue in the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    
    # Ensure period object is not garbage collected
    if not hasattr(self, '_period_ref'):
        self._period_ref = period_ref

    return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

By retaining the weak reference in the `self._period_ref` attribute, we ensure that it is not prematurely released. This corrected version should resolve the issue where weakrefs were being lost in the `PeriodIndex` class.
