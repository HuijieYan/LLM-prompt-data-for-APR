### Analysis
The `PeriodIndex` class includes a `_engine` function that is intended to return a new instance of the `_engine_type` class, which requires a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance. However, the current implementation is not correctly creating the weak reference, leading to the issue described on GitHub.

### Error Location
The issue lies in the `_engine` function where the weak reference to `self` is not created correctly.

### Bug Cause
The bug is causing the `_engine` function to return `None` instead of the expected `_engine_type` instance due to the weak reference to `self` not being properly implemented. This results in the failing test as observed in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the `_engine` function needs to correctly create a weak reference to `self` before passing it to the `_engine_type` constructor.

### Corrected Version
```python
from pandas.util._decorators import Appender, cache_readonly, doc

# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By fixing the creation of the weak reference to `self` within the `_engine` function, the issue described in the GitHub thread should be resolved, and the failing test should pass successfully.
