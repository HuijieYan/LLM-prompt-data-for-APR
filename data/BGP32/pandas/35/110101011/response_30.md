### Analysis
The `PeriodIndex` class has a `_engine` method that is expected to return an instance of `_engine_type`. The issue reported on GitHub suggests that when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`, weakrefs are lost, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

### Error Location
The bug lies in the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class, specifically in how weak referencing is handled.

### Cause of the Bug
The `_engine` method attempts to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object but incorrectly stores it in the `period` variable without maintaining the weak reference. As a result, when the `PeriodEngine` is instantiated with `period`, it receives `None` instead of a reference to the `PeriodIndex`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
The `_engine` method should maintain a weak reference to `self` throughout its lifetime so that it remains available when used by the `PeriodEngine`.

### Updated Buggy Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` method:

```python
# Updated corrected version of the buggy _engine method
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))  # Corrected to maintain weak reference
```

By making this change, the weak reference to `self` is maintained until `period()` is called, ensuring that the `PeriodEngine` receives a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex`.

This correction should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` passes successfully.
