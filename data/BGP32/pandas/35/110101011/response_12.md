### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is an instance of `PeriodIndex`.
2. The `PeriodIndex` class is designed to hold ordinal values indicating regular periods in time. The `_engine` function seems to be related to some engine type used for PeriodIndex operations.
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is trying to create a `MultiIndex` from level values of a `PeriodIndex`. The test fails due to losing weak references during the process.
4. The bug seems to be related to the weak reference creation and subsequent usage.
5. The correct behavior should involve maintaining the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `_engine` function is creating a weak reference to `self` (an instance of `PeriodIndex`), but the weak reference is not being maintained or used properly. When the weak reference is passed to `_engine_type`, it receives `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex` instance, leading to incorrect behavior and causing the test to fail.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` remains valid while being used in the `_engine` function. One possible approach is to store the weak reference in a class attribute so that it is not garbage collected prematurely.

### Corrected Version
```python
# Fixing the bug in the _engine function of the PeriodIndex class
def _engine(self):
    if not hasattr(self, '_period_weakref'):
        self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference to `self` in the `_period_weakref` attribute of the `PeriodIndex` instance, we ensure that the reference is maintained until it is used in the `_engine_type` call. This approach should address the issue reported in the failing test case and the corresponding GitHub issue.
