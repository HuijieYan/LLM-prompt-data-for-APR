Based on the information provided, the issue seems to be related to the usage of weak references in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The weak reference to `self` is being created but not maintained properly, leading to a `None` value being passed to `self._engine_type` on engine creation.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is preserved throughout the lifespan of the `_engine` function. One way to achieve this is by storing the weak reference in a class attribute that can be accessed by the `_engine` function consistently.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    if not hasattr(self, '_period_weakref'):
        self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    
    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

This fix ensures that the weak reference to `self` is stored in the `_period_weakref` attribute of the `PeriodIndex` instance and accessed consistently when creating the engine. This approach should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` passes successfully.
