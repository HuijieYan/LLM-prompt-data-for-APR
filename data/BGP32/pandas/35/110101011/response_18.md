### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance. However, the weak reference created is not being utilized correctly, leading to potential garbage collection of the weakly referenced object.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is related to the issue mentioned in the GitHub report, where weak references in `PeriodIndex` are lost, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of weak references in the `_engine` function. When the weak reference `period` is created in the `_engine` function, it is not preserved and may be garbage collected prematurely.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the weak reference to `self` should be stored in an instance attribute to prevent it from being garbage collected before being used by the `_engine_type`. By doing so, the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object will be maintained throughout the `_engine` function's execution.

### Corrected Version of the `_engine` Function
```python
# Corrected version of the _engine function
def _engine(self):
    # Store a weak reference of self in an instance variable
    self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    # Pass the weak reference to _engine_type
    return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference to `self` is now stored in the instance attribute `self._period_ref`, ensuring it remains reachable throughout the `_engine` function's execution.

By implementing this fix, the reported GitHub issue related to weak reference loss in `PeriodIndex` levels on a `MultiIndex` should be resolved, and the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` should pass successfully.
