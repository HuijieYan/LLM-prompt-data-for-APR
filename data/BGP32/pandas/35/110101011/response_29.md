### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using a weak reference incorrectly, causing the `_engine_type` constructor to receive `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex` instance. This behavior is leading to the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` in the MultiIndex, as it involves creating a new MultiIndex from existing data in the `PeriodIndex`.

### Potential Error Locations
1. Incorrect usage of `weakref` in the `_engine` function.
2. Passing `period` to `_engine_type` might not be working as intended due to weak references.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect implementation of the weak reference usage in the `_engine` function. When the weak reference `period` is passed to the `_engine_type` constructor, it might not be resolving to the `PeriodIndex` instance properly, resulting in `None` being passed instead.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly apply the weak reference in the `_engine` function so that it maintains a reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance. This will ensure that the `_engine_type` constructor receives the actual `PeriodIndex` instance instead of `None`.

### Corrected Version
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Keep a strong reference to self to avoid the weakref being garbage collected
    period = self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By maintaining a strong reference to `self` in the `_engine` function, we ensure that the `PeriodIndex` instance is correctly passed to the `_engine_type` constructor instead of a weak reference that could resolve to `None`.
