### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is utilizing weak references to prevent reference cycles, but the weak reference is not being correctly passed to `_engine_type`. This results in the PeriodIndex object being dropped before intended, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving `None` instead of the actual PeriodIndex object.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the weak reference not being properly maintained throughout the `_engine` function, causing it to be lost before being passed to `_engine_type`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
Ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex object is correctly maintained and passed to `_engine_type` to prevent it from being dropped prematurely.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By updating the `_engine` function to correctly maintain the weak reference `period` throughout its execution, the bug should be resolved, and the test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` should pass successfully.
