## Analysis
### Issue Description:
The bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class is causing weak references to be lost, leading to incorrect behavior when constructing a `MultiIndex`.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the `_engine` function when creating a weak reference to `self`.

### Cause of Bug:
The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref()` incorrectly, which does not hold a reference to `self` securely, causing the weak reference to be lost.

### Proposed Fix Strategy:
1. Avoid using `weakref.ref()` directly in the `_engine` function to prevent weak reference loss.
2. Ensure that the `_engine` function receives a valid reference to `self` to maintain the weak reference.

### Correction:
Below is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

This correction directly passes `self` to the `_engine_type` constructor, ensuring that a valid reference is maintained without using `weakref.ref()`.

By implementing this fix, the weak reference issue should be resolved, and the failing test related to weak references in `MultiIndex` construction should pass successfully.
