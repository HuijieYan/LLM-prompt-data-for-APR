### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class returns an instance of `_engine_type` by passing a weak reference of `self` (the `PeriodIndex` instance) and the length of the `PeriodIndex` instance.
2. The test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods` from `test_get_level_values.py` creates a `MultiIndex` with a `PeriodIndex` as one of its levels and then attempts to retrieve level values, which triggers the issue related to weak references.
3. The issue on GitHub highlights that copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` causes the weakrefs to be lost, leading to an incorrect behavior in accessing level values.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises from the fact that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance `self` is not maintained properly, leading to it being lost before the intended use in the `_engine_type`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained throughout the usage in the `_engine` function so that it remains valid when creating the `_engine_type` instance.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)  # Keep a weak reference to self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By maintaining the weak reference to `self`, the corrected version of the function should preserve the reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance when creating the `_engine_type`, resolving the weak reference issue.
