### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using a weak reference for the `self` object and then passing it to `_engine_type`. The issue seems related to weak references not being maintained properly.
2. The weak reference `period` is created but not utilized effectively, leading to incorrect behavior.
3. The failing test is related to copying `PeriodIndex` levels on a `MultiIndex`, which results in weak references being lost.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is maintained throughout the function and correctly passed to `_engine_type`.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the weak reference `period` not being used correctly and being lost before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This leads to incorrect behavior when copying levels of a `PeriodIndex` on a `MultiIndex`.

### Proposed Fix
To fix the bug, we should modify the `_engine` function to properly maintain the weak reference `period` and ensure it is passed correctly to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version of the `_engine` function
```python
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))  # Pass period() to get the actual object
```

By calling `period()` before passing it to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the weak reference is correctly resolved to the actual object before being used in the `PeriodEngine`, fixing the bug. This corrected version should resolve the issue reported in GitHub and pass the failing test.
