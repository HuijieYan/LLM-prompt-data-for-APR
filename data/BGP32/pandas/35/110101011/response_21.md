### Analysis
The issue seems to be related to the use of weak references in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The function creates a weak reference to the `self` object, which is a `PeriodIndex`, and then passes it to the `_engine_type` constructor. However, due to the way weak references work, the reference might be lost prematurely, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Potential Error Location
The error might be related to the usage of `weakref.ref(self)` in the `_engine` function. The weak reference might not be kept alive long enough to be used effectively in the `_engine_type`.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug likely occurs because the weak reference to `self` is being lost before it can be used in the `_engine_type` constructor. This can result in `period` being `None` when `_engine_type` tries to access it, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is kept alive until it is actually used in the `_engine_type` constructor. One way to achieve this is by storing the weak reference as an instance attribute or passing it in as an argument when it is actually needed.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

In this corrected version, we store the weak reference in `self._period_ref` as an instance attribute, ensuring that it is kept alive as long as the `PeriodIndex` object itself. This should prevent premature loss of the weak reference and resolve the issue.
