### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is trying to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance and pass it to `_engine_type`. However, the weak referencing is not correctly implemented, causing the reference to be lost.
2. The failing test involves creating a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` and then checking if the levels are monotonic, which fails due to the weak referencing issue in `PeriodIndex`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by a weak reference not being maintained properly in the `_engine` function. When the weakref is created, it is lost before being passed to `_engine_type`, making it resolve to `None`, causing unexpected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is properly maintained until it is passed to `_engine_type`. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference in a variable that persists during the lifetime of the `_engine` function call.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    """
    Immutable ndarray holding ordinal values indicating regular periods in time.
    
    Index keys are boxed to Period objects which carries the metadata (eg,
    frequency information).
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    data : array-like (1d int np.ndarray or PeriodArray), optional
        Optional period-like data to construct index with.
    copy : bool
        Make a copy of input ndarray.
    freq : str or period object, optional
        One of pandas period strings or corresponding objects.
    year : int, array, or Series, default None
    ...
    """
    
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Maintain the weak reference
        self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference in the class instance (`self._period_weakref`), we ensure that it remains valid throughout the `_engine` function call, fixing the weak referencing issue. This corrected version should resolve the problem described in the GitHub issue and make the failing test pass.
