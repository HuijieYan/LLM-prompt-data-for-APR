### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class currently returns an instance of `_engine_type` initialized with a weak reference to `self`. However, the weak reference is not utilized correctly, leading to `None` being passed instead of the intended `PeriodIndex` object to `_engine_type`.

### Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is that the weak reference is not maintained properly in the `_engine` function. When the weak reference `period` is created using `weakref.ref(self)`, it doesn't hold a strong reference to prevent `self` from being collected. This results in the weak reference pointing to an object that has already been garbage collected, leading to the engine receiving `None`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the weak reference `period` needs to be managed properly to ensure that `self` is kept alive until it is no longer needed. One way to achieve this is by storing the weak reference object in an instance attribute.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a strong reference to self to prevent it from being garbage collected
    self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

With this modification, the weak reference is stored in the `_period_ref` attribute of the `PeriodIndex` instance, ensuring that `self` is kept alive until the engine is initialized correctly.

By implementing this fix, the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved, and the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` should pass successfully.
