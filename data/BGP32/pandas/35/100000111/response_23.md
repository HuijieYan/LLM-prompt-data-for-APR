The bug in the `_engine` function is caused by passing a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type` without properly accessing the weakly referenced object. This results in `_engine_type` receiving a `weakref` object instead of the expected `self` object, leading to unexpected behavior and potential errors.

To fix the bug, we need to access the referenced object from the `weakref` before passing it to `_engine_type` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Access the referenced object from the weak reference
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` instead of passing `period` directly to `_engine_type`, we correctly access the referenced `self` object from the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`.

This correction ensures that the expected `self` object is properly passed to `_engine_type`, resolving the issue and ensuring the function behaves as expected in the provided test case.
