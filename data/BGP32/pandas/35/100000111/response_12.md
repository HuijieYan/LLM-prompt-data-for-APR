## Analyzing the buggy function

The `_engine` function is implemented as a `cache_readonly` function that returns the engine type using a weak reference to the instance of the class. The function seems to store the weak reference in the 'period' variable, but it's not utilized further in the function as intended.

## Error location

The usage of the weak reference `period` is not accurately captured, leading to an issue in passing the weak reference to the `_engine_type` in the subsequent code.

## Cause of the bug

The bug arises from not correctly utilizing the weak reference that was intended to avoid reference cycles. This bug causes the `_engine_type` function to receive `None` instead of the expected weak reference.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, the weak reference `period` needs to be used correctly in passing it to the `_engine_type` function. Ensure that the weak reference to the instance (`self`) is maintained throughout the function to prevent unnecessary garbage collection.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we actually call `period()` to obtain the weakly referenced object before passing it to the `_engine_type` function. This change ensures that `period` is correctly used as intended, avoiding the bug described.
