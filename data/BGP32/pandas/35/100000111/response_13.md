The bug in the `_engine` function is related to the use of `weakref.ref(self)`. The intention is to pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`, but due to the way `weakref.ref` is used, the weak reference is not properly maintained, leading to issues when accessing it later on.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly maintained throughout the function execution. One simple approach is to store the weak reference in a variable and then extract the reference when needed.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Properly maintain the weak reference of self
    weak_self = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weak_self, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference in the `weak_self` variable, we ensure that it is not garbage collected prematurely. This should resolve the issue and provide the expected behavior as described in the GitHub issue.
