The bug in the `_engine` function is caused by passing a `weakref.ref` object of `self` (PeriodIndex) to `_engine_type` instead of the actual `self` object. This results in `None` being passed to `_engine_type` instead of the PeriodIndex, leading to unexpected behavior as described in the GitHub issue.

To fix this bug, we need to properly access the original `self` PeriodIndex object before passing it to `_engine_type`. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Get a strong reference to self to prevent it from being garbage collected
    period = self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This corrected version ensures that the actual `self` object is passed to `_engine_type`, preventing the issue described in the GitHub problem.
