To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly maintained until it is used by `_engine_type`. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference to `self` in a local variable within the `_engine` function and then passing this local variable to `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a weak reference of self in a local variable
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference in a local variable `period_ref`, we ensure that the reference to `self` is not lost prematurely before being used by `_engine_type`. This modification should resolve the issue and ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is retained until needed by the `PeriodEngine`.

The corrected function now properly maintains the weak reference and should satisfy the expected input/output values as described in the GitHub issue.
