To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly maintained until the engine is constructed. The issue seems to stem from the weak reference being dropped prematurely, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a `None` instead of the intended PeriodIndex.

To address this issue, we can modify the `_engine` function to utilize the weak reference in a way that maintains a strong reference until the engine is instantiated. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Access the weak reference directly to prevent it from being dropped prematurely
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In this corrected version, the weak reference `period` is accessed directly when constructing the engine, ensuring that the reference is still valid when needed. This change should prevent the issue described in the GitHub bug report and maintain the expected behavior when creating the engine.
