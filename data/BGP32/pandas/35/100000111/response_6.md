The buggy function `_engine` is supposed to return an engine object based on a weak reference to the provided `self` object. However, the current implementation is not correctly creating a weak reference to `self`, leading to potential issues when the engine object is returned.

The issue reported on GitHub ("BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs") highlights a problem where weak references are dropped prematurely, causing unexpected behavior when checking for monotonicity in the levels of a `MultiIndex` constructed from a `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, the weak reference creation needs to be adjusted to ensure that it remains valid until the engine object is created. Additionally, the `self._engine_type` call should handle the weak reference properly to avoid potential None returns.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self to prevent reference cycles
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    # Access the engine type using the weak reference
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    return engine_type
```

This corrected version addresses the bug by properly creating and utilizing a weak reference to `self`. This should prevent premature dropping of weak references and ensure the engine object is initialized correctly.
