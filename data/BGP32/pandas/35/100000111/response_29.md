## Analysis
The `@cache_readonly` decorator used in the `_engine` function indicates that the function's result should be cached, meaning the function should only be executed once and then return the same result for subsequent calls. The bug is likely related to how weak referencing is handled within the `_engine` function.

## Identified Bug
The bug is within the `_engine` function where the weak reference is not properly handled. The line `period = weakref.ref(self)` creates a weak reference to `self`, but it is not passed correctly to the `_engine_type` function.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug causes the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object to be dropped prematurely, leading to `None` being passed to the `_engine_type` function instead of the actual `PeriodIndex` object. This results in unexpected behavior, as seen in the GitHub issue where an error is raised when checking for monotonicity.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the weak reference created should be maintained until it is properly passed to the `_engine_type` function. This can be achieved by ensuring that the weak reference is accessed within the `_engine` function when creating the `period` object, and then using this weakly referenced object when calling `_engine_type`.

## Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_weakref(), len(self))
```

By capturing `self` using `period_weakref()` when calling `_engine_type`, the weak reference is utilized correctly, ensuring that the `PeriodIndex` object is passed and maintained as expected. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and provide the correct output for the given test cases.
