Based on the GitHub issue description and the expected input/output values provided, the bug in the `_engine` function seems to be related to the weak reference to `self` being lost before it is intended to be used. This results in the `period` variable being None when passed to `_engine_type`, causing unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `period` retains a reference to `self` throughout the `_engine` function's execution.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, retain a reference to self in a local variable.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we store the weak reference to `self` in the `period_ref` variable and pass `period_ref` to `_engine_type` instead of directly passing `weakref.ref(self)`. This change ensures that the weak reference is maintained until it is used within `_engine_type`, preventing it from becoming None prematurely.
