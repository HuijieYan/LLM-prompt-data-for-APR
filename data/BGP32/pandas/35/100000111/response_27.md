## Analysis
The `_engine` function is supposed to return an instance of the period engine using a weak reference to the `self` object (which is a `PeriodIndex`). However, the current implementation is creating a weak reference to `self` incorrectly, resulting in the period engine getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

## Potential Error Locations
1. The incorrect usage of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object.
2. Passing the weak reference instead of the actual `self` object to the `_engine_type` function.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug in the `_engine` function is causing the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to be passed incorrectly to the `_engine_type` function. This results in the `_engine_type` function receiving `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the correct way to create a weak reference to the `self` object should be used, and the actual `self` object should be passed to the `_engine_type` function instead of the weak reference.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to the self object
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)` in the function, we ensure that the weakly referenced `self` object is passed correctly to the `_engine_type` function, resolving the issue and providing the expected behavior as described in the GitHub issue.
