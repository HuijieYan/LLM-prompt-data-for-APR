## Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is meant to return an instance of `self._engine_type` by passing a weak reference of `self` and the length of `self`. However, the current implementation of creating a weak reference using `weakref.ref(self)` and passing it to `_engine_type` might be causing the issue.

## Error Locations:
1. Creating a weak reference of `self` using `weakref.ref(self)` is not the correct way to pass a weak reference to `_engine_type`.
2. The weak reference created is not stored in a variable, so it may not be available when needed.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is causing the `_engine_type` to receive a weak reference that is not correctly created and stored, leading to `None` being passed instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Create a weak reference using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)` to maintain a reference to the object.
2. Store the weak reference in a variable to ensure it is available when needed.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference using weakref.proxy
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
