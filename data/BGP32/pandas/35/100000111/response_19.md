## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is a `PeriodIndex` object. This weak reference is intended to prevent a reference cycle. However, the bug occurs because the weak reference is not being used correctly in the `_engine_type` call, resulting in passing `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex` object.

## Identified Issue
The bug in the `_engine` function lies in how the weak reference is being handled. The `period = weakref.ref(self)` line creates a weak reference object, but when passing it to `self._engine_type`, it should be dereferenced to obtain the actual `PeriodIndex` object. This dereferencing is not happening in the current implementation, leading to passing `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex` object.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to dereference the weak reference `period` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This can be achieved by calling the `period` object like a function, which will return the original `self` object.

## Corrected Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference `period` is dereferenced using `period()` before passing it to `_engine_type`, ensuring that the actual `PeriodIndex` object is provided as intended.
