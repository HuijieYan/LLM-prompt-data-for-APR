To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, we need to ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is maintained throughout the function execution. The issue arises because the weak reference `period` is binding to the local variable `period` which gets garbage collected when the function `_engine` finishes its execution.

To resolve the issue, we can update the `_engine` function to properly maintain the weak reference. We can achieve this by storing the weak reference in a class attribute that is accessible even after the function returns. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a weak reference to self in a class attribute
    self._weakref_period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    # Pass the weakly referenced self to _engine_type
    return self._engine_type(self._weakref_period, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference in the `self._weakref_period` attribute, we can ensure that the reference is not lost when the `_engine` function completes. This way, the weak reference will be available during the execution of the `self._engine_type` function, resolving the issue described in the GitHub bug report.

The corrected function should now maintain the weak reference properly and provide the expected output values for the given test case.
