To fix the buggy function, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly passed to `_engine_type`. In the current implementation, the weak reference is not correctly used, leading to the issue mentioned in the GitHub problem description.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference `period` is not being correctly utilized within the `_engine` function. When `self` is passed as a weak reference to `_engine_type`, it should handle the weak reference correctly to avoid losing the reference to `self`. The current implementation does not ensure this, resulting in the issue where the `PeriodEngine` receives `None` instead of a valid `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the weak reference is accessed correctly within the `_engine` function. We should dereference `period` before passing it to `_engine_type` to ensure that the reference to `self` is maintained.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `period` is dereferenced by calling it as a function `period()` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This ensures that the weak reference is properly utilized, preventing the reference cycle issue.
