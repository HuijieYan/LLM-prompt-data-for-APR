## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is intended to return an instance of `_engine_type` class with a weak reference to `self`. However, the issue arises when the weak reference `period` is being created using `weakref.ref(self)`, but it is not being used correctly while passing it to `_engine_type` class. This results in `None` being passed instead of the expected `self` object, causing the bug.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the weak reference `period` is created but not correctly dereferenced when passed to `_engine_type`, leading to a `None` object being used instead of the actual `self` object.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to dereference the weak reference `period` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This will ensure that the actual `self` object is passed to the constructor of `_engine_type`.

## Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

In the corrected version, the `period` weak reference is invoked with `()` to dereference it and return the actual object referenced by `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This ensures that the correct `self` object is used in the construction of `_engine_type`.
