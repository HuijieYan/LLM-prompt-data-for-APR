To fix the bug in the provided function, we need to correctly pass the weakly referenced `self` to `_engine_type` function to avoid any reference cycle issues. The bug seems to be related to the creation and usage of `weakref.ref(self)` in the `_engine` function. To resolve the issue, we should make sure to correctly handle the weak reference creation.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

Explanation of the corrected code:
- Changed `weakref.ref(self)` to `weakref.proxy(self)` to correctly create a weak reference to `self`.
- Passing `period` to `_engine_type` ensures that the `self` reference is weakly referenced while being used by the `_engine_type` function.

By making this change, we ensure that the `self` reference in the `_engine` function is correctly weakly referenced, addressing the issue of losing weakrefs in `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`, as reported in the GitHub issue.
