## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is attempting to create a weak reference to `self` (a `PeriodIndex` object) and then use it to instantiate a new object using `self._engine_type`. The bug seems to be related to how weak references are being handled, possibly resulting in a `None` value being passed to `_engine_type`.

## Error Location
The issue likely stems from the weak reference creation with `weakref.ref(self)` not being properly utilized in the subsequent instantiation of `self._engine_type`.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is likely causing the weak reference to be dropped prematurely, resulting in a `None` value being passed to `_engine_type` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the weak reference creation with `weakref.ref(self)` should be appropriately used when instantiating `self._engine_type`. Ensuring that the weak reference remains valid throughout the process will help address the issue.

## Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` after creating the weak reference, we ensure that the weak reference is still valid when passed to `_engine_type`, resolving the issue of passing `None` instead of `PeriodIndex`.
