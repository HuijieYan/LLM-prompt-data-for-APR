#### Fixing the Bug

**Analysis:**

The bug is caused by passing a weak reference of `self` (`PeriodIndex`) to the `_engine_type` method. The weak reference is not used correctly, leading to a `None` value being passed instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**

1. Instead of creating a weak reference to `self`, pass `self` directly to the `_engine_type` method.
2. Update the `_engine` method to correctly pass the `PeriodIndex` object to the `_engine_type` method.

**Corrected Version:**
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Pass self directly to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
``` 

By directly passing the `self` object (PeriodIndex) to the `_engine_type` method in the corrected version, the bug is fixed. This change ensures that the `PeriodIndex` object is correctly used by the `_engine_type` method.
