To fix the bug in the provided `_engine` function, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly maintained, preventing it from being garbage collected prematurely. The issue mentioned on GitHub indicates that weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` objects are being dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None`.

To address this issue, we can modify the `_engine` function to keep a strong reference to the weakly referenced `self` object until it is used in the `PeriodEngine`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In this corrected version, we use `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref` to maintain a strong reference to `self` until it is accessed within the `_engine_type` function. This ensures that the `PeriodIndex` object is not prematurely garbage collected before being used by the `PeriodEngine`.
