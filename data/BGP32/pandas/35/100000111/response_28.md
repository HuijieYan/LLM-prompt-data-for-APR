## Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine(self)` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference of `self` (which is expected to be a `PeriodIndex` object) and then passing it along with the length of `self` to `_engine_type` method. The issue seems to be related to the weak reference handling, leading to `None` being passed to `_engine_type` instead of the `PeriodIndex` object.

### Identified Potential Error:
The potential error lies in the usage of `weakref.ref(self)`, which may not correctly create a weak reference to `self` leading to the observed behavior.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the function is causing the weak reference to `self` to not be maintained correctly, resulting in `None` being passed to `_engine_type` instead of the actual `PeriodIndex` object. This leads to unexpected behavior and errors in subsequent processing.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly maintained throughout the function execution. This can be achieved by revisiting the use of `weakref.ref(self)` and ensuring that the weak reference is valid when passed to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

### Explanation of the Fix:
In the corrected version, `period` is called with `()` to obtain the actual `PeriodIndex` object from the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`. This ensures that the weak reference is correctly resolved, and the expected `PeriodIndex` object is passed to `_engine_type`.

By making this adjustment, the corrected function should now correctly handle the weak reference and provide the expected behavior, resolving the issue described in the GitHub problem statement.
