## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`. However, in the reported issue, the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is getting dropped before the intended use, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

## Potential Error Location
The issue seems to be with the weak reference handling in the `_engine` function. If the weak reference is not maintained correctly, the `PeriodIndex` object might get destroyed prematurely.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug arises because the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object is not being maintained properly, leading to its destruction before it is accessed in the `_engine_type` call. This results in the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, ensure that the weak reference to `self` (the `PeriodIndex` object) is being maintained throughout the function's execution until it is accessed inside `_engine_type`. This will prevent the `PeriodIndex` object from being prematurely destroyed.

## Corrected Version
```python
from pandas.util._decorators import Appender, cache_readonly, doc

# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)  # Maintain weak reference
    result = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return result
``` 

By maintaining the weak reference until it is accessed inside `_engine_type`, this corrected version ensures that the `PeriodIndex` object is not prematurely destroyed, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
