To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, we need to make sure that the weak reference to the `self` object (`PeriodIndex`) is correctly passed to the `_engine_type` constructor. In the current buggy implementation, a weak reference is created but not used in the `_engine_type` call, leading to unexpected behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

Explanation of the fix:
- We now pass the weak reference object `period` by calling `period()` in the `_engine_type` call. This ensures that the weakly referenced `self` object (`PeriodIndex`) is correctly retained during the `_engine_type` creation process.

By implementing this fix, we ensure that the weak reference to the `self` object is maintained and correctly used in the `_engine_type` constructor, addressing the issue reported on GitHub related to weakrefs being lost when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`.

The corrected function should now satisfy the expected input/output values provided in the GitHub issue.
