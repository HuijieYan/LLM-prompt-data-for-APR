To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is maintained correctly throughout the function. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped prematurely, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To address this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` remains alive until it is used within the `_engine_type` function initialization.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))()
```

By adding parentheses `()` after `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, we are ensuring that the weak reference is not dropped prematurely and remains alive until the `PeriodEngine` instance is created.

This correction should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the expected behavior of the function is maintained.
