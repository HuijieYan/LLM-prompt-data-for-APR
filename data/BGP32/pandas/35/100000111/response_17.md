Based on the given information, the bug in the `_engine` function is caused by creating a weak reference to `self` without storing it properly. This results in `period` holding a reference to `self` weakly, but since it is not maintained, it loses the reference once the function returns. As a result, `self` is garbage collected prematurely, leading to the issue described in the GitHub problem statement.

To fix this bug, we need to store the weak reference `period` in a variable that persists beyond the function scope. One common approach is to create an instance variable to hold the weak reference. By doing so, we ensure that the weak reference remains valid outside the function call, preventing premature garbage collection.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference in `self._period_ref`, we maintain a valid reference to `self` throughout the object's lifespan. This change should resolve the bug and prevent the premature garbage collection issue described in the GitHub problem statement.
