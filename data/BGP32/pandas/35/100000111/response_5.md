## Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` function that is meant to return the engine type for a given `PeriodIndex` object by passing a weak reference of the `PeriodIndex` object to the `_engine_type` constructor. The issue reported on GitHub involves losing weakrefs when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on a `MultiIndex`, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Error:
The error in the current implementation lies in creating a weak reference in the `_engine` function. On inspecting the code, the weak reference is created incorrectly, resulting in a None value being passed to the `_engine_type` constructor.

## Cause of the bug:
The issue arises due to how weak references are being utilized in the `_engine` function. By not holding a strong reference to the weakly referenced `Period` object, the weak reference becomes invalid before it is passed to the `_engine_type` constructor.

## Fix strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference remains valid until it is passed to the `_engine_type` constructor. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference to the `Period` object as an attribute of the `Period` object itself.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference as an attribute of the Period object
    self._weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._weak_period, len(self))
``` 

By storing the weak reference as an attribute of the `Period` object, we ensure that the weak reference remains valid until it is passed to the `_engine_type` constructor, addressing the issue of losing weakrefs during level copying on a `MultiIndex`.
