## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is supposed to return the result of calling `_engine_type` with a weak reference to `self` and the length of `self`. However, it seems to be creating `period` as a weak reference incorrectly since `weakref.ref()` should be called with the object to be referenced, not a value.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by how the weak reference is being created in the `_engine` function. Instead of passing `self` to `weakref.ref()`, the function is passing the value of `self`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to create a weak reference to the `self` object correctly by passing `self` to `weakref.ref()`.

## Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Correctly create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By correcting the line where the weak reference is created, the corrected version of the function should now return the expected output as defined in the GitHub issue.
