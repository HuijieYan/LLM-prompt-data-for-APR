## Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is a cache readonly function that is supposed to return a weakly referenced version of the `PeriodIndex` object to avoid a reference cycle. However, the current implementation is creating a weak reference to `self` incorrectly, causing the function to return `None` instead of the intended `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.

## Error:
The issue lies in the incorrect creation of the weak reference to `self` within the `_engine` function.

## Bug Cause:
The bug causes the weak reference to `self` in the `_engine` function to be created incorrectly, resulting in a `None` value being returned instead of the proper `PeriodIndex` object.

## Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, a proper weak reference to `self` needs to be created, ensuring that the weak reference retains the reference to the `PeriodIndex` object correctly.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Properly creating a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if period() is not None else None
```
