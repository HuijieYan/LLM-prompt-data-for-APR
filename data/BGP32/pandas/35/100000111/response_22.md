## Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is aiming to create a weak reference to the `self` instance and pass it to the `_engine_type` method. However, the implementation seems incorrect as it directly creates a weak reference without considering the object's reference cycle properly.

## Error location:
The issue lies in the line `period = weakref.ref(self)`, which directly creates a weak reference without handling the reference cycle properly.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the weak reference to `self` is not handled correctly, which leads to the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before intended.

## Fix strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the weak reference is created and handled. We should ensure that the weak reference persists until it's no longer needed.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, we create a proxy object that keeps the weak reference alive until `self` is no longer needed, thus addressing the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report.
