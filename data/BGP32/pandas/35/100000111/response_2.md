## Analysis
The `_engine` function is supposed to create a weak reference of the `self` object and pass it to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`. However, the bug in the current implementation is that it creates a weak reference of `self` but does not pass it correctly to `_engine_type`. This leads to a reference cycle issue and causes unexpected behavior as described in the GitHub issue.

## Error Location
The bug lies in the way the weak reference object `period` is used in the return statement. The `period` needs to be dereferenced correctly before passing it to `self._engine_type`.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug causes the weak reference to be lost before it reaches `_engine_type`, leading to a None value being used instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to properly dereference the weak reference object before passing it to `_engine_type`. This can be achieved by calling the `period` object to get the actual reference before passing it to `_engine_type`.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By modifying the return statement to dereference the weak reference object `period` before passing it to `_engine_type`, we can fix the bug and satisfy the expected input/output values provided in the GitHub issue.
