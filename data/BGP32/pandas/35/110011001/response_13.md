### Analysis
- The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to avoid a reference cycle and then returning the result from `_engine_type`.
- However, the error message indicates an AttributeError in the return statement of `_engine`, suggesting an issue with the returned value.
- The error message specifically points to the `view("i8")` method call on a `NoneType`, indicating that the returned value from `_engine_type` is `None`.

### Bug
The bug is in the `_engine` function where the return value from `_engine_type` is not correctly assigned or created, leading to a `NoneType` being returned instead of the expected object.

### Fix
To fix the bug, ensure that the `_engine` function correctly returns an instance of the `_engine_type` class instead of `None`.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# Corrected _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_instance = self._engine_type(period, len(self))

    if engine_instance is None:
        raise ValueError("Failed to create engine instance")

    return engine_instance
``` 

By ensuring that the `_engine` function returns a valid instance of `_engine_type` or raises an exception if it fails to create one, we can fix the bug and pass the failing test.
