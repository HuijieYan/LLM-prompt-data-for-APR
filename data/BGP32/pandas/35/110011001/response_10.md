### Cause of the bug:
In the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class, `weakref.ref(self)` is used to create a weak reference to the `self` object. However, the return statement `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))` is passing `self` instead of the weak reference `period`. This results in inadvertently creating a reference cycle, which causes unexpected behavior and the AttributeError when accessing attributes of the `_engine` object.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
The bug can be fixed by passing the weak reference `period` instead of `self` to the `_engine_type` constructor. This will prevent the reference cycle and resolve the AttributeError when accessing attributes of the `_engine` object.

### Corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
