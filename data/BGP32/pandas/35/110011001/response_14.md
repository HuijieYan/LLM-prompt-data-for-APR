### Explanation:
The error occurs when trying to access the `is_monotonic` attribute of the `idx2.levels` in the failing test. This triggers a chain of calls that eventually leads to the `_engine` attribute, which in the buggy function is not correctly implemented.

In the buggy function, the `_engine` function returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, where `period` is a weak reference to `self`. However, the weak reference `period` is not correctly assigned as intended. This causes the `_do_monotonic_check` method to fail when trying to access the values of the index.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` correctly references `self` so that it can be used in the `_engine_type` call without issues.

### The corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `period` is now called as a function `period()` to get the actual object that `self` refers to before passing it to `_engine_type`. This change ensures that the weak reference correctly points to the `self` object.
