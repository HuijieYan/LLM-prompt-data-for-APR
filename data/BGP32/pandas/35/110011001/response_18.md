### Potential Error Locations
1. The `_engine` function returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, which implies that `self._engine_type` is expected to be a valid type.
2. The usage of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` might lead to reference cycle issues.

### Bug Explanation
The error message indicates an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, pointing to an issue in accessing an attribute on a `NoneType` object. This suggests that `self._engine_type` inside the `_engine` function might be returning `None` instead of an expected engine object, leading to the attribute access error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that `self._engine_type` returns a valid engine object and not `None`.
2. Check for any reference cycle issues caused by the use of `weakref.ref(self)`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is not None:
        return engine
    else:
        raise ValueError("Engine type is None.")
```

By explicitly checking if the `self._engine_type` returns a valid engine object and handling the case of it being `None`, we can prevent the `AttributeError` and ensure that a correct engine object is returned by the `_engine` function.
