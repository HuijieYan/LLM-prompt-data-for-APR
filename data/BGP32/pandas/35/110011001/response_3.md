### Analysis
- The `_engine` function is meant to return an instance of the `_engine_type` class with a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object.
- The error message indicates that the `_engine` function encounter an AttributeError when trying to call `view("i8")` on the return value, which is likely a `NoneType`.
- This suggests that the `_engine_type` constructor is not returning the expected object.
- Possible reasons for such behavior could be incorrect initialization or implementation of the `_engine_type` class.

### Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by the `_engine_type` constructor not properly initializing and returning the expected object. This results in `self._engine` being set to `None` instead of an instance of `_engine_type`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, ensure that the `_engine_type` constructor returns the correct object type and initializes it properly before returning.

### Corrected Version
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Initialize and return the correct instance of _engine_type
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        engine_instance = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
        if engine_instance is None:
            raise ValueError("Failed to create _engine instance")
        return engine_instance
```

By making sure that the `_engine_type` constructor correctly creates and returns an instance of the required object, the bug should be resolved.
