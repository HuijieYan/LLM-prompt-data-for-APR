### Issue Analysis
1. The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is using a weak reference to `self` to create the `_engine_type` object.
2. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` where a `NoneType` object has no attribute 'view'.
3. The problem seems to be in the creation of the `_engine_type` object, as it might be returning `None`.
4. The weak reference to `self` might not be working correctly, leading to the `NoneType` error.
   
### Proposed Fix
1. Instead of using a weak reference to `self`, pass `self` directly to `_engine_type` to create the object.
2. This should ensure that the `_engine_type` object is correctly created and avoids the `NoneType` error.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
