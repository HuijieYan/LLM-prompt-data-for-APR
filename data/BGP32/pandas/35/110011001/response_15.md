### Analysis
- The `_engine` function is attempting to create a weak reference to the `self` object (an instance of `PeriodIndex`) and then return an instance of `_engine_type` using the weak reference and the length of the `self` object.
- The error message indicates an `AttributeError` with the message `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, suggesting that the `_engine` function is returning `None` instead of an instance of `_engine_type`.
- The issue might be with the weak reference creation and usage in the `_engine` function.

### Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by the weak reference creation. The weak reference created with `period = weakref.ref(self)` is not being used correctly to create the `_engine_type`.

### Fix Strategy
1. Modify the creation of the weak reference to ensure its proper usage.
2. Update the return statement to correctly use the weak reference object to create an instance of `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version
```python
# Corrected _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_weakref, len(self))
```
