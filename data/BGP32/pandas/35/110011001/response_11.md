### Cause of the Bug
The bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class is caused by the return statement `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. The `weakref.ref` function is used to create a weak reference object, but it is not used correctly in this context. As a result, when trying to access attributes or methods of the weak reference object later, it leads to an `AttributeError` because the weak reference object has been dereferenced.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to correctly use the weak reference object created by `weakref.ref` to avoid a circular reference without dereferencing it prematurely. The weak reference object should be passed as an argument when creating the `_engine_type`. This way, we can access the original object safely without causing any attribute errors.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_weakref, len(self))
``` 

By modifying the function as shown above, we correctly create a weak reference object `period_weakref` and pass it to `_engine_type`, ensuring that the original object can be accessed safely without causing attribute errors.
