### Bug Explanation
The error occurs when trying to access the `view()` method on a `NoneType` object in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. This leads to the `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error message during execution.

### Bug Location
The issue lies in the `_engine` function where the `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` call returns `None`, causing the subsequent error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine_type` function returns an appropriate object instead of `None`.

### The corrected version of the `_engine` function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    # Check if the engine creation was successful
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("Engine creation returned None")
    
    return engine
``` 

By checking if the engine object returned by `_engine_type` is `None`, we can ensure that the correct engine object is generated, preventing the `AttributeError` from occurring.
