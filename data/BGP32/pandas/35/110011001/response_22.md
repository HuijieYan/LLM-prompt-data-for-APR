### Analyzing the buggy function
The buggy function `_engine` is a cache readonly function that returns the engine type based on the input `self` (which is an instance of `PeriodIndex`). The engine type is constructed using the weak reference of `self` and the length of `self`. 

### Identifying the issue
The error message indicates an `AttributeError` with a `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`. This suggests that the `_engine` function is returning `None` instead of the expected engine type. This could be due to the weak reference usage causing an issue in retrieving the actual reference to the object.

### Cause of the bug
The bug is likely caused by the weakref usage in creating the `period` variable, which is expected to refer to `self` (an instance of `PeriodIndex`). Due to the weak reference, the actual reference might not be correctly retrieved, leading to the `_engine` function returning `None` instead of the engine type.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the weak reference creation correctly refers to `self` without losing the reference. We can achieve this by changing how the weakref is created or accessed within the `_engine` function.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = self
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By removing the `weakref.ref(self)` and directly assigning `self` to the `period` variable, we ensure that the actual reference to the object is retained. This should resolve the issue with the `_engine` function returning `None`.
