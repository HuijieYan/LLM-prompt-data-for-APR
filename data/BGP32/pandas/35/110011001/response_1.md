### Analysis
The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is defined as a `@cache_readonly` function. It is intended to return an instance of the `_engine_type` class using a weak reference to the `self` object (an instance of `PeriodIndex`). The error message indicates that there is an issue with attribute access, specifically `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`. This suggests that the `self._engine_type` is not being set correctly within the function.

### Bug Location
The issue is likely to be with the weak reference creation `period = weakref.ref(self)` line, where it should be used to construct the `_engine_type` object. If the weak reference is not correctly maintained or accessed, it could lead to the `_engine_type` being `None`.

### Bug Explanation
The error message 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view' suggests that the `_engine_type` attribute set in the `_engine` function is actually `None`. This causes an attribute error when trying to access `view`. This issue can happen if the weak reference `period` is not correctly used when creating the `_engine_type` object.

### Bug Fix
To fix this issue, you should ensure that the weak reference `period` is being properly used to construct the `_engine_type` object. One way to ensure this is to retrieve the actual object from the weak reference before using it. This can be done using `period()`. 

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Retrieve the actual object from the weak reference
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This change ensures that the weak reference is appropriately resolved before creating the `_engine_type` object, preventing the issue of `_engine_type` becoming `None`.
