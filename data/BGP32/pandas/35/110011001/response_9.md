### Explanation
- The `_engine()` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is supposed to return an instance of the `_engine_type` class initialized with a weak reference to `self` and the length of `self`.
- The error occurs when trying to access the `view` attribute on a `NoneType` object, indicating that the `_engine_type` is not being initialized correctly.
- The `period` variable should be created as a weak reference to `self` correctly, but it seems that the weak reference is not being used appropriately when initializing `_engine_type`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Ensure that the weak reference `period` is correctly passed to the `_engine_type` constructor to avoid a reference cycle issue.
- Modify the `_engine` function to correctly utilize the weak reference to `self` when initializing the `_engine_type`.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
