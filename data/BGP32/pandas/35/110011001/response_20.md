### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is trying to create an instance of the `_engine_type` class using a weak reference to `self`. However, the weak reference creation is causing an issue, leading to an AttributeError when trying to access an attribute of a NoneType object.

### Error Cause:
The weakref.ref() method is returning a weak reference object, not the actual object itself. Therefore, when trying to access an attribute of the weak reference object, it results in the AttributeError because it does not have the attribute.

### Solution:
Instead of creating a weak reference object in the `_engine` function, it is recommended to directly pass `self` to the `_engine_type` constructor. This way, the `_engine_type` will have a reference to the actual `PeriodIndex` object, avoiding the weak reference issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected _engine function in the PeriodIndex class
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
``` 

By directly passing `self` to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the correct object is passed without creating a weak reference. This should resolve the AttributeError issue and allow the tests to pass successfully.
