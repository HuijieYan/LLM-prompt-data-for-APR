### Potential Error Locations
1. The `weakref.ref(self)` line inside the `_engine` function might not be correctly handling the reference to `self`.
2. The `_engine_type` function might not be correctly initializing the engine, leading to a `NoneType` error.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug seems to be related to the weak reference management of `self` inside the `_engine` function. The error message indicates that the `NoneType` object is missing the attribute 'view', suggesting that the `_engine` function is returning `None` instead of the expected engine object. This could be due to an issue with the weak reference handling.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly handled and that the `_engine_type` function initializes and returns the engine object properly.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type failed to initialize the engine object")
    return engine
``` 

By adding a check after `_engine_type` call and explicitly raising an error if the engine object is still `None`, we ensure that the engine is properly initialized and returned. This fix should resolve the issue of the `NoneType` object missing the 'view' attribute.
