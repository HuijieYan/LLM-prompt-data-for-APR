### Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` decorator function within the `PeriodIndex` class. It creates a weak reference to the `self` object (an instance of `PeriodIndex`) and then calls the `_engine_type` method with the weak reference and the length of `self`.

### Issues with the buggy function

1. The error message indicates that there is an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`. This implies that the `view` operation is being attempted on a `NoneType` object, leading to the error.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

The issue is likely related to the `_engine_type` method returning `None` instead of an expected object. To fix the bug, ensure that `_engine_type` method returns a valid object, allowing the subsequent method calls (`self._do_monotonic_check()`, `self._get_index_values()`, etc.) to work correctly.

### Corrected version of the `_engine` function

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    if engine_type is not None:
        return engine_type
    else:
        # Handle the case where _engine_type returns None
        raise ValueError("_engine_type method returned None")
``` 

By handling the case where `_engine_type` returns `None`, this corrected version of the function should prevent the `AttributeError` related to calling `view` on a `NoneType` object.
