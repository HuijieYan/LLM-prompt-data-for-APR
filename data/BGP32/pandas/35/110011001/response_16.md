### Analysis
The error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` class is returning a `NoneType` object when trying to access the `view` attribute, leading to an `AttributeError`. This is happening when the `is_monotonic_increasing` property of the PeriodIndex class is accessed.

Looking at the `_engine` function in the PeriodIndex class, it seems that the issue might be related to the `_engine_type` function not properly returning an instance of the `PeriodEngine`. This could be due to a problem with the weak reference usage inside the `_engine` function.

### Bug Cause
The `_engine_type` function may not be correctly handling weak references, causing it to return `None`.

### Fix
Adjust the way the weak reference is passed to the `_engine_type` function to ensure that it correctly creates an instance of the `PeriodEngine` without returning `None`.

### Corrected Code
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period(), len(self))  # Corrected line
    if engine is not None:
        return engine
    else:
        raise ValueError("Failed to create PeriodEngine instance")
