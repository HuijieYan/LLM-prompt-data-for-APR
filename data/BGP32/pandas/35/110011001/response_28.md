### Analysis
The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance `self`. However, the issue arises when `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` is called, and there seems to be a problem related to the 'NoneType' object not having the 'view' attribute. This indicates that the `_engine_type` method is returning `None` instead of an expected object.

### Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by the `_engine_type` method not returning the expected object when called with `period` and `len(self)` as arguments. This leads to an 'AttributeError' when trying to access the 'view' attribute on a 'NoneType' object.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, you need to ensure that the `_engine_type` method returns the correct object instance instead of 'None'. 

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the `_engine` function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type method should not return None")
    return engine
``` 

By incorporating the check for `None` return value from `_engine_type`, the corrected version will avoid the 'AttributeError' when trying to access a method on a 'NoneType' object.
