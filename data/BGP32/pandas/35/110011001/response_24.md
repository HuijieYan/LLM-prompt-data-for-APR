### Analysis
The `_engine()` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is attempting to create a weak reference to the `self` object (which is an instance of `PeriodIndex`) and then pass it along with the length of the index to a constructor method `_engine_type`. The bug seems to be related to the weak reference creation and usage.

The error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` object is encountering an issue when trying to access its underlying values. This error is most likely occurring due to the weak reference being used improperly or not being accessed correctly.

### Bug Cause
The bug seems to be caused by how the weak reference is created and used within the `_engine()` function. The incorrect usage of the weak reference is leading to the `NoneType` error when trying to access data from the `PeriodEngine` object.

### Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that the weak reference is properly created within the `_engine()` function to avoid the reference cycle issue.
2. Update the return statement to correctly pass the weak reference and the length of the `PeriodIndex` object to the `_engine_type` constructor.

### Corrected Code
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```

By fixing the weak reference creation and return statement as shown above, the issue with the `NoneType` error should be resolved.
