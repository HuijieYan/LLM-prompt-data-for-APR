### Analysis
- The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is trying to create an instance of `_engine_type` by passing a weak reference of `self` and the length of the index.
- The error message indicates that there is an issue with accessing an attribute (`view`) on a `NoneType` object, implying that the `_engine` attribute is not being set correctly.

### Bug Cause
- The `_engine` method is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. The issue lies in the fact that `weakref.ref()` returns a weak reference object, and when the `_engine_type` function is called later, it receives this weak reference object instead of the `self` object.

### Fix Strategy
- Instead of using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, we should pass `self` directly to `_engine_type` to ensure correct attribute access.
- Change the return statement in the `_engine` method to `return self._engine_type(self, len(self))`.

### Corrected Code
```python
    # corrected version of the buggy function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
