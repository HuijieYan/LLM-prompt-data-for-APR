### Explanation
The error message indicates an issue with the `PeriodEngine` class's `is_monotonic_increasing` method, specifically with the `vgetter()` method returning a `NoneType` object where an attribute `view` is being accessed, resulting in an `AttributeError`.

Looking at the buggy function `_engine`, the issue seems to stem from how the `Period` object is being used as a weak reference. When creating a weak reference using `weakref.ref(self)`, it only references the object, but does not keep it alive. This means that when `_engine` is called later, the weak reference may no longer be pointing to a valid object, leading to the error observed.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this issue, we need to make sure that the weak reference to `self` remains valid when `_engine` is called. One approach is to store a strong reference to `self` before creating the weak reference, ensuring that the object stays alive during the `_engine` function call.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a strong reference to self to keep the object alive
    period_object = self
    period = weakref.ref(period_object)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
