### Analysis
The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is trying to create a weak reference to `self` and then return an instance of `_engine_type` with the weak reference and the length of `self`. The error message indicates that there is an issue with trying to access the `view` attribute of a `NoneType` object, which means that the `_engine` function is returning `None` instead of the expected object of `_engine_type`.

### Potential Bug Location
The issue seems to be with how the weak reference to `self` is being handled or how `_engine_type` is being initialized.

### Bug Explanation
The `_engine` function is probably not correctly creating the instance of `_engine_type` with the weak reference and length of `self`, leading to it returning `None` instead of an instance of `_engine_type`. This causes the subsequent error when the code tries to access attributes on the returned object.

### Bug Fix Strategy
Ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly passed to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self` to create a proper instance of `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
