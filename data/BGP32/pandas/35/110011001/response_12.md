### Explanation
The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `view` attribute in the `_do_monotonic_check` function of the `IndexEngine` class. This error is triggered when trying to access the `view` attribute on a `NoneType` object, meaning that the `_engine` attribute returned `None` instead of the expected `PeriodEngine` object.

Upon analyzing the code, we can see that the `_engine` function is using a `weakref` internally to hold a reference to `self`, the `PeriodIndex` object. However, the usage of `weakref.ref` is incorrect in this context, leading to the `None` return value.

### Bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref` in the `_engine` function, which results in the `_engine` function returning `None` instead of a `PeriodEngine` object.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to properly create a weak reference to the `self` object and use it to instantiate the `PeriodEngine`. We can achieve this by modifying the `_engine` function as follows:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This fix uses `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`, ensuring that the `_engine` function returns the expected `PeriodEngine` object.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
