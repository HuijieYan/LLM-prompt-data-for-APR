The bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class is related to the creation and return of the `_engine_type` object. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` with a message `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, which suggests that the `_engine_type` is returning `None`, leading to the error when trying to access the `view` attribute on it.

The cause of the bug seems to be in the way the reference to `self` is passed to `_engine_type`. The use of `weakref.ref(self)` creates a weak reference to `self`, which needs to be dereferenced properly while creating the `_engine_type` object.

To fix this bug, we need to properly dereference the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`. Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Dereference the weak reference to self before passing to _engine_type
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we are dereferencing the weak reference to `self` and passing a direct reference to the `_engine_type` constructor. This should fix the bug and prevent the `AttributeError` that was occurring.

After applying this fix, retest the failing test case to ensure that the corrected version of the function now passes the test successfully.
