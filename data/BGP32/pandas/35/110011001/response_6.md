### Analysis
The error occurs in the `is_monotonic_increasing` method when trying to access the `_engine` attribute, which is returning `NoneType`. This means that the `_engine` method is not returning the expected `PeriodEngine` instance, leading to the AttributeError.

### Bug Cause
The `_engine` method is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, where `self._engine_type` is expected to be an instance of `PeriodEngine`. However, in this buggy implementation, it seems that `PeriodEngine` is not instantiated properly or is not being returned as expected, leading to the `NoneType` error.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine` method correctly instantiates and returns an instance of `PeriodEngine`. One possible solution is to directly instantiate `PeriodEngine` within the `_engine` method and return it.

### Corrected Code
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return PeriodEngine(period, len(self))
```
