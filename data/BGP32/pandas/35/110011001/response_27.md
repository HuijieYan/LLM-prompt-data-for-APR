### Case 1 Analysis
- The input parameter `self` is a `PeriodIndex` object containing two periods: '2019Q1' and '2019Q2'.
- The value passed to the `PeriodEngine` constructor is a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object.
- The bug seems to be related to how the weak reference is handled in the `_engine` method.

### Bug Explanation
- The error message indicates that a 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'. This suggests that the `_do_monotonic_check` method is attempting to access a 'NoneType' object as if it had the 'view' attribute.
- The issue is likely caused by how the weak reference is used or processed in the `_engine` method.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is properly handled to avoid returning a 'NoneType' object.
- Check the implementation of the `_engine_type` constructor to ensure it can correctly handle the weak reference object.

### Updated Function
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if self is not None else None
```

By adding a check to return `None` if `self` is `None`, we can prevent the issue with a 'NoneType' object in the `_do_monotonic_check` method.
