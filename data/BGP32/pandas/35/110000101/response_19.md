### Analysis
The bug in the `_engine` method is that it is attempting to create a weak reference to the `self` object, but due to the way it's implemented, it is actually creating a weak reference to the `self` object and not to the `PeriodIndex` instance which leads to a reference cycle problem.

### Bug cause
The `_engine` method is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`. However, `self` here refers to the method itself instead of the `PeriodIndex` instance. This creates a circular reference issue which prevents proper garbage collection and can lead to memory leaks.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance instead of the method itself.

### Corrected code
```python
    # this is the corrected version of the function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Create a weak reference to the PeriodIndex instance
        period_index_ref = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period_index_ref, len(self))
```
