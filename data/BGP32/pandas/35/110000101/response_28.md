The buggy function `_engine` is trying to return an instance of `_engine_type` using a weak reference to `self`. However, the `weakref.ref(self)` creates a weak reference object that needs to be dereferenced in order to access the original object. 

To fix this bug, we need to dereference the weak reference object before passing it to `_engine_type`. This can be done by calling the weak reference object `period` with `()`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)()
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By dereferencing the weak reference object `period` with `()`, we are able to access the original `self` object and pass it to `_engine_type` as intended.
