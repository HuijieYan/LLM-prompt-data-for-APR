The issue with the buggy function `_engine` is that it is not correctly handling the weak reference to the PeriodIndex instance `self`. 

The `weakref.ref()` function returns a weak reference object, which is essentially a proxy object that does not increase the reference count of the referent. In this case, the weak reference `period` should be dereferenced before passing it to `_engine_type`.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the return statement to dereference the weak reference `period` using `()` to access the referent.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference `period` is accessed using `()` to get the referent `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`, ensuring that the reference count is not increased and preventing reference cycles. This will fix the bug in the original function.
