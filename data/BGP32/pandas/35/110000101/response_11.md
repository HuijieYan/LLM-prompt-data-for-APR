## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using a weak reference `weakref.ref` to create a reference to the `self` object. However, the weak reference is not being correctly returned from the function, leading to a potential reference cycle issue. The function is expected to return the `_engine_type` initialized with the weak reference and the length of the `self` object.

The cause of the bug is that `weakref.ref` is not being properly handled and assigned to `period` before being passed to `_engine_type`. This can result in the weak reference not being saved and subsequently not being used for the `_engine_type`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to properly save the weak reference created by `weakref.ref(self)` to the `period` variable before passing it to `_engine_type`. This will ensure that the reference cycle is correctly handled by using the weak reference.

## Corrected Function
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
