The bug in the `_engine` function is that it tries to create a weak reference to `self` but does not store this reference in a variable. This results in the weak reference being immediately garbage collected, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to store the weak reference to `self` in a variable before passing it to `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    weak_self = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weak_self, len(self))
``` 

By storing the weak reference in the variable `weak_self`, we ensure that the reference is not garbage collected prematurely and can be used in the `_engine_type` method as intended.
