The bug in the provided function `_engine` is that it incorrectly uses `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to self. The correct approach for creating a weak reference with weakref module is to use `weakref.proxy(self)`. 

The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref(self)` which creates a weak reference to the object itself, rather than being able to access attributes of the object. This leads to potential issues when trying to access attributes or methods of the object through the weak reference.

To fix this bug, the function `_engine` should be updated to use `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`.

Here is the corrected version of the function `_engine`:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.proxy(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This correction ensures that a weak reference is created correctly, allowing safe access to the attributes and methods of the object.
The corrected function should now work as expected with the given inputs and produce the desired output.
