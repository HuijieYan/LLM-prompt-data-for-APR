The bug in the provided function `_engine` is that it attempts to create a weak reference to `self`, but the reference is not properly stored. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential issues related to memory management.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the way the weak reference is created and stored. We should store the weak reference in a variable so that it's not immediately garbage collected.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference in the `period_ref` variable, we ensure that the reference is valid and can be used by `_engine_type` as needed.

This correction addresses the potential issue of the weak reference not being properly retained, ensuring that the function works as intended with the expected input and output values specified in the test cases.
