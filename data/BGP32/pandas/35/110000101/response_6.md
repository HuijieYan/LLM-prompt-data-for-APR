The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` incorrectly. The intention appears to be to avoid creating a reference cycle by passing a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`. However, weak references should be created using `weakref.ref` on the object instance itself, not on a property of the object.

To fix the bug, we should create a weak reference of the object instance directly, instead of trying to create a weak reference of `self`. This will ensure that the weak reference does not prevent the object from being garbage collected when no references to it exist.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to the object instance
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By making this change, the function will correctly return an instance of `_engine_type` with the weak reference to the object instance, avoiding reference cycles correctly.
