Based on the provided buggy function and the expected input/output values, it seems that the bug lies in the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class. The `_engine` function is using weak references to avoid reference cycles, but it is incorrectly implemented which leads to potential issues when creating the `_engine_type` object.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the usage of weak references and ensure that the `period` variable correctly refers to the `self` object without creating issues.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Create a strong reference to self to avoid premature garbage collection
        period = weakref.proxy(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we use `weakref.proxy` to create a strong reference to `self` instead of `weakref.ref`. This ensures that the reference to `self` is maintained throughout the execution of the `_engine` function, preventing premature garbage collection of `self`.
