The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object, which is the `PeriodIndex` object. However, the intention seems to be passing the weak reference to `_engine_type` instead of the `self` object directly to avoid reference cycles.

The bug occurs because `weakref.ref(self)` is used incorrectly. The `weakref.ref()` function creates a weak reference object pointing to `self`, but it does not return an actual reference to `self`. To obtain a weak reference to `self`, the correct approach is to call `weakref.ref(self)()`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the line `period = weakref.ref(self)` to `period = weakref.ref(self)()`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
