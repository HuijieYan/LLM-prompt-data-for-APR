The bug in the `_engine` function is that it incorrectly uses `weakref.ref` on `self` which is causing the weak reference to be lost immediately after being created. This results in a weak reference cycle not being broken as intended.

To fix this bug, we need to properly create a weak reference to `self` and then pass that weak reference to the `_engine_type` constructor. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, create a weak reference to self and pass it to _engine_type.
    weak_self = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weak_self, len(self))
```

By creating a weak reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the reference cycle is properly broken and the weak reference is retained as intended.
