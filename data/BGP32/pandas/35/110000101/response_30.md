The bug in the provided function is that it does not correctly create a weak reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This can potentially lead to a reference cycle issue.

To fix this bug, we need to use `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
