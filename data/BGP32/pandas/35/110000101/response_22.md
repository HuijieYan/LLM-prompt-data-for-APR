The bug in the provided function `_engine` is that it attempts to create a weak reference of `self` with `weakref.ref(self)`, but then instead of passing this weak reference object (`period`) to `_engine_type`, it incorrectly passes `self` itself.

To fix this bug, we need to pass the weak reference object `period` to `_engine_type` to avoid creating a reference cycle.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By passing the weak reference `period` to `_engine_type`, we ensure that there is no reference cycle created, resolving the bug in the function.
