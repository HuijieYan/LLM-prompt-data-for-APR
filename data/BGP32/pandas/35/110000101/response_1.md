The bug in the `_engine` function lies in the `weakref.ref(self)` call, which creates a weak reference to the `self` object. This weak reference is then passed to the `_engine_type` constructor. However, since the weak reference is not stored, it immediately gets garbage collected, leading to unexpected behavior or memory leaks.

To fix this bug, we should store the weak reference in a variable to ensure that it remains alive for the duration of `_engine` function execution.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Pass the stored weak reference to _engine_type
    period_ref = period()
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

This corrected version stores the weak reference to `self` in the `period` variable and retrieves it immediately after. This ensures that the `self` object remains alive during the `_engine` function execution.
