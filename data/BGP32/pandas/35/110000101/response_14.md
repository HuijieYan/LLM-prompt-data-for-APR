The current bug in the `_engine` function is that it is not correctly creating a weak reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This can lead to a reference cycle issue and prevent proper garbage collection.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to use `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref` when creating a weak reference to `self`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref.proxy of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.proxy(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By using `weakref.proxy(self)`, we ensure that a weak reference is created without preventing the garbage collection of the `self` object. This fix should prevent potential reference cycle issues and accurately reflect the expected behavior for the given input values and types.
