The bug in the function `_engine` is that it is using `weakref.ref(self)` incorrectly. The `weakref.ref()` function should be used to create a weak reference to an object, but it should not be assigned to a variable to be used later. Instead, it should be used directly when needed.

To fix the bug, we should directly pass the weak reference to `_engine_type` without assigning it to a variable.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```

This correction ensures that a weak reference to the `self` object is passed to `_engine_type` as intended.
