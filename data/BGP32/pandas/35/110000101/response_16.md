The bug in the provided function `_engine` is that it is not correctly returning an instance of the `_engine_type` class. The `weakref.ref(self)` is creating a weak reference to `self`, but it should be passing `self` directly to `_engine_type` instead.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the `weakref.ref(self)` line and pass `self` directly to `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By making this change, the function will now correctly return an instance of the `_engine_type` class with the input `self` as intended. This correction ensures that the expected input/output values provided for the function are met.
