The bug in the provided function `_engine` is that it is attempting to use `self` directly inside a `cache_readonly` decorator, which can lead to a circular reference issue. To fix this bug, we should use a `functools.cached_property` instead of `cache_readonly` to create a cached property that depends on the instance.

Using `cache_readonly` in this context can create a circular reference which can lead to memory leak issues in certain scenarios.

Here is a corrected version of the `_engine` function using `functools.cached_property` instead:

```python
from functools import cached_property

@cached_property
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `functools.cached_property`, we ensure that the property is only computed once and cached for the lifetime of the instance, avoiding potential circular reference issues.
