The bug in the `_engine` function lies in the line `period = weakref.ref(self)` where a weak reference to `self` is being created. The issue is that `weakref.ref()` returns a weak reference object, not the actual reference to the object. This means that when `period` is used later in `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, it is not referencing the `self` object correctly.

To fix this bug, we need to directly pass `self` to `_engine_type` without creating a weak reference.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
