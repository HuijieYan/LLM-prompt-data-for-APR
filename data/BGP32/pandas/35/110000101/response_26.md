Based on the provided buggy function and the expected values of its parameters, it seems that the `_engine` function should return an instance of the `_engine_type` class with a weak reference to the `self` object (which is an instance of `PeriodIndex`).

The bug in the current implementation is that `weakref.ref(self)` is not used correctly. The `weakref.ref` function simply creates a weak reference to the `self` object, but it does not actually reference the `self` object itself. When `period` is used later in the `_engine_type` call, it doesn't provide the actual `self` object.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the way the weak reference is utilized. We can achieve this by using the `weakref.proxy` function, which returns a proxy object that references the original object.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly use a weak reference to the `self` object when calling the `_engine_type` constructor. This will prevent any potential reference cycles and ensure the expected behavior of the function.
