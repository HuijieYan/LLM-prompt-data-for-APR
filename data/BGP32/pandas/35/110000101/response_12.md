The bug in the provided function `_engine` is that it is trying to create a weak reference to `self` in the `period` variable, but it is not actually creating a weak reference correctly. This can lead to potential reference cycle issues.

To fix the bug, we need to create a weak reference correctly by passing `self` directly to `weakref.ref` without assigning it to `period`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```

By making this change, the function now correctly creates a weak reference to `self` and passes it to `_engine_type`, which should help avoid potential reference cycle issues.
