The buggy function `_engine` is attempting to create a weak reference to the `self` object and then pass it to the `_engine_type` method. The issue with the current implementation is that the weak reference is not being correctly assigned to `period` due to missing the parentheses when calling `weakref.ref(self)`.

To fix the bug, we need to assign the weak reference correctly to `period` by adding the parentheses to invoke the `weakref.ref(self)` function and create a weak reference object.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference `period` will correctly reference the `self` object when passed on to the `_engine_type` method.
