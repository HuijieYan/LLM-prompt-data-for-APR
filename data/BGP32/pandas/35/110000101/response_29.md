The bug in the provided function `_engine` is that it returns the `_engine_type` object using a weak reference to `self`, which leads to a weak reference object being passed as the `period` parameter instead of the actual `self` object.

This can cause issues when accessing attributes or methods of the `self` object within the `_engine_type` constructor, as the weak reference object may not hold a reference to the actual `self` object.

To fix this bug, we should directly pass `self` as the `period` parameter to the `_engine_type` constructor.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By directly passing `self` to the `_engine_type` constructor, we ensure that the actual `self` object is used to create the `_engine_type` object, rather than a weak reference object.
