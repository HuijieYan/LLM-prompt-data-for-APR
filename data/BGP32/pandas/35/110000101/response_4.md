## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is trying to create an instance of `_engine_type` by passing `period` and the length of `self`. However, the way it tries to capture a reference to `self` using `weakref.ref` is incorrect.

The `weakref.ref` function returns a weak reference object pointing to `self`, which is not the intended behavior here. The correct approach should be to pass `self` directly to `_engine_type`.

## Bug Cause
The bug in the `_engine` function is caused by passing a weak reference to `self` instead of `self` directly to `_engine_type`, which leads to incorrect behavior in the subsequent usage of `self` within `_engine_type`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should pass `self` directly to `_engine_type` instead of converting it to a weak reference.

## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function _engine
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
``` 

By making this change, we ensure that `self` is passed correctly to `_engine_type`, allowing the function to work as intended.
