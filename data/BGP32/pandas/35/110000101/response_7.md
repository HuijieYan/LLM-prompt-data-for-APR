The bug in the provided function `_engine` is that it is trying to create a weak reference to `self` by using `weakref.ref(self)`, but it is not handling the weak reference correctly. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential reference cycles.

To fix this bug, we need to correctly handle the weak reference creation for `self` and then pass it to `_engine_type` function along with the length of `self` index.

Here is the corrected version of the function `_engine`:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    weakref_self = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weakref_self, len(self))
```

This corrected version ensures that the weak reference to `self` is created correctly and passed to the `_engine_type` function along with the length of the PeriodIndex `self`.

By making this change, the function `_engine` should now correctly handle the weak reference to `self` and avoid any potential reference cycle issues.
