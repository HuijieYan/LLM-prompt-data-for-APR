The bug in the provided function `_engine` is related to the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`. The intention here is to pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type` to avoid a reference cycle, but the usage is incorrect.

The problem lies in the line:
```python
period = weakref.ref(self)
```

In this line, the `weakref.ref` function is used incorrectly. The `weakref.ref` function returns a weak reference object, not the weak reference itself. To obtain the weak reference, you need to call the `period` object which should be part of the object creation in the next line.

To fix the bug, you should modify the function as follows:
```python
# this is the corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `period()` is called to retrieve the weak reference, which is then passed to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`. This ensures that a weak reference to `self` is correctly passed to `_engine_type`.

With this correction, the function should now behave as expected based on the provided input/output specifications.
