The bug in the provided function `_engine` is that it is trying to create a weak reference `period` to `self` incorrectly. The correct way to create a weak reference is to use `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`. Using `weakref.ref` creates a weak reference object which needs to be dereferenced later to access the actual object, leading to potential issues.

To fix the bug, we can replace `period = weakref.ref(self)` with `period = weakref.proxy(self)` in the `_engine` function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref.proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
