## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self`, which is a `PeriodIndex` object.
2. The purpose of using `weakref.ref(self)` is to prevent reference cycles and potential memory leaks.
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is checking if the resulting `MultiIndex` created from a `PeriodIndex` retains the expected properties.
4. The GitHub issue points out that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped prematurely, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None`.
5. To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until needed by the `PeriodEngine`.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by premature dropping of the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex`, resulting in `None` being passed to the `PeriodEngine`.

## Fix Strategy:
Ensure that the weak reference to the `self` object is stored in a way that prevents it from being garbage collected before being used by the `PeriodEngine`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, store a weak reference of self in a class attribute.
    if not hasattr(self, '_weak_period'):
        self._weak_period = weakref.ref(self)

    return self._engine_type(self._weak_period, len(self))
```
