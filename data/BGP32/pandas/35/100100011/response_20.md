The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` (PeriodIndex), which is then passed to the `_engine_type` constructor. The issue is that the weak reference is not being properly maintained, leading to a `None` value being passed to `_engine_type` instead of the intended PeriodIndex. This causes the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` to raise an error.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is maintained correctly throughout the function. We can achieve this by modifying the `_engine` function as follows:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Correctly maintaining the weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    # Checking if the weak reference actually refers to an object
    if period() is None:
        raise RuntimeError("Weak reference to self is None")
    
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By making sure that the weak reference `period` refers to an existing object before passing it to `_engine_type`, we can prevent passing `None` accidentally, resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub thread.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods`.
