The bug in the `_engine` function is due to the weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` not being maintained properly, leading to `self` being garbage collected before being used in `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. This results in `self` being `None` in the `_engine_type` call, causing the function to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is properly retained and accessed when needed. We can achieve this by modifying the function as follows:

```python
# The corrected version of the function

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Retrieve the object referenced by the weak reference
    period_obj = period()
    if period_obj is None:
        raise RuntimeError("Weakly referenced object is no longer available")
    return self._engine_type(period_obj, len(self))
```

This corrected version of the function first retrieves the object from the weak reference `period`, checks if it is `None`, and if not, passes it to the `_engine_type` function. This ensures that the weak reference object is correctly accessed and used to prevent the garbage collection issue.

With this fix in place, the provided failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` should now pass without any errors, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
