## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is a cached property that returns an instance of `_engine_type` by passing a weak reference of `self` (PeriodIndex) to it. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` loses weak references, resulting in a `None` being passed to the `PeriodEngine`. This causes an error when checking if the level values are monotonic.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the weak reference to `self` (PeriodIndex) in the `_engine` method is mistakenly created using `weakref.ref` instead of `weakref.proxy`. This causes the weak reference to be lost when copied to a `MultiIndex`, leading to passing `None` to `PeriodEngine`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, `weakref.proxy` should be used to create the weak reference to the `self` PeriodIndex object. This will ensure that the weak reference is correctly maintained even when copied to other objects like `MultiIndex`. 

## Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By correcting the function as shown above, the weak reference to `self` will be correctly maintained even when dealing with `MultiIndex`, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
