The bug in the `_engine` function is that it creates a weak reference to `self` named `period`, but it should keep a strong reference to `self` until the engine is created. In the current implementation, the weak reference is being dropped before intended, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a `None` instead of the intended PeriodIndex object.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `self` is kept alive until the engine is created. This can be achieved by storing `self` in a local variable before creating the weak reference. Then pass the local variable to the engine type and proceed with creating the engine.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The fixed version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a strong reference to self before creating a weak reference
    period = self
    ref_period = weakref.ref(period)
    return self._engine_type(ref_period, len(self))
```

This modification ensures that `self` is maintained until the engine is created, preventing the weak reference from becoming invalid prematurely. This fix should resolve the issue reported in GitHub and make the failing test pass.
