### Analysis:
1. The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` which is then passed to `_engine_type`.
2. The weak reference `period` is not being properly retained, leading to it being garbage collected prematurely.
3. The cause of the bug is that the weak reference `period` is short-lived due to it being created locally within the `_engine` function. This causes it to be garbage collected before being used in `_engine_type`, resulting in `None` being passed instead of the intended reference to `self`.
4. To fix the bug, the weak reference `period` needs to be retained beyond the local scope of the `_engine` function.

### Updated version of the `_engine` function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Maintain a reference to the weakref to prevent it from being garbage collected
    self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference `period` in `self._period_ref`, it ensures that the weak reference is maintained and not garbage collected prematurely. This resolves the issue of passing `None` to `_engine_type`.

Now the corrected function should work as expected and pass the failing test provided in the GitHub issue.
