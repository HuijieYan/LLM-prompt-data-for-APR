## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object. However, the usage is incorrect as it creates a weak reference to the value returned by `self`, not to `self` itself.
2. The issue reported on GitHub describes the problem with weak references in the context of copying `PeriodIndex` levels in `MultiIndex`, leading to losing weak refs.
3. The bug originates from incorrectly creating a weak reference in the `_engine` function, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.
4. To fix the bug, the correct approach is to create a weak reference to `self` directly in the `_engine` function.

## Bug Fix:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By correcting the weak reference creation in the `_engine` function to directly refer to `self`, the bug should be resolved, and the corrected function should now correctly handle weak references as intended.
