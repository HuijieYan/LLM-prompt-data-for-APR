## Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` uses `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference of the `self` object and then passes this weak reference to `_engine_type`. However, the issue is that when the weak reference is created, it is not kept alive, resulting in the weak reference losing its reference. This behavior causes `_engine_type` to receive `None` instead of the actual `self` object, leading to unexpected behavior in the code.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `weakref.ref` method creates a weak reference without keeping it alive, leading to the weak reference losing its reference before being utilized by `_engine_type`. This behavior results in `_engine_type` receiving `None` instead of the intended `self` object.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, instead of creating a weak reference using `weakref.ref(self)`, we can use `weakref.proxy(self)` to create a proxy object that retains a reference to the original object. This way, when `_engine_type` is called with the proxy object, it will receive the actual `self` object.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# Fix for the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use weakref.proxy to create a proxy object that retains a reference
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By replacing `weakref.ref(self)` with `weakref.proxy(self)` in the `_engine` function, we ensure that the weak reference retains a reference to the original object, preventing it from losing its reference prematurely. This correction should resolve the issue described in the GitHub report and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
