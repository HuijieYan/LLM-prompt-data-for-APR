## Analysis:
- The `_engine` function is supposed to create a weak reference to `self` (in this case, a `PeriodIndex`) and pass it to `_engine_type`. However, the weak reference creation is not done correctly in the original function.
- The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` with `PeriodIndex` levels and tries to retrieve level values from it, which results in an error due to the incorrect weak reference handling in `_engine`.
- The GitHub issue explains that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped prematurely, causing `_engine_type` to receive `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect creation of the weak reference in the `_engine` function. The `period = weakref.ref(self)` line should be `period = weakref.ref(self)()` to correctly create a weak reference object.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly create a weak reference object by invoking the `weakref.ref(self)` call. This will ensure that the `PeriodIndex` object is weakly referenced without being dropped prematurely.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By correcting the weak reference creation, the corrected version of the function should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
