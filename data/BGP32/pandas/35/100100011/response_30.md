### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` uses `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is an instance of a class. This is intended to avoid creating a reference cycle and help with garbage collection.
2. The failing test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods` involves creating a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex`, which utilizes the `_engine` function. The test checks if certain properties hold for the resulting `MultiIndex`.
3. The GitHub issue highlights that weakrefs are being dropped prematurely when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`, leading to a `None` instead of the expected reference.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is managed properly in the `_engine` function to avoid it being dropped prematurely.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the weak reference to `self` created in the `_engine` function is not being used appropriately. When copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`, the weak reference is being dropped prematurely, resulting in a `None` being passed to `PeriodEngine` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference created using `weakref.ref(self)` in the `_engine` function remains valid until it is used within `PeriodEngine`. This involves maintaining the reference throughout the function's execution.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from pandas.util._decorators import Appender, cache_readonly, doc
import weakref

# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Maintain the weak reference until it is used in PeriodEngine
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine
```

By modifying the `_engine` function as shown above, the weak reference to `self` will be retained until it is passed to `PeriodEngine`, addressing the premature dropping issue and ensuring the correct behavior for copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`.
