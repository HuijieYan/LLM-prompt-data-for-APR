### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is utilizing `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object (presumably a `PeriodIndex` instance) and pass it to `_engine_type`. The function then returns the result of `_engine_type` with the weak reference and length of `self`.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` involves creating `MultiIndex` objects from `PeriodIndex` instances, and then checking if the levels of the resulting `MultiIndex` objects are monotonic. The issue described on GitHub indicates that the weak reference to `PeriodIndex` is being dropped prematurely, causing `_engine_type` to receive `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the weak reference created using `period = weakref.ref(self)` is not being utilized correctly. When the weak reference `period` goes out of scope or is otherwise discarded before being used in `_engine_type`, it leads to `None` being passed instead of the actual `PeriodIndex`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until it is used in the call to `_engine_type`. This can be achieved by storing the reference in a class attribute or a closure within the `_engine` function itself, so that it remains alive until the call to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    def get_weakref():
        return weakref.ref(self)
    
    period_ref = get_weakref()
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

With the corrected version of the `_engine` function, the weak reference to `self` is stored in a closure and used when calling `_engine_type`. This ensures that the reference remains valid until it is needed, resolving the issue described on GitHub.
