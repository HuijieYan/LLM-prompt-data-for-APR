## Analyzing the buggy function and the failing test

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the `_engine` function in the file `pandas/core/indexes/period.py`.

### Bug Description:
The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, but instead of passing the reference in the next line, it is passing `self` itself. This causes the weak reference to `self` not being used as intended, leading to potential issues related to reference counting and object deletion.

### Test Failure:
The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is related to the weak reference issue mentioned in the GitHub issue. It creates a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` and then checks if the created `MultiIndex` levels are monotonic. Due to the incorrect passing of `self` instead of the weak reference in the `_engine` function, the test fails to maintain weak references, resulting in the failure of the test.

### GitHub Issue:
The GitHub issue titled "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs" highlights the problem of weak references being dropped prematurely when copying `PeriodIndex` levels in a `MultiIndex`. The issue description confirms the bug's presence and expectation for the correct output.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should correctly use the weak reference obtained from `weakref.ref(self)` when creating the `_engine_type`. This will ensure that the weak reference is used as intended, maintaining the reference to `self` without interfering with the object's lifecycle.

## Corrected version of the function

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

By adjusting the function to use `period_ref` as a weak reference instead of directly using `self`, we can fix the bug and ensure that the weak reference is correctly maintained throughout the function's execution.

With this corrected version, the `_engine` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub regarding the premature dropping of weak references.
