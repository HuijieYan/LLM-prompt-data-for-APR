## Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, but the bug lies in the fact that it is not properly handling the weak reference during the function call to `_engine_type`, leading to a reference cycle issue.

## Error Location:
The error lies in how the weak reference `period` is passed to `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.

## Cause of the Bug:
1. The weak reference `period` is created but not properly handled during the `_engine_type` function call, leading to the weak reference being dropped prematurely.
2. This causes the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`, resulting in unexpected behavior.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the weak reference `period` is properly utilized within the `_engine` function to prevent premature dropping.
2. Make sure to handle the weak reference correctly when passing it as an argument to `_engine_type` to maintain the reference throughout the function call.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    weak_period = period()
    return self._engine_type(weak_period, len(self))
```

By using `weak_period = period()` to retrieve the weakly referenced object and passing `weak_period` to `_engine_type`, the corrected version ensures that the weak reference remains valid during the function call. This modification should resolve the reference cycle issue and allow the function to work as intended, passing the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` correctly.
