## Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is supposed to return an engine type for a PeriodIndex object. However, the use of `weakref.ref(self)` to create the weak reference to `self` is causing the loss of the reference, resulting in `None` being passed to `_engine_type`.

## Error Locations:
The issue lies in the way the weak reference is created using `weakref.ref(self)`. This causes the weakly referenced PeriodIndex object to be dropped prematurely.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug causes the `PeriodIndex` weak reference to be lost before intended, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained until its intended usage is complete. One approach is to store the result of `weakref.ref(self)` in a variable within the `_engine` function. Then, pass this variable to `_engine_type`.

## The Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference to self in a variable
    weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weak_period, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference in a variable within the `_engine` function, we ensure that the reference is maintained until it is passed to the `_engine_type` function. This corrected version should prevent the premature loss of the reference and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
