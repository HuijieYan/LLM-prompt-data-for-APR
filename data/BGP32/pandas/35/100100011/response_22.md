## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using a weak reference to avoid a reference cycle, but it is not properly set up.
2. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` loses weak references, leading to a `None` value being passed to the `PeriodEngine`.
3. The failing test case shows that when checking `is_monotonic` for levels in a `MultiIndex`, an error is raised due to the weak reference issue.

## Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is that the weak reference `period` is not correctly set up in the `_engine` function, resulting in a `None` value being passed to `self._engine_type`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly established and passed to `_engine_type` to avoid losing weak references when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By modifying the `_engine` function to use `period()` instead of `period`, we can ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly obtained when passing it to `self._engine_type`.

This corrected version should resolve the weak reference issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the failing test case now passes successfully.
