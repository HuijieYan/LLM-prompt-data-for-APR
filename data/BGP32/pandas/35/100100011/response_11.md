## Analysis:
The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self` (an instance of the class), but the implementation is incorrect. When the `_engine` function is called, it should pass the weak reference to `self` to `_engine_type`. However, the weak reference is not being correctly used, leading to the issue reported on GitHub.

## Error Location:
The issue lies in how the `weakref.ref` object is used within the `_engine` function.

## Cause of the Bug:
The `weakref.ref` object is not being dereferenced correctly before being passed to `_engine_type`. This results in passing a weak reference object instead of the actual `self` reference, causing unexpected behavior.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to properly dereference the weak reference obtained from `weakref.ref` before passing it to `_engine_type`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)()  # Dereference the weak reference
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By dereferencing the weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)()` right after obtaining it, we ensure that we pass the actual reference to `self` to `_engine_type`, fixing the issue reported in GitHub.
