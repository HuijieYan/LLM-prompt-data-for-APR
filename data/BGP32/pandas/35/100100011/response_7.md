Based on the provided information, the issue seems to be related to the weak referencing of PeriodIndex levels in a MultiIndex. The weak reference is not properly handled in the `_engine` function, leading to a None value being passed to the `PeriodEngine`.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the weak reference is correctly maintained throughout the `_engine` function. We can achieve this by using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to the `self` object.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By making this change, the weak reference to `self` will be maintained throughout the function, and the correct `PeriodIndex` object will be passed to the `PeriodEngine`.

This correction should resolve the bug described in the GitHub issue and make the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` pass successfully.
