## Analysis:
- The `_engine` function is utilizing `weakref.ref`, which is used to create weak references to objects. In this case, the intention seems to prevent a reference cycle in `_engine_type`.
- The failing test involves creating a `MultiIndex` with `Period` objects and then getting the level values, which in turn checks if the values are monotonic. This test is failing due to weak reference handling issues in the `_engine` function.

## Error Cause:
- The bug is occurring because the `period` variable in the `_engine` function is not being utilized correctly. It is supposed to store a weak reference to the `self` object, but it is not being used when instantiating the `_engine_type`.
- This causes the `_engine_type` to receive None instead of the expected PeriodIndex object, resulting in the failure of the subsequent test.

## Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, the weak reference obtained from `self` needs to be passed correctly to the `_engine_type` instantiation. This way, the `_engine_type` function receives the actual object it expects.
- Ensure that the weak reference does not get lost or converted to None during the process, maintaining the reference correctly.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Storing weak reference correctly
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Passing weak reference correctly to _engine_type instantiation
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By utilizing `period()` instead of simply `period`, we are converting the weak reference to the actual object before passing it to `_engine_type`. This ensures that the `_engine_type` receives the intended object and resolves the weak reference issues. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue related to weak reference handling in PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex.
