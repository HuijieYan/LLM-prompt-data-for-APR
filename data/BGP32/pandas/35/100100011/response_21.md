The buggy function `_engine` is causing an issue due to the weak reference not being properly maintained. When an attempt is made to access the weakly referenced PeriodIndex in the failing test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods`, it results in a `None` value being passed to the PeriodEngine, leading to the failure of the test.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly maintained so that it remains accessible when needed. We can achieve this by modifying the `_engine` function to store the weak reference `period` in a separate variable and then dereferencing it when required.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    period_ref = period()  # Dereference the weak reference
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

By modifying the function in this way, we ensure that the weak reference remains valid and is properly dereferenced when needed, resolving the issue raised in the GitHub report. This corrected version should now pass the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods`.
