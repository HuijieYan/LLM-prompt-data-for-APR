## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` which is the PeriodIndex object.
2. The function then calls `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` where `self._engine_type` is expected to use the weak reference.
3. The bug is likely in how the weak reference `period` is created and used, leading to `None` being passed to `_engine_type`.
   
## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by not maintaining the reference to the weak reference object `period`, leading to its premature deletion and resulting in `None` being passed to `_engine_type`.

## Strategy for Fixing
To fix the bug, we need to store the weak reference object `period` within the `_engine` method, ensuring that it remains alive until it is used in `_engine_type`.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    self._cached_period_weakref = period  # Store weak reference to keep it alive
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference `period` in `self._cached_period_weakref`, we ensure that the weak reference remains alive until it is used in `_engine_type`. This correction should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and make the failing test pass.
