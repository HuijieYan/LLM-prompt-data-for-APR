## Analysis
The `_engine` function in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file contains a potential bug. The use of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` is likely problematic. The bug is causing the `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` to lose weak references, leading to unexpected behavior in the test case `test_get_level_values_when_periods`.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is causing the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to be dropped prematurely before the `PeriodEngine` utilizes it, resulting in `None` being passed instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, it is crucial to ensure that the weak reference to `self` (PeriodIndex) is maintained correctly throughout the `_engine` function so that the `PeriodEngine` receives the valid reference. This can be accomplished by revising how the weak reference is created and ensuring its validity until it's used by the `PeriodEngine`.

## Corrected Function
Below is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use a lambda function to create a weak reference to self
    period = lambda: self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By utilizing a lambda function to create a weak reference to `self` within the `_engine` function, we can ensure that `self` remains valid until it's utilized by the `PeriodEngine`, thus resolving the bug identified in the failing test case. This correction should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the test case `test_get_level_values_when_periods` passes successfully.
