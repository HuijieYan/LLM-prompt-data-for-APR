## Analysis:
- The buggy function `_engine` uses `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference of the input `self`, which is an instance of a class.
- The function then calls `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` using the weak reference `period`. This is done to avoid a reference cycle.

## Identified Issue:
- The issue seems to be related to the way the weak reference is being used. In the given context, `period` is created as a weak reference to `self`, but it is not appropriately utilized when passing it to `self._engine_type`.
- Due to the incorrect handling of the weak reference, the `self._engine_type` call might receive `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex` object.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
- Ensure that the weak reference is correctly dereferenced to get the original object when passing it to `self._engine_type`.
- Check if the weak reference has been disposed of before usage, and handle it appropriately.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@Appender
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected code:
- The weak reference is created using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)` to ensure that it can still be accessed.
- By using `weakref.proxy`, the original object will be returned when the weak reference is provided to `_engine_type`.

With this correction, the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved, and the provided failing test should pass successfully.
