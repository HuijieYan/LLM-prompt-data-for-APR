## Analysis:
1. The `_engine` function in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file is decorated with `@cache_readonly`.
2. The function creates a weak reference to `self` and then attempts to return an instance of `_engine_type` with the weak reference and the length of `self`.
3. The failing test in `pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py` is related to `PeriodIndex` on `MultiIndex` losing weak references when copying levels.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the problem where the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead.
5. The test case provided aims to check if all levels in `idx2` are monotonic, but due to the weak reference issue, it fails.

## Bug Cause:
The bug arises because the weak reference to `self` is not being properly managed or retained within the `_engine` function. When `period = weakref.ref(self)` is called, the weak reference stored in `period` may become invalid or lose reference, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None`.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly maintained throughout the `_engine` function's execution.
2. Add error handling to check if the weak reference is still valid before using it to create an instance of `_engine_type`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    if period() is not None:  # Check if weak reference is valid
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        raise RuntimeError("Weak reference to self is no longer valid.")
```

By adding the check `if period() is not None`, we ensure that the weak reference is still valid before proceeding to create an instance of `_engine_type`. This fix addresses the issue of losing weak references in `PeriodIndex` on `MultiIndex` levels.
