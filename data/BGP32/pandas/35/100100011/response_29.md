## Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine()` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` (which is likely a `PeriodIndex` instance), but it is not being used correctly due to passing it incorrectly to `_engine_type`. This results in the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` getting dropped prematurely, causing the engine to receive `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref(self)` in the `_engine()` function, where the weakly referenced object is not effectively utilized, leading to premature dropping of the reference. This behavior can be observed in the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods()` where `idx2` does not have the expected `PeriodIndex` instance due to the weak reference issue.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained throughout the `_engine()` function correctly. One potential strategy is to modify how the weak reference is passed to `_engine_type` to preserve the reference until it is properly utilized within the engine.

## Corrected Function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_weakref(), len(self)) if period_weakref() is not None else None
```

In the corrected version of the `_engine()` function, we create the weak reference `period_weakref` correctly and pass it to `_engine_type` after checking that it is not `None`. This modification ensures that the weakly referenced `self` object is properly utilized within the engine function, resolving the premature dropping issue.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods()` and address the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
