The issue originates from the `_engine` function in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file. The function has a bug where it passes a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type` but incorrectly assigns it to `period` without preserving the reference. This leads to `period` being garbage collected prematurely, causing `_engine` to receive `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, we need to keep a strong reference to the weak reference value until it is used. One approach is to store the weak reference value in a variable that maintains a strong reference until it is used within `_engine`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, keep a strong reference to the weakref
    weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    period = weak_period()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By storing `weak_period`, we maintain a strong reference to the weak reference value until it is accessed through `period`, preventing premature garbage collection and ensuring that `_engine` receives the correct `PeriodIndex` object.

This correction should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and allow the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` to pass successfully.
