## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is a PeriodIndex object.
2. The issue reported on GitHub mentions that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex object is dropped earlier than intended, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving `None` instead of the PeriodIndex.
3. The failing test case is related to accessing levels of a MultiIndex created from a PeriodIndex, which might be impacted by the weak reference issue.
4. To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` remains valid until the `_engine_type` function uses it.

## Bug:
The bug in the current implementation is that the weakly referenced `period` is created locally within the `_engine` function, and it goes out of scope once the function returns. This premature drop of the weak reference leads to `None` being passed to `_engine_type`.

## Fix Strategy:
We need to store the weak reference to `self` in an instance variable or a class variable to ensure it remains valid during the `_engine` function's execution and when the `_engine_type` function is invoked. This will prevent the weak reference from becoming `None` prematurely.

## The corrected version of the function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store weakref reference to self in an instance variable
    self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference in `self._period_ref`, we maintain a reference to `self` as long as the object instance is valid, ensuring that the weak reference is not prematurely dropped.
