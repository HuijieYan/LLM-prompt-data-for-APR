### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`. The issue seems to be related to the weak reference not being maintained properly, resulting in `PeriodIndex` levels losing weakrefs.

### Identifying potential error locations:
1. Creating a weak reference to `self` using `weakref.ref(self)` might not be maintaining the reference properly.
2. The weak reference might be getting dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of `PeriodIndex`.

### Explanation of the bug:
The bug occurs when `weakref.ref(self)` fails to maintain the weak reference correctly, causing it to be dropped prematurely. This leads to the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of a valid `PeriodIndex`, resulting in unexpected behavior.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained properly throughout the `_engine` function. One approach could be to use a different method for creating and passing weak references to avoid premature dropping.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from pandas.util._decorators import Appender, cache_readonly, doc

# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weakref object for self
    weakself = weakref.ref(self)

    # Check if the weak reference is still alive before accessing it
    if weakself() is not None:
        return self._engine_type(weakself(), len(self))
    else:
        raise ValueError("Weak reference to self is no longer valid")
```

By adding a check to ensure that the weak reference is still alive before accessing it in the corrected version of the `_engine` function, we can prevent the premature dropping of the weak reference. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and make the function more robust.
