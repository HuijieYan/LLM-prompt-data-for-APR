To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `self` object is correctly passed to `_engine_type`. The issue mentioned on GitHub indicates that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped prematurely, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` object instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`. This is causing the test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` to fail.

To address this issue, we should modify the `_engine` function to maintain the weak reference throughout the call to `_engine_type`. Here's the corrected version:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In this corrected version, we invoke the weak reference `period` as a function by using `period()` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This ensures that the `PeriodIndex` object is correctly referenced during the call to `_engine_type`, preventing premature dropping of the weak reference.

By applying this fix, the test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` should now pass successfully without raising an error.
