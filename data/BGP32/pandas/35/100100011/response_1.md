## Fixing the Bug

### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is a `PeriodIndex` object. The weak reference is then passed to `_engine_type` constructor. However, this approach seems incorrect as it's not preserving the weak reference properly, resulting in `None` being passed to `_engine_type`.

### Error Locations:
1. The weak reference creation using `period = weakref.ref(self)` is not working as expected.
2. The weak reference `period` is not maintained correctly until it's passed to `_engine_type`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Maintain the weak reference correctly until passing it to `_engine_type`.
2. Ensure that the weak reference doesn't get lost or turn into `None`.

### Corrected Version of `_engine` Function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

### Updated Explanation:
The corrected version uses `weakref.proxy(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` without losing or converting it to `None`. This ensures that the weak reference is maintained properly until passed to `_engine_type`, resolving the bug.

With this correction, the `PeriodEngine` will receive the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` as intended, addressing the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
