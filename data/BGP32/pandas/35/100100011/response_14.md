## Analysis
The `_engine` function is utilizing a weak reference to the `self` object, which should prevent a reference cycle. However, the issue mentioned on GitHub highlights that weak references are being dropped prematurely, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

## Identified Error
The weak reference creation in the `_engine` function is not correctly implemented, leading to the premature dropping of the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex`.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug arises from the weak reference creation in the `_engine` function, which is not maintaining a strong reference to the `PeriodIndex` as intended.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To resolve the issue, the weak reference creation should be modified to ensure the `PeriodIndex` object persists until it is no longer needed by the `PeriodEngine`.

## Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self, lambda _: None)  # Maintain strong ref until 'None' passed to lambda
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, the `period` weak reference now specifies a lambda function as a second argument, which retains a strong reference to the `PeriodIndex` object until the lambda function is called with `None`. This modification ensures the `PeriodIndex` is not dropped prematurely.
