### Analyzing the buggy function and the failing test
- The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class attempts to create an instance of `_engine_type` using `weakref.ref(self)` as an argument. This is done to avoid a reference cycle.
- The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` and then attempts to check if the resulting levels are monotonic.
- The error message indicates an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, suggesting that the weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` in the `_engine` function is not functioning as expected.
- The expected values for the `self._values` and `self` parameters indicate a `PeriodArray` and a `PeriodIndex` object respectively with specific data and properties.

### Identifying potential error locations
- The issue seems to be related to how the weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` is being used in the `_engine` function.
- The error message implies that the weak reference might not be correctly resolving to the original `self` object when trying to access attributes.

### Explaining the cause of the bug
- The weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` is not being dereferenced properly or is being lost during the creation of the `_engine_type` instance, resulting in it being `None`.
- As a consequence, the `_engine` function returns an instance of `_engine_type` with a `None` weak reference, leading to the `AttributeError` when trying to access attributes.

### Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug
To address this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` correctly resolves to the original `self` object when passed to the `_engine_type` constructor. One way to do this is by explicitly dereferencing the weak reference before passing it as an argument. We can achieve this by calling `period()` which returns the original object, if it is still alive.

### Corrected version of the `_engine` function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    resolved_self = period()  # Dereference weak reference
    return self._engine_type(resolved_self, len(self))
```

With this update, the weak reference is properly dereferenced using `period()` before being passed to the `_engine_type` constructor, ensuring that the original `self` object is correctly provided for further operations.
