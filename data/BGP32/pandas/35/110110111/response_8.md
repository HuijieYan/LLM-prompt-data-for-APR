## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is attempting to create a weak reference of `self` and then pass it to `_engine_type` constructor.
2. The error message indicates that an AttributeError is raised due to a 'NoneType' object having no attribute 'view'.
3. The expected input values are the PeriodArray `self._values` and the PeriodIndex `self`.
4. The bug seems to stem from a weak reference issue where the weak reference is not properly handled, causing a 'NoneType' object to be passed.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is maintained correctly, so it's not prematurely gc'ed.

## Correction
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if self is not None else None
```

By adding a check to ensure that `self` is not `None` before creating the weak reference, we prevent the issue where a 'NoneType' object is passed inadvertently. This correction should address the weak reference problem and prevent the AttributeError.
