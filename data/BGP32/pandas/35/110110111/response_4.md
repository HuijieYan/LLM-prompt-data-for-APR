To fix the bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class, we need to ensure that the weak reference is properly maintained and utilized. The issue seems to stem from the weak reference not being resolved correctly when creating the `PeriodEngine`.

Below is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return PeriodEngine(period, len(self))
```

In this corrected version, we correctly create a weak reference to `self` and pass it to the `PeriodEngine` constructor. This should prevent the issue where the PeriodEngine receives `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

By making this correction, the failing test should now pass successfully, and the expected input/output values should be satisfied.
