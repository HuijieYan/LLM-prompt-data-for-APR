## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object, which is supposed to be passed to `_engine_type` constructor. However, the weak reference is not being properly handled, and as a result, it leads to an AttributeError when trying to access `view("i8")`.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is indirectly triggering this bug by constructing `MultiIndex` objects from a `PeriodIndex` object and then checking for monotonicity. The error occurs in the `idx2.levels` check during the `assert` statement in the test.

## Bug Explanation
The bug arises because the weak reference created with `weakref.ref(self)` is not preserved correctly, leading to the `period` variable holding a reference to `None` instead of the intended weak reference to `self`. When the `_engine` property is accessed later, it tries to use the weak reference, which results in the AttributeError because `PeriodEngine` ends up receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex` object.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is correctly preserved in the `_engine` property. One way to achieve this is by storing the weak reference result in an instance variable of the class, preventing it from being deallocated prematurely.

## Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Preserve a weak reference to self
    if not hasattr(self, "_period_weakref"):
        self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    
    period = self._period_weakref
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference in `self._period_weakref`, we prevent it from being garbage-collected, ensuring that the weak reference is valid when needed later. This correction should resolve the attribute error and help the failing test to pass.
