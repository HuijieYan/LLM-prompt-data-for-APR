To fix the bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly maintained for the lifetime of the `_engine` object.

### Error Location:
The bug is due to the weak reference `period` being assigned inside the `_engine` function without being stored or used further. As a result, the weak reference is lost immediately after being assigned.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` during the failing test because the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object is not retained by the `_engine`, leading to a `NoneType` value being passed to the `PeriodEngine` superclass, where it expects a valid reference.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to store the weak reference to `self` in an instance variable of the `PeriodIndex` class to prevent it from being garbage collected prematurely. This ensures that the weak reference remains valid for the lifetime of the `_engine` object.

### Corrected Version of `_engine` Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class:
```python
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    # Other class code...

    def __init__(self, data=None, copy=False, freq=None, year=None, month=None, quarter=None,
                 day=None, hour=None, minute=None, second=None, tz=None, dtype=None):
        # Initialize the PeriodIndex instance variables
        self._period_ref = None  # Instance variable to store the weak reference

        # Remaining constructor code...

    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, store a weakref to self in the instance variable
        self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference to `self` in the `self._period_ref` instance variable, we ensure that the reference remains valid, fixing the bug and allowing the failing test to pass.

This corrected version properly maintains the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object within the `_engine` function, resolving the issue of losing the reference prematurely.
