## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is causing an AttributeError because `self._engine_type` is returning `None` instead of an actual `PeriodEngine` object.
2. The error is occurring when accessing the `is_monotonic` attribute in the test function, which leads to the `self._engine.is_monotonic_increasing` call internally.
3. The expected output is for the `is_monotonic` check to pass and return True, but it is failing due to the `NoneType` error.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine_type` method returns a valid `PeriodEngine` object instead of `None`.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, we need to make sure that the `self._engine_type` call does not return `None`. We can achieve this by checking if the `_engine_type` call returns a valid object before creating the `PeriodEngine` instance.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    engine_type = self._engine_type
    if engine_type is not None:
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return engine_type(period, len(self))
    return None  # Handle the case when _engine_type is None
```

By adding a check for the `engine_type` before creating the `PeriodEngine` instance, we prevent the `NoneType` error. This fix should resolve the issue and ensure that the `_engine` function works correctly.
