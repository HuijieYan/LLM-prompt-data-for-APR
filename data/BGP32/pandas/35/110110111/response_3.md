## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is failing during the test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` due to an attribute error when trying to access the `view` attribute of a `NoneType` object.
2. The failing test creates a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` and then checks if the levels are monotonic.
3. The failing test is expecting all levels to be monotonic, but it fails due to the bug in the `_engine` function. The error message indicates an attribute error where a `NoneType` object does not have the `view` attribute.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `self._engine` attribute returns a correctly initialized `PeriodEngine` object instead of `None`.
5. Update the `_engine` function to correctly initialize the `PeriodEngine` with the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex`.

## Bug Fix:
```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    self._engine = lambda: engine  # Assign the engine to _engine attribute
    return engine
```

By explicitly assigning the created engine to the `_engine` attribute of the `PeriodIndex` instance, we ensure that it is not lost prematurely due to weak referencing, fixing the bug in the function.

This fix should resolve the attribute error and allow the failing test to pass correctly.
