## Analysis:
1. Buggy function `_engine` is a `@cache_readonly` cached property method in the `PeriodIndex` class.
2. The error occurs in the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` in the file `pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py`.
3. The failing test is checking for monotonicity of levels in the `MultiIndex` object created from a `PeriodIndex`. The error message trace indicates that the issue is related to the `PeriodEngine` accessed in the test.
4. The failing test loads `pandas`, creates a `MultiIndex` with a `PeriodIndex` as one of the levels, and then checks the monotonicity of the levels in the resulting `MultiIndex`.

## Issue:
The buggy function `_engine` is not correctly referencing the `self` object as a weak reference when creating the `PeriodEngine`. This results in a `NoneType` error when accessing the engine later on during the failing test.

## Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to properly store a weak reference to the `self` object when creating the `PeriodEngine` in the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class.

## Corrected Version:
```python
from pandas.util._decorators import cache_readonly

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use a weak reference to avoid reference cycle
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By implementing the corrected version above, it ensures that a weak reference to `self` is passed to the `_engine_type` constructor, resolving the issue of accessing `NoneType` in the engine.
