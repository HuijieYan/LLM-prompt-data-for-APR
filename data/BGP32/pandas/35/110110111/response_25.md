To fix the bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained properly. The current implementation is incorrect as it assigns a weak reference to a local variable `period`, which goes out of scope before returning the `_engine` object.

To fix this bug:
1. Assign the weak reference directly to an instance attribute to maintain its reference throughout the execution.
2. Retrieve the actual `self` object from the weak reference when needed.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Assign the weak reference to an instance attribute
    self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

With this corrected implementation, the weak reference to `self` will be maintained throughout the `PeriodIndex` object's lifecycle, ensuring that it is accessible when creating the `_engine` object.

This correction should address the issue described in the GitHub platform and satisfy the expected input/output values for the failing test case.
