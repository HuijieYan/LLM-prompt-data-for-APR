### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref` incorrectly, leading to a `None` object being passed to `_engine_type`.
2. The error occurs in the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` when checking for monotonicity.
3. The failing test indicates an `AttributeError` due to a `NoneType` object not having the attribute `view`.
4. The cause of the bug is that the weak reference to `self` in `_engine` is not correctly referencing the `PeriodIndex` object, causing the `_engine_type` to receive `None`.
5. To fix the issue, the weak reference creation must be adjusted to ensure the reference is maintained.
6. The corrected version of the function will ensure the weak reference to `self` remains valid.

### Correction:
```python
    def _engine(self):
        period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

By correcting the weak reference creation in the `_engine`, the reference to `self` will be maintained, resolving the issue of passing a `None` object to `_engine_type`.
