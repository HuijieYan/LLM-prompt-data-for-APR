The bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class is caused by the weak reference not being properly handled. As a result, the `PeriodEngine` receives a `NoneType` instead of the `PeriodIndex`, leading to the `AttributeError` when trying to access an attribute on `None`.

To fix this bug:
1. Proper handling of the weak reference is needed to ensure that the `PeriodIndex` instance is correctly passed to the `_engine_type`.
2. The `weakref.ref(self)` should be called with `()` to create a weak reference object correctly.
3. Adjust the return statement to correctly provide the weak reference object as an argument to `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

With this correction, the weak reference to `self` is properly created and passed to the engine type, ensuring that the `PeriodEngine` receives the necessary information to avoid the `AttributeError` and function as intended.
