## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. The issue arises as it is passing a `weakref.ref` object `period` instead of the original `self` object, causing a reference cycle problem leading to the error.

## Bug Explanation
- The failing test involves creating a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` and then checking if the values in the levels of the resulting `MultiIndex` are monotonic.
- The error occurs because the `PeriodEngine` class tries to access attributes of the `PeriodIndex`, but the weakref object `period` is causing a `NoneType` error when looking for the `view` attribute.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to remove the usage of `weakref.ref` in the `_engine` function and directly pass `self` to `_engine_type`.

## The corrected function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
``` 

By removing the `weakref.ref` and directly passing `self` to `_engine_type`, we resolve the reference cycle issue and ensure that the `PeriodIndex` object is correctly passed for further operations without encountering the `NoneType` error.
