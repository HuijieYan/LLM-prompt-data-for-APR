## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is currently returning an instance of `_engine_type` by passing a weak reference of `self` which is causing the issue.
2. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` due to a `NoneType` object not having the attribute `view`.
3. The failing test is checking for the monotonicity of the levels in `idx2`, which involves accessing the `_engine` attribute of the `PeriodIndex` class.
4. The bug seems to be related to weak referencing `self` causing the engine to receive `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`. The `_engine` method should be updated to handle the weak referencing correctly.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` in the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class is handled properly. Instead of using weak references directly, we can store a strong reference to `self` in an instance variable and utilize it when creating the engine instance.

## The corrected version of the function:
```python
    def __init__(self, data=None, copy=False, freq=None, year=None, ...
        self._self = self  # Strong reference to self
    
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        period = self._self  # Using the strong reference instead of weakref
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))

``` 

By storing a strong reference to `self` in the `__init__` method and using it in the `_engine` method, we can address the weak reference issue and ensure that the engine instance is created correctly with the `PeriodIndex` instance.
