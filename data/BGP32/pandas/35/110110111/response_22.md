## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` method defined within the `PeriodIndex` class. The purpose of this method is to create an instance of the `_engine_type` class using a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object (`self`) and the length of the `PeriodIndex`.

2. The error occurs when trying to access the attribute `view` on a `NoneType` object, which suggests that the `_engine` method is not returning the expected `_engine_type` instance correctly.

3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` tries to check whether the levels of the multi-index created from `PeriodIndex` instances are monotonic. The error arises during this check due to the incorrect functioning of the `_engine` method.

4. The GitHub issue points out the problem of weak references not being properly handled, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a `None` instead of the intended PeriodIndex.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `_engine` method not correctly creating and returning an instance of the `_engine_type` class. The weak reference of the `PeriodIndex` object (`self`) is not being maintained properly, leading to a `NoneType` object being returned instead of the expected `_engine_type` instance. This error propagates to the failing test, causing the assertion failure.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained throughout the `_engine` method's execution. This will allow the `_engine_type` instance to be created correctly and prevent the returning of a `NoneType` object. Ensuring proper handling of weak references is crucial for resolving this issue.

Let's provide a corrected version of the `_engine` method:

## Corrected Version
```python
# Corrected _engine method
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_instance = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine_instance
```

By maintaining the weak reference using `period = weakref.ref(self)` throughout the method and returning the created `engine_instance`, we ensure that the correct `_engine_type` instance is returned without encountering the `NoneType` error.

This correction should address the bug and allow the failing test to pass as expected.
