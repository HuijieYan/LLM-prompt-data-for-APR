## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is aiming to return an `_engine_type` instance with weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object.
2. The error occurs when trying to access an attribute of a `NoneType` object in the `_do_monotonic_check` method.
3. The failing test case involves creating a `MultiIndex` object from a `PeriodIndex`, accessing level values, and checking if they are monotonic. The issue arises due to weak references not being properly handled.
4. To fix the bug, the weak reference handling in `_engine` needs to be modified to ensure it maintains the reference to the `PeriodIndex` object.

## Bug Fix
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we create a proxied object that acts as a weak reference to the original `PeriodIndex` object. This change ensures that the weak reference is maintained, and the error related to accessing attributes of `NoneType` is resolved.
