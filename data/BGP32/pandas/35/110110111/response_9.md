### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is causing an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` during the failing test execution. This error occurs because the intended weak reference to `PeriodIndex` (`self`) is not being maintained correctly.
2. The expected input values are a `PeriodArray` for `self._values` and a `PeriodIndex` for `self`.
3. The `_engine` property in `PeriodIndex` is intended to create an instance of `PeriodEngine` with a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object. However, the weak reference is not being preserved properly, leading to a `NoneType` object being passed when trying to access the view.
4. To fix the bug, the weak reference to `self` (`PeriodIndex`) should be maintained correctly in the `_engine` property.

### Proposed Fix:
```python
import weakref

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@inherit_names(['strftime', 'to_timestamp', 'asfreq', 'start_time', 'end_time'] + PeriodArray._field_ops, PeriodArray, wrap=True)
@inherit_names(['is_leap_year', 'freq', '_format_native_types'], PeriodArray)
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    """
    Immutable ndarray holding ordinal values indicating regular periods in time.
    Index keys are boxed to Period objects which carries the metadata (eg, frequency information).
    """
    
    # Correcting the buggy function _engine
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))

```

By correcting the handling of the weak reference to `self` (`PeriodIndex` object) in the `_engine` property, the bug should be resolved, and the failing test should pass.
