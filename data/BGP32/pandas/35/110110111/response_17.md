## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is part of the `PeriodIndex` class.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` uses `MultiIndex` and `PeriodIndex` to construct indices and check for monotonicity.
3. The error occurs in the assertion `assert all(x.is_monotonic for x in idx2.levels)`, specifically when checking the monotonicity of the levels of the index.
4. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `PeriodEngine` trying to access an attribute of a `NoneType`.

## Error Cause
The buggy function `_engine` is returning the result of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. The issue is that `period` is created as a weak reference to `self`, but the weak reference is not being handled properly within the `_engine_type` or `PeriodEngine`. This leads to the `NoneType` error when trying to access an attribute.

## Strategy for Fixing
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly handled within the `_engine_type` and `PeriodEngine`. This can be achieved by modifying the way the weak reference is used and ensuring that it does not lead to a `NoneType` when accessing attributes.

## Correction
Below is the corrected version of the function `_engine`:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    weak_self = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(weak_self, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, we create a weak reference that behaves like the original object without the risk of returning `NoneType`. This change should resolve the issue identified in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
