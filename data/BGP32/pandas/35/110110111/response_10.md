To fix the bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly passed to the `_engine_type` constructor. The issue arises from the fact that the weak reference `period` is not being dereferenced before being passed to `_engine_type`, leading to a `NoneType` error.

To resolve this bug, we need to use the `period()` method on the weak reference object `period` before passing it as an argument to `_engine_type`.

Corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By calling the `period()` method on `weakref.ref(self)`, we retrieve the referenced object (`self`) from the weak reference. This should resolve the issue of passing a `NoneType` to `_engine_type`.

After applying this fix, the `test_get_level_values_when_periods` function should pass without any errors.
