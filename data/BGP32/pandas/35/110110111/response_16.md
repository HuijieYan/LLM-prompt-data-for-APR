## Analysis
1. The buggy function is located within the `PeriodIndex` class in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file. The function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to the `self` object (an instance of `PeriodIndex`) and then passing that weak reference to the `_engine_type` method.
   
2. The error message occurs when trying to access the `view` attribute of a `NoneType` object, resulting in an `AttributeError`.
   
3. The expected input values are a `PeriodArray` containing periods '2019Q1' and '2019Q2' for `self._values`, and a `PeriodIndex` object representing the index with those periods for `self`. The expected output should be an instance of the `_engine_type` class using the weak reference to `self`.
   
4. To fix the bug, make sure that the weak reference to `self` is properly maintained for the duration needed and that it correctly points to the `PeriodIndex` object.
   
5. Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
