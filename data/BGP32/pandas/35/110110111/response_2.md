## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is utilizing a weak reference to prevent a reference cycle. The `_engine_type` is called with the weak reference and the length of the `PeriodIndex`.
2. The error message indicates that an `AttributeError` is raised because a `NoneType` object does not have the `view` attribute.
3. The expected input values are a `PeriodArray` containing '2019Q1' and '2019Q2' and a `PeriodIndex` with those values.
4. The issue on GitHub highlights the problem of losing weakrefs when copying levels on a `MultiIndex`, leading to the `NoneType` error in `PeriodEngine`.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance is not correctly handled when passed to `_engine_type`. As a result, the `_do_monotonic_check` method fails when trying to access the `view` attribute of the weak reference.

## Solution Strategy
The solution involves ensuring that the weak reference is maintained properly throughout the `_engine` function and correctly passed to `_engine_type` without losing it.

## Corrected Function
```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, self._data)
```

By maintaining the weak reference `period` correctly and passing it along with `self._data` to `_engine_type`, the corrected function should prevent the `NoneType` error and handle the weak reference properly.
