## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object, which indicates that the object should not be kept alive solely by the weak reference.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` with a `PeriodIndex` containing `Period` objects.
3. The error occurs when trying to access `is_monotonic` of the `MultiIndex` levels, ultimately calling `_engine.is_monotonic_increasing`, resulting in an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.
   
## Bug Cause
1. The `_engine` function should return an instance of `PeriodEngine` with the weak reference to `self` passed as an argument. However, due to the weak reference implementation, the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object is dropped prematurely.
2. This premature drop leads to the `_engine` function receiving a `NoneType` object instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`, causing the subsequent error when accessing attributes on this `NoneType` object.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` remains valid until its usage within the `_engine` function. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference in a local variable inside the `_engine` function so that it is not prematurely dropped. Then, use this local variable to create the `PeriodEngine` instance.

## Corrected Version
```python
    def _engine(self):
        # Store weak reference of self in a local variable
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        # Create PeriodEngine instance using the local weak reference
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self), attrs=self._attributes)
```

With the above correction, the weak reference to `self` will be maintained throughout the `_engine` function's execution, ensuring that the correct `PeriodIndex` object is referenced when creating the `PeriodEngine` instance.
