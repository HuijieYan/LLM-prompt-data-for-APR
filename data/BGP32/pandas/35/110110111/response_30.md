## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is part of the `PeriodIndex` class. It is supposed to return an instance of the `_engine_type` class which is initialized with a weak reference of the `PeriodIndex` instance.
2. The `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` suggests that the weak reference `period` used to initialize `_engine_type` is not valid or has been lost before initialization.
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `PeriodIndex` from two `Period` objects, creates a `MultiIndex` from the `PeriodIndex`, and then checks if the levels of the `MultiIndex` are monotonic. This fails due to the incorrect representation of `PeriodIndex`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` remains valid until it is used to initialize the `_engine_type`.
5. The corrected version of the function should handle the weak reference properly and ensure it remains valid.

## Bug Fix
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version:
- `period()` is used to dereference the weak reference at the time of initialization of `_engine_type`.
- This ensures that the weak reference remains valid and can be used to construct the `PeriodIndex` correctly.

By making this change, the corrected function should now correctly construct the `PeriodIndex` instance and resolve the issue in the failing test.
