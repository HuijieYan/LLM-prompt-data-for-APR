The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class appears to be causing issues when trying to access the `PeriodEngine` due to a weak reference problem. The error message suggests that a `NoneType` object is being encountered where `view("i8")` is expected.

The bug seems to be related to the weak reference handling in the `_engine` function. The weak reference `period` is being instantiated with the `self` object, but there might be an issue with how the weak reference's value is accessed later on.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is accessed properly and that it doesn't get lost before it's intended. One way to address this issue is by directly accessing the weak reference object `period` to obtain the actual reference when needed.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        period_obj = period()  # Get the actual reference from the weakref
        return self._engine_type(period_obj, len(self))
```

By directly accessing `period()` (the actual reference) from the weak reference, we ensure that the correct object reference is used when creating the `PeriodEngine`.

This correction should resolve the weak reference issue and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
