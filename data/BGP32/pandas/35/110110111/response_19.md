## Analyzing the buggy function and the failing test

- The buggy function `_engine` is defined within the `PeriodIndex` class. It uses a `cache_readonly` decorator.
- The function creates a weak reference to `self` as `period`, then attempts to initialize an object of `_engine_type` with the weak reference `period` and the length of `self`.

The failing test attempts to create a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` and expects all level values to be monotonic. However, the test fails due to an `AttributeError` raised in the internal pandas code, specifically in the `_do_monotonic_check` method, because of a `NoneType` issue when trying to access the `view` attribute.

## Identifying potential error locations
1. The weak reference `period` initialization might lead to unexpected behavior.
2. The creation of the `_engine` object with the weak reference could be causing the `NoneType` issue.

## Cause of the bug
The bug arises from dropping the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` before the intended time, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `NoneType` instead of the actual `PeriodIndex`.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
1. Ensure that the weak reference is maintained throughout the function or that the weak reference usage is redundant.
2. Verify that the `_engine_type` initialization does not encounter issues with weak references.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type did not return a valid engine object")
    return engine
``` 

By explicitly checking if `engine` is `None` and raising a `ValueError` if it is, we ensure that the `_engine` function returns a valid object that doesn't lead to the `NoneType` issue encountered during the failing test.
