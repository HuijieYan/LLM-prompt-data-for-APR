## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is attempting to create a weak reference to itself and then pass it to the `_engine_type` constructor. The purpose is to avoid a reference cycle.

2. However, the bug seems to be related to how the weak reference is used or handled, as it results in an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` when trying to access the `view` attribute.

3. The failing test case involves creating a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex`, extracting level values, and checking if they are monotonic. This leads to errors due to the weak reference handling issue.

4. To fix the bug, the issue with creating and handling the weak reference in the `_engine` function needs to be addressed.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference stored in the `period` variable holds a reference to the `self` object correctly. It seems that the `weakref.ref` might not be creating the weak reference as expected.

We should modify the `_engine` function to directly pass `self` to `_engine_type` constructor to ensure correct reference handling.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By passing `self` directly to the constructor, we ensure that the weakly-referenced `self` object remains valid throughout the `_engine` function's lifecycle.

This fix should address the weak reference handling issue and resolve the `AttributeError` when trying to access attributes of the weakly-referenced object.
