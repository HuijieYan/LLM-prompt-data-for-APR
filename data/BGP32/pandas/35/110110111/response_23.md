To fix the bug in the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly passed to the `_engine_type` constructor to prevent the reference cycle issue. The current implementation is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, but it seems that the weak reference is not being handled properly.

In order to correct this issue, we need to modify the `_engine` method to properly handle the weak reference. Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` method:

```python
# corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Pass the weak reference to the _engine_type constructor
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self) if period() is not None else 0)
```

In the corrected version, we first create a weak reference `period` to `self`, and then we pass this weak reference to the `_engine_type` constructor. This modification ensures that the reference to `self` is correctly handled and avoids the reference cycle issue.

By implementing this correction, the `_engine` method should now work as intended and address the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report.
