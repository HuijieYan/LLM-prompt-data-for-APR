## Analysis
1. The buggy function is `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file. It is used to return an engine type based on the length of the `PeriodIndex`.
   
2. The error occurs in the `test_get_level_values_when_periods` function in the `pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py` file. The error message indicates an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.
   
3. The expected input values for the failing test include a `PeriodIndex` object with two periods: `2019Q1` and `2019Q2`. The expected `PeriodArray` contains these two periods. The cause of the error is that the weak reference to `self` (`PeriodIndex`) is lost before it reaches the `PeriodEngine`, resulting in a `NoneType` error.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained throughout the process and correctly passed to the `PeriodEngine`.

## Bug Fix:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))

# Corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```

By directly passing `weakref.ref(self)` to `_engine_type`, we maintain the weak reference to `self` which should resolve the `NoneType` error in the `PeriodEngine`.

This fix ensures that the weak reference to `self` is preserved until it reaches the `_engine_type`, preventing the issue of losing the reference along the way.
