### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class returns an instance of `_engine_type` with a weak reference to `self` as an argument.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` tries to assert that all levels of a `MultiIndex` created from a `PeriodIndex` are monotonic.
3. The failure occurs at `return super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter().view("i8")` indicating that the `self` object in `PeriodEngine` is `None`, causing an `AttributeError`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` in the `_engine` function. When the `_engine` function is called later, the weakly referenced `self` has been garbage collected, leading to `None` being passed to `_engine_type`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, avoid using weak references in this context. Use a direct reference to `self` in the `_engine` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected _engine function without using weak reference
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
