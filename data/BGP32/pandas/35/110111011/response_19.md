### Correction of the Buggy Function

The issue in the buggy function `_engine` is directly related to weak references and the handling of the `period` variable. The weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` was being dropped prematurely, leading to a `NoneType` object in certain cases.

To fix this issue, we should ensure that the weak reference does not get dropped before its usage by `PeriodEngine`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference `period` to `self` will be maintained appropriately until it is used by `_engine_type`, ensuring that the reference does not become `NoneType`.
