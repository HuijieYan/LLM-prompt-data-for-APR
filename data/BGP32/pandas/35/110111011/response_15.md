### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class is caused by the weak reference to `self` not being maintained correctly, leading to a `NoneType` error when accessing attributes. This results in a loss of reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance, causing the subsequent error in the failing test.

### Bug Explanation:
The `_engine` function attempts to create a weak reference to `self`, the `PeriodIndex` instance, to avoid potential reference cycles. However, the reference is not stored properly, and when accessed later, it results in a `NoneType` error due to the weak reference becoming invalid.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, the weak reference should be correctly stored and maintained throughout the function's lifecycle. Ensuring proper handling of the weak reference will prevent it from becoming invalid, resolving the `NoneType` error.

### Corrected Version:
Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(lambda: period(), len(self))
```

In this corrected version:
- The weak reference to `self` is wrapped in a lambda function to maintain its validity.
- The lambda function is used to retrieve the reference to `self` when needed within the `_engine_type` call.

By ensuring the weak reference is correctly handled and accessed through the lambda function, the bug causing the `NoneType` error should be resolved.
