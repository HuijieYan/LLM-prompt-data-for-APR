## Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` related to a `NoneType` object not having an attribute `view`, which suggests that a variable is not being assigned properly.

Looking at the runtime values, the `self` variable is correctly passed as a `PeriodIndex` object with the values `PeriodIndex(['2019Q1', '2019Q2'], dtype='period[Q-DEC]', freq='Q-DEC')`. This information aligns with the context provided by the failing test and the GitHub issue.

## Bug Cause
The bug is likely due to the weak reference of `self` not being handled correctly within the `_engine` function. This issue results in the `period` variable not correctly capturing the reference to `self`, leading to the subsequent error when trying to create the `PeriodEngine`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly assigned and used within the `_engine` function. By properly setting up the weak reference, we can avoid the reference cycle issue and provide the required reference to create the `PeriodEngine` without encountering a `NoneType` error.

## Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function with the bug fixed:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In this corrected version, `period()` is used to retrieve the actual value from the weak reference, which should resolve the issue related to the `NoneType` error.

With this fix, the `PeriodIndex` class should now correctly create the `PeriodEngine` without encountering the attribute error during execution.
