### Explanation
The error occurs because the `_engine` function is trying to return `self._engine_type` with `period` passed as a weak reference to `self`. However, the issue is that `weakref.ref(self)` creates a weak reference to `self`, but the weak reference itself is not being accessed properly, resulting in passing `weakref.ref` itself rather than the referenced object.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to access the referenced object through the weak reference, which can be done by calling the `period` weak reference like a function to retrieve the actual object being referenced.

### The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

This corrected version should address the issue by correctly accessing the object from the weak reference before passing it to the `_engine_type` function.
