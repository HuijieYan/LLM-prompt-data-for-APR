To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained throughout the `_engine` function. The current implementation is losing the reference, leading to a `NoneType` error later in the code.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    # Check if the weakref is still valid before accessing it
    if period() is None:
        raise RuntimeError("Weak reference to PeriodIndex object is lost")
    
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By explicitly checking if the weak reference is still valid before accessing it, we can prevent the `NoneType` error that was occurring due to the lost reference.

This correction ensures that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained correctly and accessed safely within the function. This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread and allow the failing test to pass without errors.
