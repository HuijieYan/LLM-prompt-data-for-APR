### Identified issues:
1. The `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref` incorrectly, potentially leading to the creation of a weak reference.
2. The incorrect handling of weak references causes the `_engine` function to return `None`, leading to an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to incorrectly managing a weak reference in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The weak reference is handled improperly, which results in returning `None` instead of the expected value in the `idx2.levels` in the failing test. This ultimately leads to the `AttributeError` when trying to access attributes on the returned `None` object.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the weak reference created using `weakref.ref` remains valid and correctly points to the referenced object.
2. Modify the `_engine` function to handle the weak reference properly and resolve the issue with returning `None`.

### Corrected Version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use a strong reference instead of a weak reference
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By modifying the `_engine` function to use a strong reference instead of a weak reference, the correct `PeriodIndex` object will be passed to `_engine_type`, preventing the issue of returning `None` and resolving the `AttributeError`.
