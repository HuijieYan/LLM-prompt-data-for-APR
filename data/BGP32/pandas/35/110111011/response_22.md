### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` method within the `PeriodIndex` class, responsible for creating an instance of a specific `PeriodEngine` type. However, the function seems to have an issue where it incorrectly assigns a weak reference of `self` to a variable named `period` but then returns the instance without properly handling the weak reference.

2. The error occurs in the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` due to the incorrect handling of weak references in the `_engine` method, leading to the `PeriodEngine` getting a `NoneType` instead of a `PeriodIndex`, causing an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_engine` method is caused by incorrect handling of weak references. When a weak reference is created to `self`, it should be properly dereferenced using the `()` operator or accessing it through the `weakref` module. However, the code returns the weak reference itself instead of the actual referenced object.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `_engine` method should correctly dereference the weak reference `period` to retrieve the actual `self` object before returning it to ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives the expected `PeriodIndex` instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

By dereferencing the weak reference `period` using `()` to obtain the actual `self` object, the corrected version ensures that the `PeriodEngine` receives the valid `PeriodIndex` instance, resolving the `AttributeError` in the failing test.
