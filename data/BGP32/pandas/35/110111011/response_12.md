## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is attempting to create an instance of the `_engine_type` class with a weak reference to the `self` object. However, there seems to be an issue where the weak reference to `self` is being accessed incorrectly, leading to a `NoneType` error during the test execution.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is creating a `MultiIndex` with a `PeriodIndex` containing two periods. It then attempts to create another `MultiIndex` by extracting the level values from the original `MultiIndex` and checking if they are monotonic. The check for monotonicity accesses the underlying `is_monotonic` property which ultimately relies on the `_engine` attribute, triggering the error.

The error occurs when the `self._engine` attribute in the `PeriodIndex` class is accessed, which leads to an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.

## Bug Cause
The bug arises due to how the weak reference to `self` is handled within the `_engine` function. It seems that the weak reference is not being properly resolved when the `_engine_type` is being initialized, causing the reference to become `None` and leading to subsequent attribute errors when trying to access properties of the `PeriodEngine`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the weak reference to `self` should be maintained throughout the `_engine` function to ensure that it remains valid when creating the `_engine_type` instance. This involves ensuring that the weak reference is resolved correctly before using it to initialize the `_engine_type`.

## Updated Buggy Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    self_ref = period()
    if self_ref is not None:
        return self._engine_type(self_ref, len(self))
    else:
        raise RuntimeError("Weak reference to self is no longer available.")
```

This fix ensures that the weak reference to `self` (`period`) is correctly resolved before calling the `_engine_type`, preventing the AttributeError related to a `NoneType` object.

By making the above adjustment to the `_engine` function, the issue identified in the failing test should be resolved, and the test should pass successfully.
