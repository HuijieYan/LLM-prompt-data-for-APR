## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine(self)` in the `PeriodIndex` class returns an instance of `_engine_type` by passing a weak reference of `self` to it.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` with a `PeriodIndex`, and when checking if the levels are monotonic, it accesses the engine attribute, which triggers the bug.
3. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` stating that a `NoneType` object has no attribute 'view', which suggests that the `_get_index_values()` method in `_engine_type` is returning `None`.
4. The bug seems to be caused by improper handling of weak references in the `_engine` function, resulting in the engine being initialized as `None`.

## Correction Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is properly handled when creating the engine instance. It's likely that the weak reference is not being properly dereferenced or that the weak reference is being lost prematurely.

## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# corrected _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    period = period_ref()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this modification, the corrected function should properly hold the weak reference to `self` and ensure that it is available when creating the `_engine_type` instance, resolving the `NoneType` attribute error.
