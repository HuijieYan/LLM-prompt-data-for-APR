To fix the bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is handled correctly and that it is not lost prematurely. The current implementation seems to be losing the weak reference before it is used, leading to the AttributeError when trying to access attributes of a None object.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    class PeriodEngine(IndexEngine):
        def _do_monotonic_check(self):
            values = self._get_index_values()
            return super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter(values).view('i8')
    
    return PeriodEngine(period, len(self))
```

In this corrected version, the weak reference `period` is maintained within the `PeriodEngine` class, ensuring that it is available when needed to access the attributes of the `self` object. This should prevent the AttributeError that was occurring previously.

By making this change, the corrected function should now operate correctly and pass the failing test case provided.
