## Analysis
The `PeriodIndex` class contains a `_engine` function decorated with `@cache_readonly` that returns an instance of the `_engine_type` class, passing a weak reference of `self` to avoid reference cycles. However, the error occurs in the `PeriodEngine` class when trying to access an attribute of a `NoneType` object, leading to an `AttributeError`. This error prevents proper functionality and leads to failing tests.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by premature dropping of the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex`, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` object instead of a valid `PeriodIndex` object. This occurs because the weak reference used in the `_engine` function doesn't get properly stored or maintained, leading to an incorrect reference when accessed later in the code.

## Fix Strategy
To resolve the bug, ensure that the weak reference is properly maintained throughout the lifecycle of the `PeriodIndex` instance. This involves storing the weak reference to prevent it from being garbage collected prematurely and ensuring that it remains valid when accessed by the `PeriodEngine`.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference to prevent premature garbage collection
    self._weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._weak_period, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference in a class attribute (`_weak_period`), we ensure that it remains valid until it is appropriately accessed in the `PeriodEngine`. This fix should prevent the `NoneType` attribute error and resolve the failing test case.
