## Bug Explanation

The bug occurs in the `_engine` function defined within the `PeriodIndex` class. The error message indicates that an AttributeError is raised due to a 'NoneType' object not having the 'view' attribute. This implies that the `_do_monotonic_check` method is returning a 'NoneType' object instead of the expected index values.

Looking at the function implementation:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

The issue lies with how the weak reference `period` is being handled. When assigning `period = weakref.ref(self)`, the reference to `self` is being held weakly, but the value itself is not retained strongly. This results in `None` being passed to `_engine_type` when it tries to access the values.

## Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is correctly retrieved and used in the `_engine` function. We can achieve this by modifying the function to first extract the strong reference to `self` from the weak reference `period` before using it. This way, we ensure that the actual objects are retained and prevent the `NoneType` issue.

## The corrected function

```python
# Fix the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    period = period_ref()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By updating the `_engine` function to extract the strong reference `period` from the weak reference `period_ref`, we ensure that the object is correctly passed to `_engine_type` without causing the 'NoneType' issue.
