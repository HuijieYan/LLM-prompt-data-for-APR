### Fixing the Bug

#### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is returning a weak reference `ref` to `self` and passing it to `_engine_type` constructor. The issue arises as the weak reference is not being correctly handled or retained.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` and tries to access the `is_monotonic` property, leading to an error due to `NoneType` object.
3. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` with `NoneType` object having no attribute 'view', which suggests an issue with accessing an incorrect object of type `None`.

#### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not properly maintaining the weak reference of `self` in the `_engine` function, leading to it resolving to `NoneType` within `_engine_type`.

#### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is correctly preserved and used within the `_engine` function by checking for its validity before accessing it. We should handle weak references properly to avoid any `NoneType` related errors.

#### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    if period() is not None:
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By making this change, we ensure that `period` is checked for validity before use, preventing the error caused by accessing a non-existent object.

This corrected code should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and pass the failing test successfully.
