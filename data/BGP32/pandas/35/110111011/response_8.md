## Analyzing the buggy function and the failing test

The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is meant to create an instance of the `PeriodEngine` class using a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object to prevent reference cycles. However, the function is not properly creating the engine instance, leading to an AttributeError when trying to access the view property of the engine.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is checking for monotonicity in a MultiIndex created from a PeriodIndex. This test fails due to the incorrect behavior of the `_engine` function.

### Error Location
The error lies in the `_engine` function where the weak reference is not being handled correctly, resulting in the PeriodEngine instance being created with a NoneType object.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object not being properly used in the `_engine` function. This leads to the PeriodEngine instance receiving a NoneType object instead of the expected `PeriodIndex` object, causing an AttributeError when trying to access properties of the NoneType object.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is properly handled in the `_engine` function so that the PeriodEngine instance is created correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is not None:
        return engine
    else:
        raise ValueError("Failed to create PeriodEngine instance.")
```

By checking if the engine instance is not None before returning it, we can ensure that the engine is created properly with the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object.

This correction should address the issue described in the failing test and resolve the AttributeError encountered during the test execution.
