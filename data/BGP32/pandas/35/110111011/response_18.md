## Analysis:
- The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is supposed to return an instance of the `PeriodEngine` using a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object.
- Based on the provided error message and test, it seems that the weak reference is not being maintained correctly, leading to an attribute error when trying to access the `view` attribute on a `NoneType`.
- The failing test involves creating a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` and then checking if the levels are monotonic.

## Bug Cause:
- The `_engine` function is not correctly handling the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object, which results in the attribute error when trying to access the `view` attribute on a `NoneType`.
- This behavior causes the weak reference to become `None` and results in the attribute error during the check for monotonicity.

## Fix Strategy:
- Ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is correctly maintained within the `_engine` function to prevent it from becoming `None`.
- The weak reference should be handled appropriately to avoid the attribute error when accessing attributes of the `PeriodEngine`.

## Correction:

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained correctly, ensuring that the `PeriodEngine` instance is created without any attribute errors. This should resolve the issue raised in the failing test.
