The bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class is causing the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` to produce an `AttributeError`. The issue stems from the fact that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object is dropped prematurely, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `NoneType` instead of the `PeriodIndex` object. This results in the `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is maintained throughout the `_engine` function's execution.

Let's correct the buggy function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(lambda: period(), len(self))
```

With this correction, we are capturing the weak reference to `self`, and when invoking `period()`, we retrieve the referenced object, ensuring that it is still available for use by the `PeriodEngine`.

This fix should address the issue and make the failing test pass successfully.
