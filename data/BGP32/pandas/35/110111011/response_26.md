### Bug Analysis:
1. The `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error occurs when trying to access the `view` attribute on a `NoneType` object in the `is_monotonic_increasing` method.
2. The `_engine` function returns an instance of `_engine_type` initialized with a weak reference to `self`. However, the weak reference handling might lead to the weak ref being `None` at a later point during execution, causing the AttributeError.
3. The GitHub issue mentions weakrefs being dropped prematurely, which aligns with the weakref handling in the `_engine` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the weak reference issue, ensure that a valid weak reference to `self` is maintained throughout the function execution. One way to achieve this is by storing the weak reference in a local variable before using it in the initialization of `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    weak_period = period()  # Retrieve the weak reference
    return self._engine_type(weak_period, len(self))
```

By storing the result of `period()` in `weak_period`, we ensure that the weak reference remains valid during the initialization of `_engine_type`.

This modification should fix the weak reference handling issue, preventing the AttributeError related to a `NoneType` object in subsequent operations.
