## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is causing the test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` to fail.
2. The error message indicates an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.
3. The function `is_monotonic` in `pandas/core/indexes/base.py` tries to access `self._engine.is_monotonic_increasing`, which eventually leads to the error due to a None value.
4. The bug seems to be related to weak reference handling in the `_engine` function, where `period` is a weak reference, and it's not being utilized correctly.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is utilized properly to avoid the NoneType error.

## Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine_type is not None:
        return engine_type
    else:
        return super(PeriodIndex, self)._engine
    
```

By checking if the `engine_type` is not None, we ensure that the weak reference `period` is correctly utilized to avoid the AttributeError. This fix should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
