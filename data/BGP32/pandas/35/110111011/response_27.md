## Bug Analysis
- The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is attempting to create a weak reference to itself but is not handling it correctly.
- The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` and then checks if all levels are monotonic. This involves checking the `is_monotonic` property of the levels, which internally calls `_engine.is_monotonic_increasing`.
- The error message indicates that there is an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` when trying to access the view of the index values.

## Bug Explanation
- The buggy function `_engine` is supposed to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance but is incorrectly returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.
- The weak reference is not handled properly, leading to issues when accessing engine properties later on, resulting in a `NoneType` object being accessed.

## Bug Fix Strategy
- Correctly handle the weak reference creation in the `_engine` function.
- Ensure that the weak reference is maintained properly throughout the class's lifetime to prevent premature cleanup.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
