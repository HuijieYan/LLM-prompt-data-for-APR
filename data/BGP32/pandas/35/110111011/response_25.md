## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using a weak reference to `self` but not handling it properly. As a result, it leads to an `AttributeError` when trying to access the weakly referenced object. The failing test is trying to check if all levels of a `MultiIndex` are monotonic, which relies on the correct behavior of `PeriodIndex._engine`. The issue on GitHub highlights that the weak referencing is not working as expected, causing the `NoneType` error.

## Bug Cause
The bug arises from the weak reference created in the `_engine` function. When the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object is accessed, it returns as `None`, leading to the `AttributeError` when further operations are performed on it. This behavior is different from the expected behavior where the weak reference should point to a valid `PeriodIndex` object.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the weak reference should be handled correctly in the `_engine` function. We need to ensure that when accessing the weak reference to `self`, it returns a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex` object instead of `None`. This can be achieved by modifying how the weak reference is maintained within the function.

## Updated Corrected Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    period_index = period()
    if period_index is None:
        raise RuntimeError("Unable to maintain weak reference to PeriodIndex")
    return self._engine_type(period_index, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, once the weak reference to `self` is obtained, it is immediately converted to a strong reference `period_index`. If the `period_index` is `None`, an exception is raised, indicating the failure to maintain the weak reference. This approach ensures that a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is passed to the `_engine_type` constructor, resolving the issue with the weak reference and preventing the `AttributeError` during subsequent operations.
