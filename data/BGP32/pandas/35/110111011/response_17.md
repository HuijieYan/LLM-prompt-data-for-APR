## Bug Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` returns the result of instantiating an `_engine_type` object. However, it passes a weak reference of `self` to the `_engine_type` constructor.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `PeriodIndex` object and attempts to access monotonicity properties, leading to an error related to a `NoneType` object being accessed.
3. The error occurs because the weak reference to `self` is not maintained correctly, resulting in the `_engine_type` receiving `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that a strong reference to `self` is passed to the `_engine_type` constructor.
5. The corrected version of the `_engine` function will create a strong reference to `self` when passing it to the `_engine_type`.

## Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
``` 

By directly passing `self` (strong reference) instead of using a weak reference, the corrected version prevents the error related to the `NoneType` object and ensures that the `_engine_type` receives the valid `PeriodIndex` object. This fix resolves the issue reported in GitHub and allows the failing test to pass.
