To fix the bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly passed to `_engine_type`. The error message suggests that a `NoneType` object is causing an attribute error, indicating that the weak reference might not be working as intended.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```

In the fix provided above, we explicitly pass a weak reference to `self` when calling `_engine_type`. This ensures that the weak reference remains valid during the execution of the `_engine` function and avoids the attribute error caused by a `NoneType` object during the runtime.

By making this change, the `PeriodIndex` class should now correctly maintain the weak reference to `self` when creating the engine object, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
