## Identified Bug

The bug occurs in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class, where a weak reference to `self` is passed to `_engine_type`, but due to implementation issues, `period` is not being stored correctly, resulting in an `AttributeError` when trying to access `view("i8")`.

## Bug Explanation

The root cause of the bug lies in how the weak reference is handled. The `period` variable is intended to store a weak reference to `self`, but due to incorrect implementation, the weak reference is not being properly stored. This leads to the `PeriodEngine` instance receiving a None object instead of the intended weak reference.

When trying to access `view("i8") on a None object, an `AttributeError` is raised since None does not have the `view` method, resulting in the failing test.

## Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` correctly stores a reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This will prevent the AttributeError from occurring when trying to access attributes of the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex`.

## Corrected Version

```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By correctly storing a weak reference to `self` in the `period` variable, the corrected version of the function ensures that the intended reference is passed to `_engine_type`, resolving the AttributeError and allowing the function to work correctly.
