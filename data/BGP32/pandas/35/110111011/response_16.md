## Buggy Function Analysis
- The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is a `cache_readonly` decorator that returns an instance of `_engine_type` by passing a weak reference of `self` to it.
- The error message indicates that an `AttributeError` is raised due to trying to access the `view` attribute on a `NoneType` object in the `_do_monotonic_check` function.

## Error Location
The `PeriodIndex` class's `_engine` function is returning a weak reference to `self` which is not properly handled during the check causing `NoneType` issues.

## Cause of the Bug
The issue occurs because the weak reference of `self` is not properly managed, leading to the `_engine` function failing to retrieve the necessary reference, result in the `NoneType` error.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly maintained and used in the `_engine` function to avoid the error. Proper handling of weak references will ensure that the `PeriodEngine` can access the necessary attributes without facing a `NoneType` error.

## Correction of the Buggy Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period() if period() is not None else None, len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference to `self` is explicitly checked before being used in the `_engine` function, preventing the `NoneType` error.
