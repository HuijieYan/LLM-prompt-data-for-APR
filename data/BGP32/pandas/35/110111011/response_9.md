### Identified Bug:
The bug occurs in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The issue is related to weak referencing of `self` which is causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `NoneType` object instead of a valid `PeriodIndex`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the weak referencing mechanism used in the `_engine` function. The weak reference is set up improperly, leading to the `NoneType` object being passed to the `PeriodEngine`. This results in an AttributeError when trying to access attributes or methods with no 'view' attribute.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, the weak reference setup should be corrected to ensure that a valid reference to `self` is passed to the `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# Corrected `_engine` function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By adjusting `period()` in the `return` statement, we fetch the actual `self` object, not the weak reference to `self`, which resolves the weak referencing issue leading to the `NoneType` object error.

With this fix, the `period()` generates the actual `self` object from the weak reference, ensuring that the `PeriodEngine` receives a valid `PeriodIndex` object, preventing the `NoneType` object issue.

### Updated Function Explanation:
- `period()` fetches the actual `self` object when used inside the `return` statement.
- `len(self)` provides the correct length of the index.
- This corrected version ensures that a valid reference to `self` is passed to the `_engine_type`, resolving the bug related to weak referencing.

By applying this fix, the function should now work as intended when tested with the provided failing test case.
