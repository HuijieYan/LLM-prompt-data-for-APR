## Identification of issue and fixing strategy

### Issue:
The `_engine` property in the `PeriodIndex` class tries to create a weak reference to `self` using `weakref.ref(self)`. However, there is an issue with the way the weak reference is created and stored, leading to a `NoneType` object subsequently during runtime. This causes the failing test to raise an `AttributeError`.

### Fixing strategy:
1. Ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly stored and utilized inside the `_engine` property.
2. Validate the weak reference object before accessing its attributes to avoid the `NoneType` error.

### Updated `_engine` function to fix the bug:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Properly store the weak reference to self
    self_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    
    return self._engine_type(self_weakref, len(self))
```

By correctly storing the weak reference in `self_weakref` and utilizing it in the `_engine_type`, we can avoid the `NoneType` error and ensure the weak reference is correctly maintained throughout.

Make sure to replace the existing `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class with the updated version provided above.

After implementing this fix, the failing test should pass without raising the `AttributeError`.
