### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is then passed to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`. However, the issue lies in the fact that `weakref.ref(self)` returns a weak reference object and not the actual object itself.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by passing a weak reference object (`weakref.ref(self)`) instead of the actual object `self` to the `_engine_type` constructor.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to pass the actual object `self` to `_engine_type` constructor instead of a weak reference object.

### Corrected Function
```python
    # this is the corrected function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
