### Bug Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using a `cache_readonly` decorator which suggests that the function is meant to be cached and readonly.
2. The error message is indicating an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.
3. The failing test is trying to check if the level values are monotonic, which involves calling the `is_monotonic()` method, ultimately leading to the error.
4. The bug seems to be related to the fact that the `_engine` function is returning `None` instead of the actual `_engine_type` instance, resulting in the attribute error when trying to access the `view` attribute.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug:
1. Ensure that the `_engine` function returns the `_engine_type` instance instead of `None`.
2. Make sure that the weak reference giving to the `_engine_type` can still maintain a reference to the `PeriodIndex` object.

### Corrected Version
```python
# Fix the buggy function _engine in the PeriodIndex class

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type
    return engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By ensuring that the `_engine` function correctly returns the `_engine_type` instance, the bug should be fixed, and the corrected function should pass the failing test.
