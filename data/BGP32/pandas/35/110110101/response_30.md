### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref` to create a weak reference to `self`, but it seems that the weak reference is not properly handled.
2. The error message indicates that the `AttributeError` is raised because a `NoneType` object (presumably the weak reference) is being accessed for an attribute that does not exist (`view`).
3. The expected output values and types indicate that the function should return an instance of `PeriodEngine`, but due to the bug, it seems to be returning `None` instead.

### Bug Fix Strategy
The bug fix strategy involves ensuring that the weak reference created does not lead to `NoneType` being returned. This can be achieved by properly handling the weak reference and creating an instance of `PeriodEngine` from it.

### Bug Fix
```python
    def _engine(self):
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))  # Create an instance of PeriodEngine
        return engine_type
```
