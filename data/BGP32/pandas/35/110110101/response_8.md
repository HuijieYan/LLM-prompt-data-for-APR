The bug in the `_engine` function arises from the line `period = weakref.ref(self)` where `weakref.ref` is used incorrectly. The correct usage should be `period = weakref.proxy(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object.

Explanation of the bug:
The bug occurs in the `test_get_level_values_when_periods` test function when trying to build a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` object. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` with `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, which is triggered due to the incorrect creation of a weak reference in the `_engine` function.

To fix the bug, we need to change `period = weakref.ref(self)` to `period = weakref.proxy(self)`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
