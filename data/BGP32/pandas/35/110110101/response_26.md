The bug in the `_engine` function seems to be related to the usage of weak references. In the provided code snippet, the weak reference is created but not properly utilized when invoking `_engine_type`. The error message indicates that a `NoneType` object is trying to access the `view` attribute, which suggests that the reference is not being properly passed or used.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly dereferenced before using it within the `_engine_type` constructor.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `period()` is used instead of just `period` to dereference the weak reference. By invoking `period()`, we obtain the actual reference to the `self` object to be used within `_engine_type`.

This correction should address the `NoneType` attribute error and ensure that the weak reference is properly utilized.
