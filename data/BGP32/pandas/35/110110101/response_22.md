### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using a weak reference `weakref.ref(self)` incorrectly. The intention seems to avoid a reference cycle by passing a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`.
2. The error message `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` indicates that the `_engine` method is returning `None` instead of the expected engine object.
3. The cause of the bug is likely due to the weak reference usage where the reference is not properly accessed to get the actual object.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correctly access the object from the weak reference and return the engine object.
5. Implement the correct object retrieval from the weak reference and return it.

### Fix
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Get the actual object from the weak reference
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
