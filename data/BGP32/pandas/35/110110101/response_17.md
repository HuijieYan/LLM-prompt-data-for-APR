The bug in the `_engine` function is likely due to the fact that it is returning `None` if the `self._engine_type` function does not return a valid engine. This leads to an AttributeError when trying to access the `view()` method on a `NoneType` object.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to handle the case where the `_engine_type` function does not return a valid engine. We can check if the engine is `None` and return an appropriate default engine in that case.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        # Handle the case where _engine_type returns None
        # You can modify this part to return a default engine or handle it in a different way
        return DefaultEngine()  # DefaultEngine is a placeholder, you can replace it with the appropriate default engine
    return engine
```

In this corrected version, we added a check after calling `_engine_type` to handle the case where it returns `None`. You can replace the `DefaultEngine()` placeholder with the appropriate default engine object based on your specific requirements.

By including this error handling logic, the corrected function should now be able to handle cases where the `_engine_type` function returns `None`, preventing the AttributeError observed in the failing test.
