### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class seems to be returning an instance of `_engine_type` with a weak reference to `self`. This weak reference is created using `weakref.ref(self)`.
2. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` related to a `NoneType` object not having the `view` attribute, suggesting that the weak reference creation might be causing the issue.
3. The failing test involves creating a `MultiIndex` from `PeriodIndex` objects and checking if the levels are monotonic. The bug in `_engine` function is causing the `is_monotonic` property check to fail.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is properly handled to avoid `NoneType` issues.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to correctly handle the weak reference creation and avoid the `NoneType` object error.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.proxy(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `weakref.proxy(self)` is used to create a weak reference to `self` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, which should resolve the `NoneType` attribute error.
