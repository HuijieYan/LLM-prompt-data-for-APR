### Analysis
1. **Buggy Function**: The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object. However, the issue arises from passing this weak reference to the `_engine_type` constructor with the length of the `self` object. This leads to an error where the engine type is not correctly assigned, resulting in a `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error when trying to access the engine internally.
   
2. **Failing Test**: The failing test involves creating a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` object and then testing if the resulting levels are monotonic. This failure occurs due to the incorrect initialization of the engine for the `PeriodIndex`.
   
3. **Error Message**: The error message indicates that the `_do_monotonic_check` method in the `IndexEngine` class is trying to access a `NoneType` object attribute 'view', leading to the `AttributeError`.
   
4. **Expected Input/Output Variables**:
   - The `_values` attribute of the `self` object in the `PeriodIndex` should contain the periods '2019Q1' and '2019Q2' as a `PeriodArray`.
   - The `self` object itself should represent a `PeriodIndex` with the specified periods.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Update the `_engine` function to correctly initialize the engine type with parameters reflecting the `self` object's actual data (`self._values`).
2. Ensure that the engine type created corresponds to the intended functionality to avoid the 'NoneType' error.

### Corrected Code
```python
# Corrected version of the `_engine` function in the PeriodIndex class

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Pass self._values and len(self) to engine type constructor
    return self._engine_type(self._values, len(self))
``` 

By passing `self._values` and `len(self)` to the `_engine_type` constructor, the corrected version ensures that the engine is correctly initialized with the actual data from the `PeriodIndex` object. This should resolve the issue and allow the test to pass successfully.
