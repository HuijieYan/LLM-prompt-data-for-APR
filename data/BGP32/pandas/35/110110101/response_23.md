### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class returns an instance of `_engine_type` using a weak reference to self. The intention is to prevent reference cycles to avoid memory leaks.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is checking the monotonicity of levels in a `MultiIndex` constructed from a `PeriodIndex`, but the bug causes an AttributeError due to a NoneType object.
3. The failing test expects the PeriodIndex to behave correctly when creating a MultiIndex from it and checking monotonicity, without any errors.
4. The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of the weak reference within the `_engine` function.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is properly utilized and that the `Period` object is correctly passed when creating the engine type instance.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to correctly pass the weak reference of self and the length of the `PeriodIndex` to the `_engine_type`. We also need to ensure that the `Period` object is correctly handled within this process.

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

This fix ensures that we pass a callable `period()` (dereferenced weak reference) instead of just the weak reference itself, resolving the AttributeError and ensuring proper behavior of the `PeriodIndex` class.
