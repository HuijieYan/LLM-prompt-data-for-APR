The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is trying to access `self._engine_type`, but it seems that the `_engine_type` attribute is not defined in the provided code snippet. Additionally, the reference to `period` using `weakref.ref(self)` might not be necessary.

To fix the bug, we should remove the unnecessary weak reference creation and make sure that the `_engine_type` attribute is defined. Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# Fixing the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By making these changes, the corrected function will now properly access the `_engine_type` attribute with `self` as the first argument. This should resolve the AttributeError issue we encountered during the failing test.
