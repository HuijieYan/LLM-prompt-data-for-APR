## Analysis
The `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error is occurring in the `_do_monotonic_check` method inside the `IndexEngine` class. This error is caused by the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class returning a `None` value instead of the expected `PeriodEngine` object, leading to the failure of the subsequent operations relying on the `_do_monotonic_check` method.

## Bug Cause
The buggy `_engine` function is using weak reference `weakref.ref(self)` to return the `_engine_type`, which is supposed to be a `PeriodEngine` object. However, due to the use of weak reference, the object returned is `None`, leading to the AttributeError when operations are performed on it. This is why the subsequent `_do_monotonic_check` method fails, as it tries to access an attribute on a `NoneType`.

## Fix Strategy
1. Instead of using a weak reference, directly return the `PeriodEngine` object from the `_engine` function.
2. Ensure that the `_engine_type` is correctly initialized with the required parameters.

## The corrected version of the `_engine` function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By making this modification, the correct `PeriodEngine` object will be returned by the `_engine` function, resolving the `NoneType` attribute issue and allowing the subsequent operations to be performed as expected.
