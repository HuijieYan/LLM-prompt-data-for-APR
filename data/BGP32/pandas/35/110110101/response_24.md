The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is attempting to create a weak reference to itself using `weakref.ref(self)` but is not handling the weak reference properly, leading to the error message during the failing test.

### Bug Explanation:
- The error message `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` indicates that there is an issue with trying to access an attribute (`view`) on a `None` object.
- The failing test is related to checking the monotonicity of the index levels, and the error occurs when trying to access the underlying values of the index.
- The root cause of the bug is that the `_engine` function is returning `None`, which leads to the error down the line when trying to access attributes on `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- The `_engine` function should correctly create a weak reference to itself and return the appropriate engine type instance.
- Ensure that the weak reference is handled correctly to prevent it from returning `None`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function _engine
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `period()` is called to obtain the actual object reference from the weak reference, and it is passed along with the length of the PeriodIndex to create the `_engine_type` instance correctly.

This fix should address the bug and ensure that the monotonicity check in the failing test passes successfully.
