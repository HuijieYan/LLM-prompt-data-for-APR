### Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the failing test
The buggy function `_engine` is part of the `PeriodIndex` class in the `pandas` library. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` based on a `PeriodIndex` object that includes some `Period` objects. The failing test triggers an error related to monotonicity checks in the index, specifically when trying to access the `_engine` attribute.

### Error location and cause
The error occurs when trying to access the `self._engine.is_monotonic_increasing` attribute within the `_engine` function. The error message indicates that a `NoneType` object has no attribute 'view', pointing to a problem with the `PeriodEngine` object being of type `None`.

The `_engine` method is meant to return an object of type `PeriodEngine`, but in its current implementation, it seems to return a `None` type, leading to errors when trying to access attributes of that `None` object.

### Bug fixing strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine` method returns a valid `PeriodEngine` object instead of `None`. One possible strategy is to instantiate a `PeriodEngine` object properly by passing the correct arguments during the `_engine` method call.

### Corrected version of the `_engine` function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if self._engine_type is not None else None
```

By incorporating the `if self._engine_type is not None` condition, we ensure that only valid `PeriodEngine` objects are returned by the `_engine` method. This correction should prevent the `NoneType` errors encountered during the failing test.
