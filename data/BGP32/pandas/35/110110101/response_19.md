The bug in the `_engine` function is causing the error due to a reference cycle issue. The `_engine` function is creating a weak reference to `self` and then trying to access the `_engine_type` with that weak reference, but due to incorrect handling of the weak reference, it results in an `AttributeError`.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the weak reference is correctly utilized to create the `period` instance before passing it to `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Use weakref to avoid a reference cycle
        weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(weak_period(), len(self))
```

This correction ensures that the weak reference of `self` is correctly utilized to create the `period` instance before accessing `_engine_type`. This fix should resolve the `AttributeError` observed in the failing test.
