### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is supposed to return an instance of `_engine_type` with a weak reference to `self`. However, the implementation is incorrect, resulting in an `AttributeError` during the test execution.
2. The error message indicates that a `NoneType` object does not have the attribute `view`, suggesting that the `_do_monotonic_check` method in the `IndexEngine` class is trying to access the values of the index engine which is `None`.
3. The bug is likely due to the incorrect initialization of the `period` variable when creating a weak reference to `self`. This leads to the `_engine` method returning a `None` instead of the expected engine instance.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correctly create a weak reference to `self` and ensure that the `_engine_type` constructor receives the appropriate arguments.

### Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` instead of just using `period`, we ensure that the weak reference is correctly accessed to get the value of `self`.

By making this change, the `_engine` method should now correctly return the instance of `_engine_type` with the expected values, satisfying the test case and eliminating the `AttributeError`.
