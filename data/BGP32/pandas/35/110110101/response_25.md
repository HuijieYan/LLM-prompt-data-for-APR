The bug in the `_engine` function is caused by the fact that it is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, but the `self` reference is being passed as a weak reference: `period = weakref.ref(self)`. This results in `self` being a weak reference object, leading to the AttributeError during the test execution.

To fix this bug, we need to retrieve the actual object referenced by the weak reference before using it. This can be done by calling `weakref()` on the weak reference object, which returns the referenced object or `None` if the object has been garbage collected. Hence, we should modify the `_engine` function to check if the weak reference still points to a valid object and if so, return that object.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    obj = period()
    if obj is not None:  # Check if the weak reference still points to a valid object
        return self._engine_type(obj, len(obj))
    else:
        raise RuntimeError("Weak reference is no longer valid")
```

By incorporating this change, the `_engine` function will return the actual object if the weak reference still points to it, thus resolving the AttributeError issue observed during the failing test execution.
