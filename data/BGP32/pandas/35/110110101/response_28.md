### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class returns an instance of `_engine_type` which is defined as `PeriodEngine`. The error is likely occurring within the `_engine_type` initialization.
2. The error message indicates an issue with a `NoneType` object trying to call the `view` function.
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is trying to check if the level values are monotonic, and the error is raised during this check due to the `NoneType` attribute issue.
4. The strategy to fix this bug is to ensure that the `_engine_type` initialization for `PeriodEngine` does not return a `NoneType` object, which is causing the attribute error.

### Bug Fix
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine_type is None:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type returned None")
    return engine_type
```

By adding a check after calling `_engine_type`, we ensure that it does not return `None` and raise an appropriate error if it does. This modification should prevent the `NoneType` attribute error and pass the failing test.
