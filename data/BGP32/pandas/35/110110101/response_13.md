### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`. However, it seems the `_engine_type` function is not handling the weak reference properly, leading to the AttributeError when trying to access an attribute from the weak reference.

### Bug Cause
- The bug is caused by passing a weak reference to `self` in `_engine` without handling it correctly in `_engine_type`. When trying to access attributes on the weak reference, it fails as the weak reference itself is None.

### Fix Strategy
- Modify the `_engine_type` function to properly handle the weak reference to `self` passed from `_engine`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

This fix removes the use of `weakref.ref(self)` and directly passes `self` to `_engine_type` in the `PeriodIndex` class.
