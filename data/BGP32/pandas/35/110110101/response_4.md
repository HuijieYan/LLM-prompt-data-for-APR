The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is attempting to create an instance of `self._engine_type` with parameters `period` and `len(self)`, where `period` is a weak reference to the `self` object. The issue arises from passing `len(self)` as the second parameter, which is causing an error when trying to access attributes of the weak reference.

To fix this bug, we should pass `self` directly as the second parameter to `_engine_type` instead of `len(self)`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, self)
```

By passing `self` instead of `len(self)` as the second parameter to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the `self` object itself is available within `_engine_type` without any issues related to weak references.

This correction should resolve the AttributeError issue observed in the failing test case, and the expected values and types of variables for the failing test case should now be as follows:

### Expected case 1
#### The values and types of buggy function's parameters
self._values, expected value: `<PeriodArray>
['2019Q1', '2019Q2']
Length: 2, dtype: period[Q-DEC]`, type: `PeriodArray`

self, expected value: `PeriodIndex(['2019Q1', '2019Q2'], dtype='period[Q-DEC]', freq='Q-DEC')`, type: `PeriodIndex`
