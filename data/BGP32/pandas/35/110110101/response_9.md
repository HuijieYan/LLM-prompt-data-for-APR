### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is utilizing the `weakref.ref()` function incorrectly, which is causing the `AttributeError` when trying to access the view of the `PeriodEngine` object.
2. The bug is introduced by passing the weak reference `period` to `_engine_type` constructor, which is causing the returned `PeriodEngine` object to be of `NoneType`.
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `PeriodIndex` object with two periods ('2019Q1', '2019Q2'), and then attempts to check if the levels are monotonic. This test fails due to the incorrect handling of weak references in the `_engine` function.
4. To fix the bug, the weak reference should be dereferenced before passing it to `_engine_type`.
5. The corrected version of the function `_engine` follows:

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Dereference the weakref to obtain the actual object
        period = self
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By updating the `_engine` function to dereference the weak reference correctly, the `AttributeError` should be resolved, and the corrected function should pass the failing test.
