## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object, which is the `PeriodIndex` instance. Then, it calls `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` to return an instance of the `_engine_type` class by passing the weak reference `period` and the length of `self`.
   
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `PeriodIndex` instance `idx` with two `Period` objects. It then creates a `MultiIndex` instance `idx2` by iterating over the levels of `idx` and calling `_get_level_values` function. In `assert all(x.is_monotonic for x in idx2.levels)`, it checks if all the levels in `idx2` are monotonic.
   
3. The error occurs when checking for monotonicity because the `_engine` method of `PeriodIndex` tries to access a non-existing attribute `vgetter` and leads to `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` call is returning `None` instead of an instance having the attribute `vgetter`, which is required for further processing. This leads to the `AttributeError` when trying to access `view("i8")`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
The bug can be fixed by checking the return value of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` to ensure it is not `None`. If it is `None`, an appropriate action should be taken such as raising an exception or handling the case differently.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
        if engine is None:
            raise RuntimeError("_engine_type returned None. Check implementation.")
        return engine
```
