### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class attempts to create a weak reference to `self` but incorrectly assigns it to `period` variable instead of using it directly.
2. The error message is raised when trying to access the `view` attribute on a `NoneType` object.
3. The expected behavior of the `_engine` function is to return an instance of the `_engine_type` class initialized with the weak reference to itself.
4. To fix the bug, we need to use the weak reference directly without assigning it to `period` variable. This way, we can ensure that `self` is properly referenced.

### Correction
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type directly.
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```

By directly passing the weak reference to `self._engine_type`, we avoid the AttributeError that was occurring in the failing test.
