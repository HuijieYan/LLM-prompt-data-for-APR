### Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class. The `PeriodEngine` class is trying to access an attribute that is `None`, causing the `AttributeError` during the test execution. This means that the `_engine_type` method might not have been set up correctly in the context of weak references.

### Bug Cause
The `weakref.ref(self)` creates a weak reference to the `self` object, meaning that if the `self` object is destroyed, the weak reference won't keep it alive. The issue is likely that when passing this weak reference to `_engine_type`, it might be losing the actual reference to the `PeriodIndex` object, leading to the `NoneType` error.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this issue, instead of creating a weak reference to the `self` object, it's better to directly pass the `self` object to the `_engine_type` method.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
