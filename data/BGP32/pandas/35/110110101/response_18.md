### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using a weak reference `period` to assign to the variable before returning the `_engine_type`.
2. The error occurs during the test execution where the `self._engine.is_monotonic_increasing` is accessed.
3. The error message indicates an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, suggesting that the `_engine` is returning `None`.
4. The cause of the bug is likely the weak reference not being set correctly, resulting in `None` being returned by `_engine`.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is set correctly to the `self` object.

### Updated Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
``` 

In the corrected version, the weak reference `period` is directly passed to the `_engine_type` constructor without assigning it to a variable before returning. This ensures that the correct reference is maintained, fixing the bug.
