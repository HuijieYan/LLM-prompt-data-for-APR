### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is intended to return an engine type for `PeriodIndex`. It's supposed to use a weak reference to avoid reference cycles.
2. The error is occurring in the `_do_monotonic_check` method due to an AttributeError related to a `NoneType` object trying to access an attribute `view`.
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is checking if all levels of the multi-index `idx2` are monotonic. It uses a `PeriodIndex` created with two periods '2019Q1' and '2019Q2'.
4. The bug could be related to the usage of weak references in the `_engine` function.

### Bug Explanation
The bug is likely caused by the `weakref.ref(self)` line in the `_engine` function returning a weak reference object rather than the expected reference to `self`. This may lead to the `PeriodEngine` being set to `None` instead of the intended behavior, triggering the AttributeError when trying to access an attribute later on in the code.

### Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that the weak reference is properly initialized and used to maintain a reference to `self`.
2. Verify that the engine creation and usage are correct to avoid potential `NoneType` errors.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

This modification ensures that `period()` is called to return the actual reference to `self` from the weak reference object, resolving the issue with potential `NoneType` errors in subsequent engine operations.
