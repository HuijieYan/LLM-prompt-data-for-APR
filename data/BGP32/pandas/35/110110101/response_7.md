### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class is utilizing a `cache_readonly` decorator to cache the result of the `_engine_type()` method based on weak reference to `self`.
2. The error message suggests an issue with accessing an attribute on a `NoneType` object within the `PeriodEngine` class.
3. The cause of the bug is related to weak reference handling and attribute access on the `NoneType` object generated by the weak reference. This leads to an `AttributeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is used correctly and that the access to attributes is valid without leading to `NoneType`.
5. Corrected code is provided below.

### Corrected Function
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Use weakref.proxy() to create weak reference proxy, and access it to prevent NoneType error
        period = weakref.proxy(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we create a weak reference proxy that allows attribute access without causing a `NoneType` error. This correction should resolve the issue observed in the failing test.
