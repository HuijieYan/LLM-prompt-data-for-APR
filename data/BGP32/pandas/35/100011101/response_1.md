### Analysis
The error message indicates an issue with accessing the `view` attribute on a `NoneType` object. This suggests that the `_engine_type` method is returning `None`, causing the error when trying to access the `view` attribute on it.

The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, but it should actually be passing `self` directly to `_engine_type`.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to pass `self` directly to `_engine_type` instead of creating a weak reference.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the updated file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
``` 

By making this change, the function will correctly pass `self` without creating a weak reference, resolving the issue of returning `None` and fixing the bug causing the AttributeError.
