The bug in the provided function `_engine` is that it returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` without properly handling the weak reference `period`. This leads to an error at runtime when trying to access attributes of a weak reference object.

To fix this bug, we need to dereference the weak reference object `period` before passing it to `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Dereference the weakref object before passing it to _engine_type
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By dereferencing the `period` weak reference object using `period()`, we ensure that we are passing the actual object referenced by the weak reference to `_engine_type`.

This corrected version should resolve the error message you were encountering and pass the failing test case.
