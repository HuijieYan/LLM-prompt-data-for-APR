### Analysis
The error message indicates that a `NoneType` object doesn't have the attribute `view`, pointing to an issue in accessing the attribute from the `PeriodEngine`.

The buggy function `_engine` is creating a weak reference to `self`, but it's not being used correctly. The weak reference should be passed to the `_engine_type` method, but instead, the weak reference object `period` is being returned directly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly pass the weak reference `period` of `self` to the `_engine_type` method.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `period()` is used to retrieve the actual object from the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`. This change ensures that the weak reference is properly dereferenced and the expected object is passed to `_engine_type`.
