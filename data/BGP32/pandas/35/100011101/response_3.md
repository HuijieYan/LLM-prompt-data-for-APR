The bug in the provided `_engine` function arises from the fact that the `weakref.ref` method returns a weak reference object, not the actual object itself. Therefore, when passing `period` as an argument to `self._engine_type`, it is receiving a weak reference object instead of the original `self`. This leads to the `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error when trying to access an attribute on the weak reference.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to properly extract the original object from the weak reference before passing it to `self._engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By directly passing `self` to `self._engine_type`, we ensure that the actual object is used instead of a weak reference, resolving the AttributeError issue.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and correctly handle the input/output values as expected.
