The bug in the provided function `_engine` is that it returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` without properly handling the weak reference `period`. This results in an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` when trying to access the view from `super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter().view("i8")`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is properly handled. One approach is to dereference the weak reference `period` before passing it to `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Dereference the weak reference before passing it to _engine_type
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By dereferencing `period` before passing it to `_engine_type`, we avoid passing a `NoneType` object and prevent the `AttributeError`.

This corrected version should resolve the issue with the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
