The bug in the `_engine` function is likely causing a reference cycle issue due to the use of `weakref.ref(self)`. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as the AttributeError when trying to access an attribute of a `NoneType`.

To fix this issue, we can replace `weakref.ref(self)` with `self` directly. This will ensure that we pass the actual object reference instead of a weak reference, resolving the problem.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By making this change, the function should no longer create a weak reference to `self`, preventing the reference cycle issue and resolving the AttributeError problem. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
