### Analysis
The error message indicates an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`. This typically occurs when trying to access an attribute or method of a `None` object. In this case, the issue likely stems from the `_engine` function returning `None` instead of the expected `PeriodEngine` instance. This could be due to the `weakref.ref(self)` call not properly referencing the `self` object.

### Bug Explanation
The `weakref.ref(self)` creates a weak reference to the `self` object, but it should be called as a function, `weakref.ref(self)()` to return the actual reference to the object. Without the `()` at the end, the result is a weak reference object which leads to the `NoneType` error when trying to access its attributes.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `weakref.ref(self)` is called to get the reference to the object. By adding `()` at the end, the function will return the object itself rather than a weak reference.

### Code Fix
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
