The bug in the provided function lies in the line `period = weakref.ref(self)`. The issue is that `weakref.ref()` returns a weak reference object, not the referenced object itself. Therefore, when `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` is called, it's actually passing a weak reference object instead of the intended `self` object.

To fix this bug, we need to retrieve the referenced object from the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`. We can achieve this by calling `period()` to get the referenced object. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By using `period()` after creating the weak reference, we ensure that the correct object is passed to `_engine_type`. This correction should resolve the AttributeError issue encountered in the failing test.
