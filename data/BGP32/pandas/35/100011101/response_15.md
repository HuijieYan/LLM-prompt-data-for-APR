### Bug Explanation
In the `_engine` function, the `weakref.ref(self)` is assigned to `period`, but the reference is not being retrieved correctly when calling `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. This leads to the error `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` because the `_do_monotonic_check` method is trying to access an attribute on `self._engine`, which is None.

### Bug Fix Strategy
We need to ensure that the reference is correctly retrieved from the weak reference `period` before using it in `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

This corrected version will correctly retrieve the reference from the weak reference object before using it in the `_engine_type` method.
