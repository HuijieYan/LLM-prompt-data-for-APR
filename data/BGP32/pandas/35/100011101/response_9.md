### Analysis
The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `PeriodEngine` object being accessed as `NoneType` leading to an `AttributeError` when calling the `view` method.

Looking at the buggy function, the problem seems to stem from the use of `weakref.ref(self)` where `self` is a reference to the `PeriodIndex` object. The weak reference might be causing the `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` call to return `None`, resulting in the `AttributeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference created using `weakref.ref(self)` does not interfere with the `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` call. One way to achieve this is by directly passing `self` to the `_engine_type` method instead of using a weak reference.

### Corrected Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By directly passing `self`, we avoid the weak reference issue that was causing the `NoneType` error. This corrected version should now return the expected `PeriodEngine` object and resolve the `AttributeError`.
