### Analysis
The error message indicates an AttributeError related to a 'NoneType' object that has no attribute 'view'. This suggests that the `_engine` function is returning `None` instead of the expected engine object, leading to the AttributeError when trying to access the view attribute.

Looking at the implementation of the `_engine` function, we see that a weak reference to `self` is being passed to `_engine_type`, which is expected to return the engine object. The issue seems to be that the weak reference is not being properly resolved, resulting in `None` being returned instead of the engine object.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by incorrectly handling the weak reference in `_engine`. Instead of creating a weak reference to `self`, the `_engine_type` function should receive the actual `self` object.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to pass the actual `self` object to the `_engine_type` function instead of a weak reference.

### Corrected Version

def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
