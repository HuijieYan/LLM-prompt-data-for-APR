### Analysis
The error message indicates an `AttributeError` related to a `NoneType` object when trying to access the `view` attribute. This error occurs because the `_engine` function is returning `None` instead of the expected `PeriodEngine` object.

### Bug
The bug in the `_engine` function is that it is not properly creating the `period` weak reference to `self`. This leads to `period` being `None` when it is passed to `_engine_type`, resulting in `None` being returned instead of the correct `PeriodEngine` object.

### Fix
To fix the bug, the `weakref.ref` function should be called with `self` as an argument to create a weak reference properly.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
