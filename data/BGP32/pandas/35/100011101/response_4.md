### Analysis
The error message indicates an AttributeError related to a 'NoneType' object that has no attribute 'view'. This typically occurs when trying to access an attribute or method of a None object.

Looking at the buggy function `_engine`, it seems that the issue lies in the `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))` line. The `period` variable is created as a weak reference to `self`, but the weak reference might not be correctly utilized in the `_engine_type` method.

### Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by passing the weak reference `period` incorrectly to the `_engine_type` method, leading to the creation of a 'NoneType' object instead of the expected engine object.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is appropriately handled when passing it to the `_engine_type` method. We should retrieve the `self` object from the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

By calling `period()` instead of just passing `period`, we retrieve the actual `self` object from the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`. This should prevent the 'NoneType' error and resolve the bug.
