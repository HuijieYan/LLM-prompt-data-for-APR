### Analysis
The error message indicates an `AttributeError` on a `NoneType` object. This error is likely due to the `_engine` function returning `None` instead of the expected engine object, leading to the subsequent error when trying to access attributes on a `None` object.

Looking at the `_engine` function, it appears to be creating a `weakref` object to reference `self` and then initialize the engine with that weak reference. However, the implementation is incorrect causing it to return `None` instead of the engine object.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine` function returns the engine object created using the weak reference of `self`. This involves correcting the weak reference creation method and then using it to properly initialize and return the engine object.

### The corrected version

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Correctly create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine
```
