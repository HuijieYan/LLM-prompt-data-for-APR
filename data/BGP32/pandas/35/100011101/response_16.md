### Fixing the bug
The bug in the `_engine` function is that it is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, where `period` is a weak reference to `self`, but the `_engine_type` method is not handling weak references correctly, resulting in an AttributeError when trying to access the view method on a None object.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to pass the actual object instead of a weak reference to it.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By passing `self` directly to the `_engine_type` method, we ensure that it receives the actual object instead of a weak reference to it, preventing the AttributeError that was occurring in the failing test.
