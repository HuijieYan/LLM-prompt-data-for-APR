Based on the error message and the provided information, the bug seems to be related to the `PeriodEngine` object not being properly initialized. The error message indicates that a 'NoneType' object is being accessed for the `view` attribute, implying that the `_do_monotonic_check` method is returning `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine` method returns a valid `PeriodEngine` object instead of `None`. One way to achieve this is by properly initializing the `PeriodEngine` object with the `period` argument using the weak reference.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In this corrected version, `period()` is called to return the actual object referred to by the weak reference, providing a valid reference to the `PeriodEngine` object.

This fix should ensure that the `PeriodEngine` object is properly instantiated with the weak reference, resolving the 'NoneType' attribute access issue pointed out in the error message.
