### Analysis:
The error message indicates an `AttributeError` where a `NoneType` object has no attribute `view`. This error occurs within the `is_monotonic_increasing` method of the `IndexEngine` class. The buggy function `_engine` returns a weak reference to `self`, but it seems that the `_engine_type` method is not correctly handling the weak reference. This leads to the `NoneType` object error.

### Bug Cause:
The `_engine_type` method is not properly handling the weak reference `period` returned by `weakref.ref(self)`, resulting in a `NoneType` object where an actual object is expected. This causes the `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is properly handled by `_engine_type` and the actual object being passed to it. We may need to dereference the weak reference to get the actual object before passing it to `_engine_type`.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

from pandas._libs.interval import IntervalIndex

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Dereference the weak reference to get the actual object
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By dereferencing the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the actual object is used properly, avoiding the `NoneType` error. This corrected version of the function should resolve the bug and pass the failing test.
