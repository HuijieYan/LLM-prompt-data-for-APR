The bug in the provided function `_engine` is that it returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, where `period` is defined as a weak reference which is causing the error when used later on, leading to an attribute error. 

To fix this, we should obtain the actual object from the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Get the actual object from the weak reference
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This change ensures that the weak reference is correctly converted to the actual object before being passed to `_engine_type`, fixing the attribute error issue.
