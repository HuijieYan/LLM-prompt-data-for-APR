### Analysis
The error message indicates that there is an issue with the attribute `view` being called on a `NoneType` object. This implies that `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` is returning `None` instead of an object that should have the `view` method.

### Bug Description
The bug in the code is that the weak reference `period` is not being correctly dereferenced to obtain the actual object it refers to when calling `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. This results in `None` being returned instead of the expected object.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this issue, we need to properly dereference the weak reference `period` before passing it to `self._engine_type`.

### The corrected version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

In the corrected version, `period = weakref.ref(self)()` ensures that the weak reference is dereferenced, allowing the actual object to be passed to `_engine_type`.
