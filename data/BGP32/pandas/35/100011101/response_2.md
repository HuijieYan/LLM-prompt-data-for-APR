The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` incorrectly. The purpose of `weakref.ref` is to create a weak reference to the object, allowing the object to be garbage collected if there are no strong references to it. However, in this case, it seems like the intention is to pass `self` as a weak reference to `_engine_type`. 

The error message indicates that there is an issue with `view("i8")`, which suggests that `_engine_type` might not be returning the expected value.

To fix this bug, you should pass `self` as a weak reference correctly. Here is the corrected version:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Pass a weak reference of self using `weakref.proxy`
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, you correctly pass `self` as a weak reference to `_engine_type`.

Make sure to test the corrected function with the failing test scenario to ensure that it resolves the issue.
