### Analysis
The error message indicates an `AttributeError` due to `NoneType` object not having the attribute 'view'. This error occurs when trying to access an attribute on a `None` object. In the provided buggy function `_engine`, the problem lies in the return statement where `self._engine_type` seems to be returning `None` instead of the expected engine object.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, ensure that `self._engine_type` is correctly returning an engine object instead of `None`.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_obj = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine_obj is None:
        # Handle the case where self._engine_type returns None
        raise ValueError("Engine creation failed.")
    return engine_obj
```
