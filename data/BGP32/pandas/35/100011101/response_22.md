### Analysis
The `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error suggests that the `_engine` function is returning `None` instead of the expected engine object. This is causing subsequent errors when trying to access attributes or methods on this `None` object.

### Bug Cause
The `_engine` function is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. However, the `weakref.ref` call is not properly capturing a reference to `self`. This results in `period` being a weak reference object referencing `None`. Consequently, `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` also returns `None` instead of the expected engine object.

### Fix Strategy
Ensure that the weak reference object correctly captures a reference to `self` so that the engine object is properly initialized and returned.

### Corrected code
```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By invoking the weak reference object with `()` after `weakref.ref(self)`, we obtain the actual referenced object `self`. This corrected implementation ensures that the engine object is correctly initialized and returned.
