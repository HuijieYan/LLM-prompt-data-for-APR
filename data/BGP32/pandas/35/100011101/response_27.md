The bug in the `_engine` function is likely caused by the weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)`. Weak references in Python return `None` when weakly referenced objects are disposed. In this case, `period` ends up being `None`, leading to the error when trying to access a method on it.

To fix this bug, we should ensure that the weak reference is passed correctly without being converted to `None`. One way to do this is by storing the weak reference object in a variable that remains within the function scope.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    def weak_period(obj):
        return weakref.ref(obj)
    
    period = weak_period(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In this corrected version, the `weak_period` function ensures that the weak reference is maintained appropriately. This should resolve the issue and prevent the `AttributeError` from occurring.
