The bug in the provided function `_engine` is that it is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` without properly handling the weak reference `period` created using `weakref.ref(self)`. This results in an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error when trying to access an attribute of a `NoneType` object.

To fix this bug, we need to properly handle the weak reference `period`. We can do this by modifying the function to use `period()` to access the original object from the weak reference before passing it to `self._engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By using `period()` to access the original object referenced by the weak reference, we ensure that we are working with the actual object and not a `NoneType` object.

This correction should resolve the `AttributeError` issue and make the function work as intended.
