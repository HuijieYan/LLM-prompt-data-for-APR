The bug in the `_engine` function is caused by passing a weak reference to `self` to `_engine_type` instead of the actual `self`. This results in the `_engine_type` function receiving None instead of the intended `self`.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `_engine` function to pass `self` directly to `_engine_type` instead of a weak reference.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

This corrected version should solve the issue encountered in the failing test, ensuring that the `_engine_type` function receives the correct reference to `self`.
