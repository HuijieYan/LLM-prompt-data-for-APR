The bug in the provided function `_engine` is due to the weak reference `period` not being properly utilized when creating the `_engine_type` object. This results in the `_engine_type` object being created with a `NoneType` value, leading to the `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is properly used to access the original object when creating the `_engine_type` object.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` instead of simply passing `period` as an argument to `_engine_type`, we are accessing the original object from the weak reference. This should resolve the `AttributeError` issue and ensure the function works correctly with the expected input/output values.
