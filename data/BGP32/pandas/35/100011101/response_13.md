The issue in the provided function is that the `weakref.ref` is not being correctly used. When calling `weakref.ref(self)`, it does not create a reference to the object `self`, but instead creates a weak reference object that needs to be accessed with `weakref.proxy()` or `weakref.Reference()`.

### Bug Explanation:
- The `_engine` method is supposed to create a weak reference to the `self` object which is then used in the `_engine_type` method. However, by calling `weakref.ref(self)`, a weak reference object is created but not properly used.
- This leads to an `AttributeError` when trying to access attributes or methods of `self` through the weak reference.

### Fix Strategy:
- Instead of directly returning the weak reference object, we need to get the actual reference using `weakref.proxy()` to ensure correct functioning of the weak reference mechanism.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use weakref.proxy to create a reference for self
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` in the corrected version, we ensure that the weak reference used in the `_engine_type` method points to the actual object `self`, resolving the `AttributeError` issue.
