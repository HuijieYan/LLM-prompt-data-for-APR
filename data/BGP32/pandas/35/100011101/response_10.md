## Analysis
The bug occurs when trying to access an attribute/method on a `NoneType` object in the `_engine` function. This leads to an `AttributeError` during the test execution. 

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` call might be returning `None` unexpectedly.
2. Possible incorrect implementation of the `_engine_type` method that is supposed to return an object with a `view` attribute.
3. The weak reference initialization `period = weakref.ref(self)` could be incorrect.

### Bug Cause:
The error occurs when trying to access `view("i8")` on a `NoneType` object. This indicates that `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` is returning `None` instead of the expected object. 

### Fix Strategy:
1. Verify the implementation of the `_engine_type` method or class to ensure it returns the expected object.
2. Check the weak reference usage and initialization.

## Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_obj = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    if engine_obj is None:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type returned None unexpectedly")
    
    return engine_obj
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly check if `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` returns `None` and raise a `ValueError` in such a case. This change ensures that a `NoneType` is not returned, preventing the AttributeError.
