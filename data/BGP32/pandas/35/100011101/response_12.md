Based on the provided information, the bug in the `_engine` function is likely related to how the `period` object is created using `weakref.ref(self)`. The error message indicates that a `NoneType` object has no attribute 'view', leading to an attribute error.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` does not result in a `NoneType` object when accessed. One way to achieve this is by dereferencing the weak reference when passing it to `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    period_obj = period_ref()
    return self._engine_type(period_obj, len(self))
```

By storing the result of `period_ref()` in `period_obj`, we ensure that we pass a valid object to `_engine_type` instead of a potentially `NoneType` object. This correction should prevent the attribute error mentioned in the failing test.
