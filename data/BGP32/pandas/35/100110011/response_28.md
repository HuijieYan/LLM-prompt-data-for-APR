### Analysis:
1. The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` but it mistakenly assigns it to `period` without calling `period()` to actually create the weak reference object.
2. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` with `NoneType` object trying to access `view` attribute.
3. The bug causes the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` object instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`, leading to an `AttributeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correctly create the weak reference object by calling `period = weakref.ref(self)()`.
5. The corrected version of the `_engine` function is provided below.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Fix: Create the weak reference object by calling ()
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By fixing the assignment of the weak reference object, the bug should be resolved, and the corrected version should pass the failing test and address the GitHub issue related to losing weakrefs.
