### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is causing an AttributeError when trying to access `view("i8")`. This is resulting in a 'NoneType' object error.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` tries to check if all levels in the `MultiIndex` created from `PeriodIndex` objects are monotonic.
3. The issue mentioned on GitHub highlights the problem of losing weakrefs when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`, leading to a `NoneType` error in the `PeriodEngine`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `_engine` method returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` without handling the weak reference properly. When creating the `PeriodEngine`, it's facing issues due to the weak reference handling.

### Strategy for Fixing:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained properly throughout the `_engine` method. This way, the `PeriodEngine` can access the necessary attributes without causing a `NoneType` error.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the _engine method
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self), weak_ref=True)
```

By passing the `weak_ref=True` argument to the `_engine_type` constructor, we ensure that the weakref to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained, preventing the AttributeError from occurring.

This correction should resolve the issue mentioned on GitHub and allow the failing test to pass without encountering the 'NoneType' error.
