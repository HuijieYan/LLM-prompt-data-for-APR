### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the file `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` is trying to create a weak reference to `self` using `weakref.ref(self)`, but it's not handling the weak reference properly.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` in the file `pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py` is trying to check the monotonicity of levels in `idx2` which is created from a `MultiIndex`.
3. The error occurs when accessing the `is_monotonic` property of `x`, which internally tries to access the `_engine` attribute, leading to an `AttributeError` due to a `NoneType`.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the problem where weakrefs are not being handled correctly, leading to the `NoneType` error when the `PeriodEngine` tries to get a view of the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex`.

### Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly handled and not lost prematurely. We can modify the `_engine` function to ensure that the reference doesn't get lost. Here is the corrected version:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference, but keep it alive to prevent premature loss
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    self._weak_period = period
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By keeping the weak reference alive in an attribute `_weak_period` of the object, we prevent it from being lost prematurely and avoid the `NoneType` error. This modification addresses the issue described in the GitHub bug report and should make the failing test pass without errors.
