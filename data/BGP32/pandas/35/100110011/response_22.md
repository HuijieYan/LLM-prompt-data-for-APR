### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` in `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` is not correctly creating a weak reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This results in a weakly referenced object being dropped before intended, leading to an `AttributeError` when the `is_monotonic` method is called on the engine.

The failing test in `pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py` tries to assert the monotonicity of the levels in a `MultiIndex`, which indirectly calls the `_engine` method in `PeriodEngine` class, triggering the issue due to weak referencing problems.

The GitHub issue titled "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs" highlights the weak reference issue and provides an example code snippet that triggers the problem.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the weak reference to `self` not being created correctly in the `_engine` method of the `PeriodEngine` class. This results in the `_engine_type` method receiving a weakly referenced object that gets dropped prematurely, leading to an `AttributeError` later on.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `_engine` method should create a proper weak reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This ensures that the `PeriodEngine` instance is kept alive until the intended usage is complete, solving the weak reference issue.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_weakref, len(self))
```

With this change, the weak reference to `self` is correctly created as `period_weakref`, ensuring that the `PeriodEngine` instance does not get dropped prematurely. This corrected version should resolve the weak reference issue and pass the failing test successfully.
