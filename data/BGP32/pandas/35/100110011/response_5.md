### Analyzing the Bug

#### Issue Summary
The bug relates to weak references being dropped prematurely in `PeriodEngine`, leading to `NoneType` errors in `is_monotonic_increasing`.

#### Error Location
The issue lies in the `_engine` function where a weak reference to `self` is created, but the reference might be lost before needed in `PeriodEngine`.

#### Bug Cause
Due to weak referencing, when `_engine_type` attempts to access the weak reference, it receives `None` due to the premature drop of the reference.

#### Bug Fix Strategy
Ensure the weak reference is retained until it is utilized in `PeriodEngine` to prevent getting `NoneType`.

### Buggy Function - Fixed Version

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    def _return_period():
        return self

    period = weakref.ref(_return_period)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

### Updated Explanation
The revised function retains the reference to `self` by embedding it within a local function `_return_period` to ensure it is available for `PeriodEngine`.

This modification allows the weak reference mechanism to function correctly and prevent `NoneType` errors in the `is_monotonic_increasing` method.
