### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a cached read-only function that is meant to create an engine instance based on `self` and its length.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` involves creating multiple `MultiIndex` instances from a `PeriodIndex` and then checking if the levels are monotonic.
3. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` related to calling `view("i8") on a `NoneType` object.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the problem where weak references are being lost prematurely, leading to a `NoneType` object in the `PeriodEngine` causing the error.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy `_engine` function incorrectly uses `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, which results in premature loss of the weak reference. This leads to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` object, causing the `AttributeError`.

### Fix Strategy:
To resolve the issue, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until it is no longer needed. One approach is to store the weak reference outside of the `_engine` function for as long as it is required by the engine.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Fix for the buggy function
def _engine(self):
    if not hasattr(self, '_period_weakref'):
        self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    period = self._period_weakref
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, the weak reference to `self` is stored as an attribute `_period_weakref`. This ensures that the weak reference persists as long as necessary for the engine to function correctly.
