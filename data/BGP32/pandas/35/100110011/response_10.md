### Bug Analysis:
1. The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to avoid reference cycles, but the issue occurs when accessing the `_engine` property in `is_monotonic_increasing` where it expects a `PeriodEngine` object but gets a `None` instead.
2. The failing test is checking if the levels of a `MultiIndex` are monotonic, but due to the bug in `_engine`, it fails with an `AttributeError`.
3. The error occurs because the `PeriodEngine` object is not properly created due to the weak reference handling in the `_engine` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
The fix involves ensuring that the `PeriodEngine` object is correctly instantiated to resolve the `NoneType` error. We can modify the `_engine` function to correctly handle the creation of the `PeriodEngine` object.

### Corrected Code:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))

# The corrected code should create the PeriodEngine object properly
```

By correctly creating the `PeriodEngine` object in the `_engine` function, the issue of receiving a `NoneType` error should be resolved. This fix ensures that the weak reference handling does not interfere with the creation of the necessary engine object.
