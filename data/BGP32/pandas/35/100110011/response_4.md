### Analyzing the Bug:

1. The buggy function `_engine` in `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, where `period` is a weak reference to `self`.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values` in `pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py` utilizes a `MultiIndex` created from a `PeriodIndex`. However, when checking for monotonicity, the test encounters an `AttributeError` due to a `NoneType` object.
3. The error message specifically points to an issue with attribute `'view'`.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the problem with weak references being dropped prematurely in constructing `MultiIndex` from `PeriodIndex`, leading to the `NoneType` error.

### Bug Cause:

The bug is caused by premature dropping of weak references to `PeriodIndex` instances in the process of constructing the `MultiIndex`, resulting in a `NoneType` object being passed to `PeriodEngine`.

### Fix Strategy:

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `PeriodIndex` is correctly maintained through the process of creating a `MultiIndex` so that the `PeriodEngine` receives a valid reference, preventing the `AttributeError`.

### Corrected Function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self._data)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By updating the weak reference to `self._data` instead of `self`, we maintain the reference to the `PeriodIndex` and prevent it from being dropped prematurely.

This correction should resolve the `AttributeError` issue identified in the failing test.
