### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self` (which is a `PeriodIndex` instance) and then passing it to `_engine_type`.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` in `pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py` checks if all levels in the `MultiIndex` object `idx2` are monotonic, but it fails with an `AttributeError` related to 'NoneType' not having the attribute 'view'.
3. The error occurs because the weak reference created inside `_engine` is not properly referencing the `PeriodIndex` object, leading to a `NoneType` being passed instead of the actual object to the `_engine_type`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference created in `_engine` holds a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex` object throughout its usage.
5. A corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Updated Corrected Version of `_engine` Function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Correct weakref usage to hold a reference to the actual object
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we can pass a proxy to the object that allows access to its attributes and methods without the risk of breaking the weak reference. This change should resolve the issue and ensure proper handling of the weak reference within the `_engine` function.
