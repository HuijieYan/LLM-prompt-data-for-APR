### Analysis:
1. The `_engine` function in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file is marked as `@cache_readonly`, indicating it should return a cached value and avoid creating a new instance on each call.
   
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` in `pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py` attempts to check if the returned levels are monotonic by calling `x.is_monotonic` for each level.

3. The error message shows an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` occurring within `return super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter().view("i8")` in `_do_monotonic_check` method.

4. The GitHub issue indicates that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is getting dropped before intended, resulting in a `None` value being passed to `PeriodEngine`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to the weak reference being incorrectly handled, leading to the removal of the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` prematurely, as mentioned in the GitHub issue description.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` (the `PeriodIndex` instance) is maintained until it is safely used in the `_engine_type` function. This involves correcting the weak reference implementation in the `_engine` function.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The corrected _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self), self)
```

By correcting the `_engine` function to include the weak reference to `self` as an additional parameter passed to `_engine_type`, we can ensure that the weak reference is used correctly, resolving the `NoneType` error and maintaining the weak reference as intended.
