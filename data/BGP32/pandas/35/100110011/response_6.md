### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object, but it seems that it is not being handled correctly causing an attribute error.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` tries to check if all levels in `idx2` are monotonic, but it leads to an error related to `_engine` and `view`.
3. The error message points to an attribute error `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` which indicates that the `_engine` function might not be returning a valid object.
4. The GitHub issue indicates a problem with weak references being dropped before intended, leading to issues with the `PeriodEngine`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused because the weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` is not being properly handled and the `_engine` function is returning a `NoneType` object instead of a valid `PeriodEngine`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is correctly maintained throughout the function and that the `period` variable is accessed properly to create the `PeriodEngine` object.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    period_ref = period()  # Get the referenced object
    if period_ref:
        return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
    return None
```

By explicitly accessing the referenced object using `period()`, we ensure that a valid object is passed to `_engine_type` function, preventing the attribute error caused by passing a `NoneType` object.
