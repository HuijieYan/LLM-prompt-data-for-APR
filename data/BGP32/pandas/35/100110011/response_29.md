### Analysis:
1. The `_engine` function in `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` is using weak references which might be causing the issue when trying to access the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` in the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` from `pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py`.
2. The error message indicates an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, which might be due to the weak reference being accessed incorrectly.
3. Based on the GitHub issue, the problem seems to be related to dropping the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` early, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` reference.
4. A potential fix could involve ensuring the weak reference is maintained until it's no longer needed to prevent it from being garbage collected prematurely.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))


# Apply a fix to maintain the weak reference until the _engine_type method is called
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we can ensure that the weak reference remains valid until after it's used by `_engine_type`, which should prevent the `NoneType` reference error.
