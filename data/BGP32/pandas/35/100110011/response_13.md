### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using weak references to avoid reference cycles.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is trying to check if all levels of a `idx2` MultiIndex object are monotonic.
3. The error occurs due to an attribute error when trying to get the view from `PeriodEngine`.
4. The GitHub issue points out the problem of losing weakrefs during the copying of MultiIndex levels from PeriodIndex.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the weak reference `period` is not being preserved correctly, leading to a `NoneType` being passed to the `PeriodEngine`, resulting in the AttributeError when attempting to get the view.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` (PeriodIndex) is maintained properly when creating the PeriodEngine. This can be achieved by ensuring the weak reference object is kept alive while it's being used.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    class MyPeriodEngine(PeriodEngine):
        def __init__(self, period, length):
            super().__init__(period, length)
            self.period = period
            
        def view(self, dtype):
            return self.values.astype(dtype)
        
    return MyPeriodEngine(weak_period, len(self))
```

By keeping a reference to `self` within the `MyPeriodEngine` class, the weak reference will be preserved during the engine's lifetime, preventing the AttributeError.
