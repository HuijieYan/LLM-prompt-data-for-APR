### Analysis:
The bug is related to the `_engine` method in the `PeriodEngine` class. The `_engine` method utilizes a weak reference to `self`, specifically a `PeriodIndex`, to prevent a reference cycle. However, the weak reference is not established correctly, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` object instead of the `PeriodIndex`, resulting in the AttributeError when accessing attributes of the `None` object.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the `_engine` method within the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect establishment of a weak reference in the `_engine` method. The weak reference to `self` is not correctly passed to the `_engine_type` constructor, resulting in a `NoneType` object being returned.

### Fixing Strategy:
To fix the bug, the correct way to establish a weak reference to `self` and pass it to `_engine_type` needs to be implemented. This will ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives the actual `PeriodIndex` instead of a `None` object.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By modifying the usage of `weakref.ref(self)` to `weakref.ref(self)()` inside the `_engine` method, we are correctly obtaining the referenced object before passing to `_engine_type`, ensuring that the `PeriodEngine` receives the actual `PeriodIndex`.
