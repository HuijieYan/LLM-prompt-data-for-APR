### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a cached readonly property that returns an instance of `_engine_type` class.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` using `PeriodIndex` and checks if the levels are monotonic.
3. The error message indicates an AttributeError related to `NoneType` object in the `_do_monotonic_check` method.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by improper handling of weak references in the `_engine` function. The weak reference created using `weakref.ref(self)` is not passed correctly to `_engine_type`, resulting in a `NoneType` object being passed causing attribute errors.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the weak reference is properly maintained and passed to `_engine_type`.
2. Handle weak references appropriately to avoid losing references prematurely.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By updating the `_engine` function to pass the weak reference object correctly by calling it `period()`, we ensure that the reference remains valid when passed to `_engine_type`.

This correction should resolve the AttributeError issue and align with the expected behavior as described in the GitHub issue.
