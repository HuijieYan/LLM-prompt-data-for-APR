### Analysis:
1. The bug is related to weak reference handling in the `_engine` function of the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file.
2. The failing test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods` checks if the levels of a `MultiIndex` are monotonic, but due to weak reference handling issue, it results in an AttributeError.
3. The error occurs when trying to access the `view` attribute on a NoneType object in the `pandas/_libs/index.pyx` file.
4. The bug causes a weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to be dropped prematurely, leading to None being passed to the `PeriodEngine`, resulting in the AttributeError.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference instance (`period`) is properly maintained until it is used in the `_engine_type` creation.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `_engine` function to ensure the weak reference instance `period` remains valid throughout.
2. Update the weak reference creation and retrieval process to handle the weak reference correctly.

### Corrected Version of the `_engine` function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# Corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))  # Corrected by calling the weak reference to get the original object
```

By updating the `_engine` function to ensure that the weak reference instance is properly fetched using `period()`, the bug related to premature weak reference dropping should be resolved. This corrected version should address the issue described in the failing test and the GitHub report by maintaining the weak reference integrity.
