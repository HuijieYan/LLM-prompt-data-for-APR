### Analyzing the Buggy Function and Test Code

- The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` function that returns an instance of `self._engine_type`.
- The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is checking if all level values from `idx2` are monotonic.
- The error message indicates an `AttributeError` related to a `NoneType` object not having the attribute 'view'.
- The GitHub issue describes the problem where weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before intended, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

### Identifying Potential Error Locations
- The issue may be related to the weak reference handling in the `_engine` function.
- The problem might arise from how the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` instance is handled in `PeriodEngine`.

### Cause of the Bug
- The bug is caused by the weak reference of `self` being assigned to `period`, but not being handled correctly, leading to `NoneType` issues within the `PeriodEngine`.
- The weak reference might be getting lost or dropped prematurely, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex` instance.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is properly handled and maintains the reference to `self` until it is no longer needed. Additionally, we need to make sure that the `PeriodEngine` receives the correct `PeriodIndex` instance.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    def _create_engine(ref):
        return self._engine_type(ref, len(self))

    period = weakref.ref(self, _create_engine)
    return period()
```

In the corrected version:
- We define a new inner function `_create_engine` that receives the weak reference (`ref`) and creates the `self._engine_type` instance.
- The weak reference `period` is created with the inner function `_create_engine`.
- Finally, instead of returning `period` directly, we call `period()` to obtain the actual `self._engine_type` instance.

This correction ensures that the weak reference `period` is maintained properly and used to create the `self._engine_type` instance when needed, fixing the issue of receiving `NoneType` in the `PeriodEngine`.
