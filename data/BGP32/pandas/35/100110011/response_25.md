### Analysis:
- **Buggy Function**: The `_engine` function in `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` returns an instance of `_engine_type` with a weak reference to self (the index object).
- **Failing Test**: The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` in `pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py` checks if certain properties are preserved after copying levels of a `MultiIndex` with `PeriodIndex`.
- **Error Message**: The error occurs due to an `AttributeError` in `pandas/_libs/index.pyx` when trying to access `view("i8")` on a `NoneType` object.
- **GitHub Issue**: The bug involves losing weakrefs during copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`, resulting in a `NoneType` passed to `PeriodEngine`.

### Bug Cause:
- The `_engine` function likely loses the weak reference when the `PeriodIndex` levels are copied to a new `MultiIndex`, resulting in `None` being passed to `PeriodEngine`, leading to the `AttributeError` during access.

### Fix Strategy:
- Ensure that the weak reference is maintained correctly during the operation that involves copying levels of `PeriodIndex` on `MultiIndex`.
- Adjust the `_engine` function in a way that the weakref to `self` remains valid throughout the process to prevent passing `None` where it is expected.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Maintain a weak reference to self.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Pass the weakref instance while copying levels to prevent losing weakref.
    new_index = self.copy(deep=False)
    new_index.levels = [level.copy() for level in self.levels]
    # Ensure the weakref is still valid before creating `_engine_type`.
    if period() is not None:
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    raise RuntimeError("Weakref to self is no longer valid.")
