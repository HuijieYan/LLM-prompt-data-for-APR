### Analyzing the Bug

1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` (PeriodIndex). The purpose of using weak references is to avoid reference cycles.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is creating a MultiIndex from a PeriodIndex and then checking if all levels are monotonic.
3. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` where a 'NoneType' object is trying to access the `view()` method, causing the failure.
4. The GitHub issue mentions that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to PeriodIndex (self) is maintained correctly, so it is not dropped prematurely. This can be achieved by modifying how the weak reference to self is handled in the `_engine` function.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
# The corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self, lambda wr: wr.__create__)
    # Pass the weak reference to _engine_type
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By adding the lambda function `lambda wr: wr.__create__` when creating the weak reference, we ensure that the weak reference maintains a reference to `self` until it is no longer needed, thus preventing the premature dropping of the weakly referenced PeriodIndex. This change should resolve the AttributeError and make the test pass.
