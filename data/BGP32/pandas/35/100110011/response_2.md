### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine(self)` is using weak referencing with `weakref.ref(self)` to avoid reference cycles.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a MultiIndex from a PeriodIndex, tries to get level values, and then checks if the levels of the resulting MultiIndex are monotonic.
3. The error message indicates an AttributeError related to `view("i8") on a NoneType object` within the `_engine_type` method due to weak referencing issues.
4. The GitHub issue points out that weakly referenced objects are being dropped prematurely, leading to this error.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by premature dropping of weakly referenced objects in `_engine(self)` function, resulting in a `NoneType`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak referencing does not lead to early object drops. One way to handle this is by making sure the weakly referenced object stays valid throughout. We can achieve this by storing the weak reference in a variable outside the function to maintain the reference.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store weak reference outside the function
    self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference outside the function in the corrected version, we ensure that the reference to the object remains valid while being used in `_engine_type`. This change should prevent the premature dropping of weakly referenced objects and resolve the AttributeError.
