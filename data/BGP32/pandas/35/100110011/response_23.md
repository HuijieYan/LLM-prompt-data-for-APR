### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`. The issue is caused by the weak reference being discarded prematurely.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` tries to assert that all level values in `idx2` are monotonic. This test fails due to an `AttributeError` related to 'NoneType' object.
3. The error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` is receiving a `NoneType` object instead of a `PeriodIndex`, leading to an `AttributeError` when trying to access an attribute on the `NoneType` object.
4. To fix the bug, the weak reference should be stored correctly so that it doesn't get discarded before it is needed. The corrected version should ensure that the weak reference remains valid during the operation.

### Bug Fix:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _engine(self):
    # Storing weakref properly to prevent premature discarding
    self._weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._weakref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference in an attribute of the object, it ensures that the weak reference remains valid throughout the operation.
