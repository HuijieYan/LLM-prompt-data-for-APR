### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`, but it is not used correctly.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is encountering an `AttributeError` related to the incorrect usage of weak reference.
3. The error occurs when the weak reference pointing to the `PeriodEngine` returns `None`, causing an `AttributeError`.
4. To fix the bug, the weak reference needs to be properly stored and accessed within the `_engine` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Store the weak reference created by `weakref.ref(self)` in a separate variable to ensure it is accessible within the `_engine` function.
2. Modify the `_engine` function to correctly retrieve the referenced object from the weak reference before using it.

### Corrected Version:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self
    weak_self = weakref.ref(self)
    # Retrieve the referenced object from the weak reference
    period = weak_self()
    if period is None:
        # Handle the case where the weak reference returns None
        raise ValueError("Weak reference lost")
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By using the correct way to handle weak references in the `_engine` function, the corrected version will address the issue of losing weak references and prevent the `AttributeError` encountered in the failing test.
