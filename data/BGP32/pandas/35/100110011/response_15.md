### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to self, but due to some issue, it is returning `None` instead of the intended `period`. This behavior is leading to the AttributeError when the `_do_monotonic_check` method is called with a `NoneType`.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is checking whether all the levels in the `idx2` MultiIndex are monotonic. This test fails due to the underlying issue in the `_engine` function.
3. The error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` is receiving a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`, resulting in an AttributeError while trying to access the `view` attribute.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference created by `weakref.ref(self)` in the `_engine` function is correctly storing the reference to `self` without returning `None`.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `_engine` function to correctly handle the weak reference creation.
2. Ensure that the weak reference `period` indeed contains the reference to `self`.
3. Update the function to avoid the AttributeError when accessing the weak reference.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This corrected version ensures that the weak reference `period` is correctly obtained by immediately calling `weakref.ref(self)()` to convert it back to a strong reference.

By applying this fix, the `_engine` function should now return the proper reference, resolving the issue and allowing the test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` to pass without raising any errors.
