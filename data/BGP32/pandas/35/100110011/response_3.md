### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference of `self` (which is an instance of a class) but not handling it properly.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is trying to access `is_monotonic` property of an object, which ultimately relies on the `_engine` function's correctness.
3. The error message indicates that in the step `return super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter().view("i8")`, a `NoneType` object is being encountered.
4. The GitHub issue mentions that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped too soon, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.
5. The current implementation of `_engine` is not correctly handling weak references.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy `_engine` function does not properly maintain the weak reference created using `weakref.ref(self)`. As a result, when the weakly referenced object is accessed, it might return `None`, causing the subsequent error in the `is_monotonic` property check.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, the weak reference should be maintained properly within the `_engine` function to ensure that the intended object is accessible. Here is the corrected version of the function:

### Corrected Code:
```python
import weakref
from pandas.util._decorators import Appender, cache_readonly, doc

# Corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By modifying the `period()` call inside `_engine`, we ensure that the weakly referenced object is accessed correctly, resolving the bug discussed.
