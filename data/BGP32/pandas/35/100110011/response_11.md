### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` is using weakref in a way that causing the engine type to receive a None object instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` in `pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py` expects `is_monotonic` to return correctly but encounters an AttributeError due to passing a None object to `view("i8")`.
3. The GitHub issue describes the problem accurately where weakrefs are being dropped prematurely leading to the unexpected behavior.
   
### Solution Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weakref referencing `PeriodIndex` is properly retained until the intended point of usage to create the `PeriodEngine`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `period()` is used to retrieve the `PeriodIndex` object from the weak reference at the point of engine creation. This change ensures that a valid `PeriodIndex` object is passed to the `PeriodEngine`.
