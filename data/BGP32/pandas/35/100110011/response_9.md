### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine()` in the `period.py` file is using `weakref.ref()` to keep a weak reference to `self` to avoid a reference cycle.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods()` in the `test_get_level_values.py` file is trying to assert that all levels in the `idx2` MultiIndex are monotonic using `assert all(x.is_monotonic for x in idx2.levels)`.
3. The error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` is trying to access an attribute on a `NoneType` object causing an `AttributeError`.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped prematurely before the `PeriodEngine` can access it, leading to a `NoneType` object error.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is accessible by the `PeriodEngine` when needed. We can achieve this by modifying how the weak reference is stored and accessed within the `_engine()` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference as an instance attribute
    self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference as an instance attribute (`self._period_ref`), we ensure that the `PeriodIndex` object is available when accessed by the `PeriodEngine`, avoiding the `NoneType` error.

This corrected version should resolve the bug and make the failing test pass successfully.
