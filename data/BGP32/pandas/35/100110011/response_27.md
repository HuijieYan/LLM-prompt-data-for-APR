### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` in pandas/core/indexes/period.py is using weakref to create a weak reference to `self`, but the issue arises because the weak reference is not maintained properly and ends up being dropped unexpectedly. This leads to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` object instead of the `PeriodIndex` it expects. This bug is related to the copying of `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` losing weak references, as indicated in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug lies in the weak referencing mechanism not being properly maintained, leading to the weak reference being lost prematurely. This results in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` object instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`, causing the AttributeError during the test in `test_get_level_values_when_periods`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is handled properly to prevent it from being lost prematurely. This can be achieved by modifying the `_engine` function to maintain the weak reference correctly throughout its usage.

### Updated Corrected Function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Properly maintain the weak reference to self
    if not hasattr(self, '_period_weakref'):
        self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

In this corrected version, we first check if a weak reference attribute `_period_weakref` exists in the object. If not, we create and store a weak reference to `self` using `weakref.ref(self)`. This modification ensures that the weak reference is maintained throughout the usage of `_engine`, preventing it from being dropped prematurely.

By applying this fix, the bug related to losing weakrefs during the copying of `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` should be resolved, and the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` should pass without raising any AttributeError.
