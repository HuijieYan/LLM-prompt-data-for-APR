### Analysis:
1. The `PeriodEngine` object within the buggy `_engine` function is losing its weak reference to the `PeriodIndex`.
2. This is leading to the error observed in the failing test related to the `PeriodEngine` not being able to access the necessary attributes, resulting in the `AttributeError`.

### Bug Cause:
The `weakref.ref(self)` call in the `_engine` function is creating a weak reference to `self` (the `PeriodIndex` object) but is not correctly maintaining the reference throughout its usage, resulting in the loss of weak reference.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained properly within the `_engine` function by storing it in a variable and using it appropriately.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference to self in a variable
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    # Create a bound method for _engine_type that preserves the weak reference
    engine_instance = self._engine_type.__func__(period_ref, len(self))
    # Ensure a suitable return based on the design
    return engine_instance
```

By storing the weak reference in `period_ref` and then using it appropriately within the `_engine` function, the corrected version ensures that the `PeriodEngine` object retains the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex`, preventing the loss of reference and resolving the `AttributeError` observed in the failing test.
