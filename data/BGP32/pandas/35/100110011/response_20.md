### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the file `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` is supposed to create and return an engine object based on the given period index.
2. The error message in the failing test (`test_get_level_values_when_periods`) indicates that the `PeriodEngine` is returning a `NoneType` object instead of the expected `view("i8")`.
3. The GitHub issue points out that weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped prematurely, leading to the engine receiving a `None` object.
4. The bug arises from the premature dropping of the weakly referenced period index.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, ensure that the weak reference to the period index is not lost prematurely. This can be achieved by modifying how the weak reference is handled within the `_engine` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    # Store the weak reference as an attribute to prevent it from being deleted.
    self._weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._weak_period, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference to the period index as an attribute of the object, we prevent it from being deleted prematurely, resolving the issue of the engine receiving a `NoneType` object.
