### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is meant to return the `_engine_type` attribute with a weak reference to self. The bug seems to be related to how the weak reference to `self` is implemented.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is checking the monotonicity of levels after creating a MultiIndex from a PeriodIndex. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` related to 'NoneType'.
3. The bug seems to be causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `NoneType` object instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to self is correctly passed to `_engine_type` to avoid any dropping of references prematurely.
5. By ensuring that the weak reference is properly utilized, we can prevent the NoneType error from occurring.

### Bug Fix:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

### Description of Fix:
- By changing `period` to `period()`, we are correctly dereferencing the weak reference to obtain the actual `self` object before passing it to `_engine_type`.
- This change ensures that the `PeriodEngine` receives the valid `self` object instead of a `NoneType`, resolving the `AttributeError` issue.
- The fix aligns with the intention of maintaining a weak reference to `self` and utilizing it properly within the `_engine` function.
