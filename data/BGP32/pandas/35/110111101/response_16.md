Based on the error message and the provided information, the bug seems to be in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` related to the `NoneType`. This suggests that there might be an issue with the `_engine_type` method returning `None` instead of the expected value.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `_engine_type` method returns the correct type of object. Based on the `weakref.ref(self)` usage in the `_engine` function, it seems like the `_engine_type` method should accept a `weakref` object as an argument. Therefore, we need to update the `_engine_type` method to correctly handle the `weakref` object.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
        if engine_type is None:
            engine_type = self._engine_type
        return engine_type
```

This modification ensures that the `_engine` function handles the case where `_engine_type` returns `None` by falling back to the default `_engine_type`.

After applying this correction, the function should behave correctly and pass the failing test.
