## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `_engine_type` function is receiving a weak reference object `period` instead of the actual object `self`, leading to an AttributeError when trying to access the view attribute of a NoneType object.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should pass the actual object `self` to the `_engine_type` function instead of a weak reference object.

## The corrected version of the `_engine` function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By making this correction, the `_engine` function will pass the actual object `self` to the `_engine_type` function, resolving the AttributeError issue. This fix should allow the failing test to pass as expected.
