The bug in the provided function `_engine` is likely due to the `self._engine_type` function returning a `NoneType` object, leading to an `AttributeError` when `view("i8")` is called on it.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `_engine` function to handle the case where the `_engine_type` function returns `None`. One approach is to check if the result of `_engine_type` is not `None` before calling `view("i8")`. If it is `None`, we can return a default value or raise an exception.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_result = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine_result is not None:
        return engine_result
    else:
        raise ValueError("Engine type returned None.")
```

This modification ensures that if the `_engine_type` function returns `None`, an exception is raised with a meaningful error message.

This correction should address the issue identified in the failing test and prevent the `AttributeError` from occurring.
