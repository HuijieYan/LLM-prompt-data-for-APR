## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using a weak reference to the `self` object, but it seems that the weak reference is not being correctly utilized in the `_engine_type` instantiation, leading to an `AttributeError`.
2. The failing test is trying to access the `is_monotonic` attribute of the `MultiIndex` object, which internally relies on the `is_monotonic_increasing` attribute. However, due to the error in the `_engine` function, the `is_monotonic_increasing` attribute is not being properly defined, causing an `AttributeError`.

## Bug Explanation
The bug is caused by not correctly handling the weak reference in the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class. When trying to access attributes that depend on the `_engine` method, it results in an `AttributeError` due to the weak reference not being properly resolved.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_engine` method to correctly handle the weak reference. We can use the `weakref` object's `()` method to get a strong reference to the weak reference, and then pass that to the `_engine_type` constructor.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _engine(self):
    # Get a strong reference to the weak reference
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    
    if period is None:
        return None
    
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using the `()` method on the weak reference, we ensure that we have a strong reference to the object referenced by the weak reference, allowing the `_engine_type` constructor to function correctly.
