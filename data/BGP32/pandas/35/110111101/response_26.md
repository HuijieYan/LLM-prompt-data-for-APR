The bug in the `_engine` function arises from the fact that it returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` without properly handling the weak reference to `self`. This can lead to the `weakref.ref` operation returning `None` in some cases, as evidenced by the error message showing an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is correctly used to avoid circular references and potential memory leaks. We can modify the function as follows:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    period_instance = period()
    if period_instance is not None:
        return self._engine_type(period_instance, len(self))
    raise RuntimeError("Weak reference to self is None")
```

By checking if the weak reference `period()` returns a non-None value before proceeding, we can prevent the `NoneType` error encountered in the failing test case. This revised function ensures that the weak reference is properly handled and used to create the engine instance.

This modification should fix the bug and allow the failing test case to pass successfully.
