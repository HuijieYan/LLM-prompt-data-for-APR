The issue in the buggy function `_engine` is that the `weakref.ref` is returning `None`, so when trying to access attributes of `self._engine`, it results in an AttributeError.

To fix this issue, we need to modify how the weak reference is created and stored. Instead of directly creating a weak reference, we can store it as an instance variable in the PeriodIndex class.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    if not hasattr(self, '_period_weakref'):
        self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference in the instance variable `_period_weakref`, we ensure that the weak reference remains valid and the function works correctly.

This correction should address the issue with the failing test and the AttributeError that was previously encountered.
