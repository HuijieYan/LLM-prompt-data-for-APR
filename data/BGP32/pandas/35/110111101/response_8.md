### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `_engine_type` function expects to receive `period` as a weak reference object, but the `period` is being assigned as a weak reference to `self` directly, which causes an attribute error when trying to access `view` from a `NoneType` object.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to pass a weak reference to `self` when calling the `_engine_type` function. We can achieve this by modifying the `_engine` function to create a weak reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version
```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
