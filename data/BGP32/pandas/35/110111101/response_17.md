The bug in the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class occurs because the `self._engine_type` method is expecting a weak reference to `self` as an input argument but is receiving an actual reference instead. This causes an issue where the `PeriodEngine` instance is `None`, leading to an AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute on a non-existent object.

To fix this bug, we need to correctly pass a weak reference to `self` using the `weakref.ref` function. The corrected version of the `_engine` method should look like this:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By passing a weak reference to `self`, we ensure that the `PeriodEngine` instance will be correctly initialized and prevent the AttributeError that was occurring before. This fix should address the failing test case provided.
