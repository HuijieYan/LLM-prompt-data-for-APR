## Bug Explanation
In the buggy `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class, the issue arises due to the use of `self._engine_type` module which does not return a valid object, leading to an attribute error. The error occurs because the `self._engine_type` method is returning `None` instead of the expected engine object.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `self._engine_type` returns a valid engine object instead of `None`. We can achieve this by checking the logic within `_engine_type` and correcting it if necessary.

## The Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        return self._default_index_engine(len(self))
    return engine
```

In the corrected version, we first create the engine object using `self._engine_type` and then check if the engine is `None`. If it is `None`, we fall back to creating a default index engine by calling `self._default_index_engine`. This ensures that a valid engine object is returned, fixing the attribute error.
