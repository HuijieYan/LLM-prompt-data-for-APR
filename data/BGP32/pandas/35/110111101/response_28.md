Based on the error message and the runtime variables, the issue seems to be with the `_engine_type` method called in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The error message indicates that a `NoneType` object is being accessed for `view("i8")`, suggesting that the `_engine_type` method may be returning `None` unexpectedly.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `_engine_type` method returns a valid object instead of `None`. One possible strategy is to verify the implementation of the `_engine_type` method and make sure that it always returns the expected object.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        engine = self._get_default_engine()
    return engine
```

In the corrected version, after calling the `_engine_type` method, we check if the returned object is `None` and then obtain a default engine if needed. This should prevent the attribute access error mentioned in the failing test.
