### Bug Analysis:
The bug lies within the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file. The issue seems to be related to the `_engine_type` not properly handling the weak reference to self when creating the engine, which leads to a `NoneType` error when trying to access the view.

### Bug Explanation:
The failing test is attempting to create a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` and then check if the resulting levels are monotonic. During this process, the `is_monotonic` property of `MultiIndex` relies on the `_engine.is_monotonic_increasing` method, which ultimately accesses the `view` attribute. However, due to the bug in the `_engine` function, the `_engine_type` is not properly handling the weak reference to self, leading to a `NoneType` error when trying to access the view attribute.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to self is handled correctly within the `_engine` function so that the `_engine_type` can construct the engine without any issues. We should also make sure that the return value of `_engine` is an instance of an appropriate engine type that can handle the necessary operations.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self), dtype='i8')
```

By explicitly specifying the `dtype='i8'` when creating the engine, we ensure that the engine has the necessary type information to handle the operations effectively. This correction should address the `NoneType` error and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
