## Bug Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The function is supposed to return an instance of `_engine_type` but is returning an incorrect value, leading to an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute.

The function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`. However, the weak reference itself is causing the issue because it is not properly being used to access `self` later on in the code.

## Bug Explanation
1. The `_engine` function is creating a weak reference to `self` using `period = weakref.ref(self)`.
2. The weak reference `period` is then passed to `_engine_type`, but it is not correctly used to access `self` later on.
3. When `_do_monotonic_check` tries to access values from the weak reference, it fails and raises an `AttributeError`.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is correctly dereferenced to access `self` when needed. One way to achieve this is by using the weak reference object correctly to access the original object before interacting with it. After correcting this, the `_engine` function should return the expected `_engine_type` instance without causing any `AttributeError`.

## Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Dereference the weak reference before passing to _engine_type
    period = self if isinstance(self, weakref.ReferenceType) else weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
