### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class returns an instance of `self._engine_type`. The bug appears to be related to how the weak reference `period` is passed as an argument to `_engine_type`.
2. The error message indicates that an attribute error occurs within the `_engine` function, specifically on the line `return super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter().view("i8")`.
3. The failing test creates a `MultiIndex` with `PeriodIndex` objects, which triggers the bug due to the usage of `PeriodIndex._engine`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is correctly utilized when creating the engine instance.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Pass the weak reference `period` as an argument to `_engine_type` correctly.
2. Make sure that the correct type is returned from the `_engine` function.

### Corrected Version of the `_engine` Function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

With this correction, the weak reference will be invoked to retrieve the actual `self` object when creating the engine instance, resolving the attribute error issue during runtime.
