The bug in the `_engine` function is causing an `AttributeError` because the function is returning a `NoneType` object instead of the expected type when trying to access the `view` attribute. This leads to a failing test since the `is_monotonic` function relies on `_engine` to be correctly implemented.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `_engine` returns an instance of `PeriodEngine` instead of potentially returning `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("Engine creation failed")
    
    return engine
```

This correction ensures that if `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` returns `None`, an exception is raised to indicate the failure to create the engine. By doing this, we prevent the AttributeError from occurring and satisfy the expected behavior.
