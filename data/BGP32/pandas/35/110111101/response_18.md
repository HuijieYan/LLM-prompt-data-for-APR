Based on the analysis of the provided information, it seems that the bug in the `_engine` function is related to the `PeriodEngine` class not being properly initialized, which leads to an `AttributeError`. This is likely causing the failing test due to incorrect handling of the engine type.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `PeriodEngine` class is properly initialized with the weak reference to the `self` parameter. Additionally, we need to handle the case where the engine type is `None` and prevent the `AttributeError`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type
    if engine_type is None:
        return None
    return engine_type(weak_period, len(self))
```

By checking for the `None` case before attempting to access attributes or methods on the engine type, we handle the scenario that was causing the `AttributeError`. This should ensure that the engine is properly initialized and prevent the failing test.
