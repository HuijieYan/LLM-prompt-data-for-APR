### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` (PeriodIndex object), but it is not correctly passing this weak reference along with the length of `self` to the `_engine_type` constructor.
2. The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError related to the 'view' attribute when trying to access the values of the PeriodEngine.
3. The failing test involves creating a MultiIndex from a PeriodIndex and then checking if the resulting levels are monotonic, which triggers the call to the `is_monotonic` function.
4. The bug is likely due to the weak reference usage in `_engine` not properly handling the reference to `self` when trying to access attributes related to the underlying index values.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly used to access the underlying data.

### Bug Fix
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` instead of just `period`, we obtain the underlying object from the weak reference and pass it along with the length to `_engine_type`. This should address the bug by correctly handling the reference to the PeriodIndex object and its data.
