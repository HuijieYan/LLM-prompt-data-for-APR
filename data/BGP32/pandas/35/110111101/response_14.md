1. **Analysis:**
   - The buggy function `_engine` is part of the `PeriodIndex` class in the `pandas.core.indexes.period` module.
   - The function is using a `cache_readonly` decorator to cache the return value.
   - The function is expected to return an instance of `_engine_type` by passing a weak reference of `self` and the length of `self`.
   - The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` constructs a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` and checks if the levels are monotonic.

2. **Error Location:**
   The error seems to be related to the `_engine` function's implementation, specifically in the return statement where it creates an instance of `_engine_type`.

3. **Cause of the Bug:**
   When the `_engine` function is called, it is returning an instance of `_engine_type` that causes an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` in the failing test. This suggests that the `_engine_type` is not being correctly initialized or is returning `None` instead of a valid object.

4. **Bug Fix Strategy:**
   To address the `AttributeError`, it is necessary to ensure that the `_engine_type` initialization is correct within the `_engine` function. You may need to check the `_engine_type` implementation and ensure that it returns a valid object. Additionally, verify that the weak reference handling is appropriate.

5. **Corrected Version:**
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        engine_instance = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
        if engine_instance is None:
            raise ValueError("Failed to create the engine instance")
        return engine_instance
```

By explicitly checking for `None` values from `_engine_type` before returning, we can prevent the `AttributeError` caused by returning a `NoneType` object. This correction ensures that a valid `engine_instance` is returned, meeting the expected behavior.
