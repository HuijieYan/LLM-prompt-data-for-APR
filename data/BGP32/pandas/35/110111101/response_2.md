The bug in the `_engine` function is causing an `AttributeError` due to the `return super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter().view("i8")` line where the `NoneType` object is trying to access the `view` attribute.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `_engine_type` is correctly initialized and returned. The issue lies in the way `weakref` is used in this context. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)` in the return statement, we ensure that a weak reference to `self` is used without losing access to the object itself, thus preventing the `NoneType` attribute error.

This correction should address the issue reported in the failing test.
