The bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class is that it returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` without checking if `self._engine_type` is None or not. The error message indicates that 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view', which means the `_engine_type` is None.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when `_engine_type` is None. We can modify the `_engine` function to check for `_engine_type` before trying to instantiate it. If `_engine_type` is None, we should raise an exception or return an appropriate value based on the requirements.

Corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    if self._engine_type is None:
        raise ValueError("No engine type is specified.")
    
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By adding this check, we ensure that the `_engine` function does not attempt to instantiate the engine type when it is not available.

This corrected version should pass the failing test mentioned.
