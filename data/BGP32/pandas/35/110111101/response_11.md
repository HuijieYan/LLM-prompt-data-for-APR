The bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class arises from the fact that the `self._engine_type` constructor is being called with `period` as a weak reference, which leads to an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `period` reference is properly converted before being passed to the constructor.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Convert self to a weak reference to avoid reference cycles
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    period = period()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By directly calling `period()` after creating the weak reference, we convert the weak reference to the actual referenced object, which resolves the `AttributeError` that was occurring.

With this correction, the `_engine` function should now correctly pass the failing test and return the expected output values.
