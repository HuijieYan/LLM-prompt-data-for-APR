## Fixing the Bug

### Bug Description
The bug occurs in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class when it tries to access the `_engine_type` attribute with a weak reference to `self`. The issue arises because the weak reference is being passed directly, causing `_engine_type` to receive a `NoneType` object instead of the expected PeriodIndex instance.

### Fix Strategy
Instead of passing a direct weak reference to `self` to `_engine_type`, we should dereference the weak reference before passing it. This will ensure that the actual `PeriodIndex` instance is passed to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Dereference the weak reference before passing it
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    period_deref = period()
    
    return self._engine_type(period_deref, len(self))
```

With this corrected version, the weak reference is dereferenced before being passed to `_engine_type`, ensuring that the `PeriodIndex` instance is correctly received. This fix should resolve the `AttributeError` related to the `NoneType` object and make the failing test pass as expected.
