The bug in the `_engine` function seems to be related to how the weak reference is used. The function is attempting to create a weak reference to the `self` object but is not properly handling the reference and hence resulting in an attribute error when trying to access the weak reference.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is appropriately created and accessed. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))  # Access the weak reference properly by calling period()
```

In the corrected version, `period()` is used to access the object referenced by the weak reference `period`.

This correction should resolve the attribute error and make the failing test pass.
