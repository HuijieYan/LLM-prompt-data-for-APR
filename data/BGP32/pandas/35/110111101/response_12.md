Based on the provided information, the bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class is likely causing the failing test. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` due to a `NoneType` object not having the attribute `view`.

The cause of this bug is likely related to the `_engine_type` function not being correctly initialized with the weak reference `period`. The `_engine_type` function is trying to access a method or attribute of the weak reference, but it ends up being `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure the weak reference is properly passed and used within the `_engine` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if self._engine_type is not None else None
```

In this correction, we added a check for the `_engine_type` variable to ensure it is not `None` before calling it with the weak reference. This check prevents the `AttributeError` in case `_engine_type` is not properly initialized.
