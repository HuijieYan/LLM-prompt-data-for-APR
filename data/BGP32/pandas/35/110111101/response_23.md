### Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function `_engine` is meant to return an instance of `_engine_type` initialized with a weak reference to `self` (an instance of `PeriodIndex`) and the length of self. The issue arises from the fact that `period` is not being properly handled as a weak reference.

### Error Location
The bug lies in the way `period` is created as a weak reference. The usage of `weakref.ref()` is incorrect in this context.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug stems from the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref()` which doesn't properly create a weak reference. This leads to the `period` being an incomplete reference, resulting in the subsequent error when trying to access `_engine_type` with the incomplete reference.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug
To fix the bug, we should directly pass `self` to the `_engine_type` constructor without creating a weak reference explicitly.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
# Corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
``` 

With this correction, the function should now return the expected output and resolve the error seen in the failing test.
