The buggy function `_engine` is attempting to create an instance of `_engine_type` by passing `period` and the length of `self` as arguments. The issue arises from the weak reference usage on `period`. The weak reference is not being properly accessed, leading to the AttributeError in the failing test.

To fix this bug, we need to retrieve the actual referenced object from the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`. Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Retrieve the object from the weak reference
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This fix ensures that the object retrieved from the weak reference is used as intended, preventing the AttributeError in the failing test.
