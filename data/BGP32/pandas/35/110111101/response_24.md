## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is not correctly instantiating the `_engine_type` class due to a weak reference issue. When creating a weak reference using `weakref.ref(self)`, the reference to `self` is potentially being garbage collected too early, resulting in a `NoneType` object being returned when trying to access attributes or methods through the weak reference.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` does not get garbage collected prematurely. One way to achieve this is by storing the weak reference in a class attribute to retain the reference for the lifetime of the `PeriodIndex` instance.

## The Corrected Implementation
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference in a class attribute to prevent premature garbage collection
    self._weak_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._weak_ref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference in the `_weak_ref` attribute of the `PeriodIndex` instance, we can ensure that the reference is kept alive until the instance is no longer needed, preventing the `NoneType` issue when accessing attributes or methods through the weak reference.
