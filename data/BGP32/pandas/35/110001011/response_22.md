### Analysis:
1. The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is intended to create a weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object and pass it to `_engine_type` to avoid reference cycle issues.
2. The bug seems to be related to the weak reference handling, as it is not correctly implemented.
3. The issue arises when copying `PeriodIndex` levels in a `MultiIndex`, leading to weak references being lost.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is properly maintained within the `_engine` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect implementation of the weak reference in the `_engine` function. The weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object is not being passed correctly to `_engine_type`, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly create and maintain the weak reference of the `PeriodIndex` object within the `_engine` function so that it is passed correctly to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Correctly create a weak reference to self
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By using `period()` instead of just `period`, we ensure that the weak reference is properly dereferenced to obtain the original `PeriodIndex` object when passed to `_engine_type`. This should fix the weak reference issue and resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
