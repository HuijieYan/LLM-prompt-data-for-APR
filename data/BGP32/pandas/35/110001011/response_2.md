### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is intended to return an instance of `_engine_type` with a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance passed to it. However, the weak reference is not being properly maintained, leading to issues when accessing the `PeriodIndex` instance later. This bug is related to losing weak references, as indicated in the GitHub issue.

### Error locations
1. The weak reference `period` is created but not stored or maintained properly within the `_engine` function.
2. When calling `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, the weak reference `period` might not be accessible due to scope issues.

### Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the weak reference not being correctly stored or accessed within the `_engine` function. This results in the `PeriodEngine` receiving None instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`, leading to issues when accessing the `PeriodIndex` instance.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance is properly maintained within the `_engine` function. This involves storing the weak reference in a variable that has sufficient scope to be accessible when needed.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
# Corrected version of the _engine function

def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type
    weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    def engine_type_factory(ref, data_len):
        # Custom factory function to create PeriodIndex instances
        if ref is None:
            return None
        return self._engine_type(ref, data_len)
    
    return engine_type_factory(weak_period, len(self))
``` 

In the corrected version, we properly store the weak reference `weak_period` within the `_engine` function. We then use a factory function `engine_type_factory` to create instances of `_engine_type` with the weak reference and the data length. This approach ensures that the weak reference is accessible when creating the `_engine_type` instance.
