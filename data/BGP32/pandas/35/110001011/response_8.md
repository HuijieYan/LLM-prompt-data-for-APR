### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is an instance of `PeriodIndex`. This weak reference is then passed to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`. However, the issue lies in the fact that `period` is a local variable within the `_engine` method, so it will get garbage collected after the function call, leading to the weak reference being lost.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the weak reference `period` is being created as a local variable within the `_engine` function. As a local variable, `period` will get garbage collected after the function call, leading to the weak reference being lost. This behavior contradicts the purpose of using weak references, which is to avoid reference cycles and premature garbage collection. 

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the weak reference to `self` should be stored as an instance attribute within the `PeriodIndex` class to prevent it from getting garbage collected prematurely.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    """
    Immutable ndarray holding ordinal values indicating regular periods in time.
    
    Index keys are boxed to Period objects which carries the metadata (eg,
    frequency information).
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    data : array-like (1d int np.ndarray or PeriodArray), optional
        Optional period-like data to construct index with.
    copy : bool
        Make a copy of input ndarray.
    freq : str or period object, optional
        One of pandas period strings or corresponding objects.
    year : int, array, or Series, default None
    month : int, array, or Series, default None
    quarter : int, array, or Series, default None
    day : int, array, or Series, default None
    hour : int, array, or Series, default None
    minute : int, array, or Series, default None
    second : int, array, or Series, default None
    tz : object, default None
        Timezone for converting datetime64 data to Periods.
    dtype : str or PeriodDtype, default None

    Examples

    def __init__(self, data=None, copy=False, freq=None, year=None, month=None, quarter=None, day=None, hour=None, minute=None, second=None, tz=None, dtype=None):
        super().__init__(data=data, copy=copy, dtype=dtype)

        self.year = year
        self.month = month

    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, the weak reference `self._period_ref` is stored as an instance attribute within the `PeriodIndex` class to ensure that the reference is maintained throughout the object's lifetime. This change resolves the issue of prematurely losing the weak reference.
