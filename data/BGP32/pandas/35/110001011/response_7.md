### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`. The purpose is to avoid a reference cycle.
2. However, the issue described on GitHub points out that when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`, weakrefs are lost, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of `PeriodIndex`.
3. The bug seems to be related to weak referencing not behaving as expected when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`.
4. A potential fix could involve ensuring that weak references are maintained when copying `PeriodIndex` levels.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the loss of weak references when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`. When the weak reference is lost, the `PeriodEngine` receives `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

### Fix Strategy:
Alter the copying mechanism in a way that preserves weak references when copying `PeriodIndex` levels.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))

    def copy(self):
        # Create a new instance of PeriodIndex and copy weakref
        cls = self.__class__
        new_index = cls(self)
        
        # Maintain weak reference
        new_index._engine_type = self._engine_type

        # Return the new copied instance
        return new_index
``` 

In the corrected version, a new `copy` method is added to create a copy of the `PeriodIndex` instance while maintaining the weak reference during the copying process. This should address the issue described in the GitHub report.
