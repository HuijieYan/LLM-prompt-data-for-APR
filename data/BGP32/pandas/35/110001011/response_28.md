The bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class is related to weak referencing. The issue arises when a `PeriodIndex` object is initialized, and the `self` reference is stored weakly for later use within the `_engine_type` method. However, due to the weak reference usage, the `PeriodIndex` object can be garbage collected before it is actually used in `_engine_type`, leading to unexpected behaviors and errors.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `_engine` function to store a strong reference to `self` while passing a weak reference to `_engine_type`. This ensures that the `PeriodIndex` object is kept alive until it is used within the `_engine_type` method.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# Fix for the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = self
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(period), len(period))
```

By storing a strong reference to `self` in the `period` variable, we ensure that the `PeriodIndex` object is not garbage collected prematurely. This modification should resolve the weak referencing issue reported in the GitHub bug.

Please apply this fix to the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file in the `PeriodIndex` class.
