### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is part of the `PeriodIndex` class in `pandas/core/indexes/period.py`. It is using a `weakref` to store a weak reference to `self` before creating an instance of `_engine_type` using this reference. The issue reported on GitHub suggests that weak references are being lost, leading to unexpected behavior when accessing certain attributes.

### Error Location:
The bug appears to be related to how the weak reference is being handled within the `_engine` function.

### Bug Cause:
The weak reference to `self` is being assigned to the variable `period`, but it is not being used properly to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance. This may lead to the weak reference being lost before reaching the intended step in the `_engine_type` instantiation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly created and maintained until it is passed to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

In the corrected version, `period()` is called after creating the weak reference, ensuring that we obtain a strong reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance before passing it to `_engine_type`. This should resolve the issue with weak references being lost prematurely.
