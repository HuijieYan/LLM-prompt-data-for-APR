### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is supposed to return an instance of `_engine_type` by passing a weak reference of `self` (`PeriodIndex`) and the length of `self`.
2. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.
3. Based on the provided runtime values, the `self` parameter is a `PeriodIndex` with values `['2019Q1', '2019Q2']`, dtype `'period[Q-DEC]'`, and freq `'Q-DEC'`. The weak reference to `self` is created but not properly utilized, leading to the issue.

### Bug Cause:
The weak reference created in `_engine` function is not being used effectively; hence, when the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped prematurely, the `PeriodEngine` receives `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference of `self` (`PeriodIndex`) is maintained properly until it is utilized by the `PeriodEngine`. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference in a local variable instead of creating it within the `return` statement.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    def _engine(self):
        # Store a weak reference of self in a local variable to avoid premature dropping
        weak_self = weakref.ref(self)
        # Return the _engine_type object using the weakly referenced self and length of self
        return self._engine_type(weak_self, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference in a local variable, the corrected function ensures that the reference to `PeriodIndex` is maintained until it is used by the `_engine_type`, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
