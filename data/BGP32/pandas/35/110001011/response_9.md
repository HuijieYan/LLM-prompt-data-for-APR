### Analysis:
The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance. However, the weak reference is being stored in the `period` variable, but it is not being used correctly when initializing the `_engine_type`. This results in the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex` instance, causing issues when accessing the levels in a `MultiIndex`.

### Bug Cause:
The `weakref.ref(self)` creates a weak reference to `self` and assigns it to the `period` variable, but the weak reference is not being dereferenced before being passed to the `_engine_type` constructor. As a result, the `PeriodEngine` receives `None` instead of the original `PeriodIndex` instance, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to dereference the weak reference stored in the `period` variable before passing it to the `_engine_type` constructor. This will ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives the original `PeriodIndex` instance instead of `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Dereference the weak reference before passing it to _engine_type
        period = weakref.ref(self)()
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By making this change, the `PeriodEngine` will receive the correct `PeriodIndex` instance, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
