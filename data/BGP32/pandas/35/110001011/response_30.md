### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` method of the `PeriodIndex` class. It is designed to create an instance of `_engine_type` using a weak reference to `self` (which is an instance of `PeriodIndex`) to avoid reference cycles. However, the current implementation of `weakref.ref(self)` is incorrect and leads to the creation of a weak reference that loses the reference to `self`. This issue leads to the `_engine` function returning `None` instead of an instance of `_engine_type`.

### Bug Cause:
The primary cause of the bug is the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref(self)` within the `_engine` function. This incorrect usage results in losing the reference to `self`, causing the `_engine` function to return `None` instead of the expected `_engine_type` instance.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly create a weak reference to `self` within the `_engine` function so that it maintains the reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance. We can achieve this by modifying how the weak reference is created and accessed in the `_engine` function.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we ensure that the weak reference maintains a strong reference to `self` and does not lose it. This correction should resolve the issue and ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives the necessary `PeriodIndex` instance.
