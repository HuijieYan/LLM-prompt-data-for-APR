### Analysis:
1. The `PeriodIndex` class contains a `_engine` method that is expected to return an instance of the `_engine_type` class by passing a weak reference of itself as an argument to `_engine_type`. However, there is an issue with how the weak reference is being created and used.
2. The `weakref.ref()` function is used to create a weak reference to `self`, but the weak reference is not being correctly utilized when calling `_engine_type`.
3. The issue seems to be related to the reference cycle management and weak reference usage within the `PeriodIndex` class, leading to unexpected behavior when accessing the `_engine` method.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the weak reference to `self` is not properly retained when passed to `_engine_type`, leading to the weak reference being garbage collected prematurely, resulting in None being passed to `_engine_type`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` remains valid while passing it to `_engine_type`. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference to `self` in a class attribute to prevent it from being garbage collected too soon.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    if not hasattr(self, '_period_weakref'):
        self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
``` 

In the corrected version, a check is included to see if the weak reference has already been stored in a class attribute `_period_weakref`. If not, it stores the weak reference in `_period_weakref` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This ensures that the weak reference remains valid and prevents premature garbage collection.
