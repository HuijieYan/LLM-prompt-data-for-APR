### Analyze the buggy function:
The buggy function `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class is using a `weakref.ref` on `self` to avoid a reference cycle. However, the returned value is not being properly handled, causing issues with weak referencing.

### Identify potential error locations:
1. `period = weakref.ref(self)` is creating a weak reference to `self`.
2. `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))` is using the weak reference but not handling it correctly.

### Explain the cause of the bug:
The bug seems to stem from improper handling of the weak reference to `self`. When the weak reference is used in the return statement, it might not behave as expected, leading to the None value being passed to `self_engine_type`, causing unexpected behavior.

### Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is properly handled when used in the `_engine` function. It's important to maintain the reference to `self` properly to avoid any issues with weak referencing.

### Modified and Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, the weak reference is removed, and `self` is directly passed to `_engine_type`. By passing `self` directly, we ensure that the reference to `self` is maintained properly, resolving the weak referencing issue.
