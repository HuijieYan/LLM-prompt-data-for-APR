### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref` to create a weak reference to the `self` instance (a `PeriodIndex` object) and passing it to `_engine_type` along with the length of the `PeriodIndex`.
- The issue on GitHub indicates that copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` leads to weak refs being lost.
- The bug seems to be related to the weak reference handling, where the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before intended, resulting in `None` being passed to the `PeriodEngine`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by improper handling of weak references within the `_engine` function, where the weak reference to `self` is lost prematurely, causing `None` to be passed to `_engine_type`.

### Fix Strategy:
To address this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until it is successfully passed to `_engine_type`. We can achieve this by properly managing the weak reference within the `_engine` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Maintain a weak reference to self until it is passed to _engine_type
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

By maintaining the weak reference (`period_ref`) until it is used in the `return` statement, we ensure that the `PeriodIndex` instance is correctly preserved for use in `_engine_type`. This correction should resolve the issue reported on GitHub regarding weak references being lost when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`.
