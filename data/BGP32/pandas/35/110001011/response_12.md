### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is trying to create an instance of `_engine_type` by passing a weak reference of `self` (a `PeriodIndex` object) and the length of `self`. However, the weak reference is not being utilized correctly, leading to the issue described in the GitHub problem. The weak reference is not maintained properly, causing the `_engine_type` to receive `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

### Error Location:
The issue lies in how the weak reference is being handled in the `_engine` function.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the weak reference of `self` is not being stored properly to maintain its reference throughout the `_engine` function's lifecycle. As a result, by the time `_engine_type` is invoked with the weak reference, it has already been lost or garbage collected, leading to `None` being passed instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to properly store the weak reference to `self` so that it remains valid throughout the execution of the `_engine` function. We can achieve this by creating a class attribute to hold the weak reference and then correctly passing it to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version:

# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
@inherit_names(['strftime', 'to_timestamp', 'asfreq', 'start_time', 'end_time'] + PeriodArray._field_ops, PeriodArray, wrap=True)
@inherit_names(['is_leap_year', 'freq', '_format_native_types'], PeriodArray)

    # corrected version of the buggy function
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)

    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, a weak reference to `self` is stored in the attribute `_period_weakref` during the class initialization (`__init__` method). This weak reference is then correctly passed to `_engine_type` when creating an instance of the engine in the `_engine` function. This ensures that the reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained throughout the function's execution.
