### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is an instance of `PeriodIndex`.
2. The function is returning the result of calling `_engine_type` with the weak reference `period` and the length of `self`.
3. The GitHub issue specifies that there is a problem with weak references being dropped prematurely, leading to unexpected behavior when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on a `MultiIndex`.
4. The issue arises because the weak reference `period` is not being properly maintained, causing it to be dropped before intended.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` remains valid throughout the lifetime of the `PeriodIndex` instance.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the weak reference `period` is assigned within the `_engine` function but is not stored anywhere, which can lead to the weak reference being garbage collected prematurely.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to store the weak reference `period` as an attribute of the `PeriodIndex` instance to prevent it from being garbage collected prematurely.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference in an attribute to prevent premature garbage collection
    self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference as an attribute of the `PeriodIndex` instance, we ensure that the reference remains valid as long as the instance exists, addressing the premature dropping of weak references.
