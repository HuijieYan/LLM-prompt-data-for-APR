### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` attempts to create an engine instance using a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object. However, the weak reference is not being handled correctly, leading to the engine instance receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`, causing the bug.

### Error location:
The issue lies in the implementation of the weak reference using `weakref.ref(self)`. The weak reference needs to be stored correctly to ensure that it is accessible when creating the engine instance.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the weak reference to `self` is not stored properly, resulting in the engine instance not receiving the expected `PeriodIndex` object but instead receiving `None`.

### Fix strategy:
To resolve the bug, update the `_engine` function to correctly store the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object before creating the engine instance.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
# Corrected _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a weak reference to self for the engine instance
    self_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self_ref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference to `self` in a variable (`self_ref`) before creating the engine instance, we ensure that the engine receives the correct reference to the `PeriodIndex` object. This fix should address the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
