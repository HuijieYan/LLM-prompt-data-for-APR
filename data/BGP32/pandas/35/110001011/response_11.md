### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is utilizing `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance.
2. The buggy function returns an instance of `_engine_type` passing the weak reference `period` and the length of `self`.
3. Based on the GitHub issue, the problem arises when copying the levels on `MultiIndex`, causing the weakrefs to be lost.
4. The cause of the bug seems to be related to how the weak reference `period` is handled within the `_engine` function.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance is correctly maintained throughout the lifetime of the `_engine` function. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference in a class attribute to prevent it from getting deleted prematurely.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected version of the _engine function in the PeriodIndex class
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference to self in a class attribute to prevent premature deletion
    if not hasattr(self, '_period_ref'):
        self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
``` 

By storing the weak reference to `self` in the `_period_ref` attribute of the `PeriodIndex` instance, we ensure that the weak reference is not lost prematurely, thus fixing the bug identified in the GitHub issue.
