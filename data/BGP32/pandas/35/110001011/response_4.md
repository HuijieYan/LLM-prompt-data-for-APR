### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is intended to return an instance of the `_engine_type` class with a weak reference to the `self` object. However, the weak reference creation is incorrect, leading to potential issues when accessing the weakly referenced `self` object.

### Error Location:
The error is in the line:
```python
period = weakref.ref(self)
```
This line should create a weak reference to `self`, but instead, it creates a weak reference to a newly created local variable `period`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug causes the weak reference to reference the local variable `period` instead of the `self` object. This can lead to potential issues when the weak reference is accessed in the `_engine_type` class, as it will be referring to a local variable that is out of scope.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly create a weak reference to the `self` object, so that the `_engine_type` class can access it properly.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By making this change, the weak reference will correctly reference the `self` object, and the potential issues with the weak reference in the `_engine_type` class will be resolved.
