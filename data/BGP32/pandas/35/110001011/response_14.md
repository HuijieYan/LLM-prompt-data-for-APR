### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is intended to return an instance of `_engine_type` by passing a weak reference of `self` to it. However, the bug seems to be related to the weak reference not being maintained properly, leading to the `period` variable not being accessed correctly within the returned `_engine_type`.

### Potential Error Locations
1. The creation and handling of the weak reference `period`.
2. Passing the weak reference `period` to `_engine_type`.

### Bug Cause
The bug seems to be caused by the weak reference `period` not being maintained correctly. This results in the `period` variable becoming inaccessible or ineffective when passed to `_engine_type`. As a result, `_engine_type` receives `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex` object.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is correctly maintained throughout the function and properly passed to `_engine_type`. This involves handling the weak reference creation, access, and utilization properly to prevent it from becoming `None`.

### Corrected Version
```python
# Ensure to import necessary modules

class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    """
    Immutable ndarray holding ordinal values indicating regular periods in time.
    
    Index keys are boxed to Period objects which carries the metadata (eg,
    frequency information).
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    data : array-like (1d int np.ndarray or PeriodArray), optional
        Optional period-like data to construct index with.
    copy : bool
        Make a copy of input ndarray.
    freq : str or period object, optional
        One of pandas period strings or corresponding objects.
    year : int, array, or Series, default None
    month : int, array, or Series, default None
    quarter : int, array, or Series, default None
    day : int, array, or Series, default None
    hour : int, array, or Series, default None
    minute : int, array, or Series, default None
    second : int, array, or Series, default None
    tz : object, default None
        Timezone for converting datetime64 data to Periods.
    dtype : str or PeriodDtype, default None

    Examples

    def _engine(self):
        period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period_ref(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, the weak reference `period_ref` is created for `self`. This reference is then accessed with `period_ref()` when passed to `_engine_type`. This modification ensures that the weak reference is properly preserved and utilized, preventing it from resolving to `None`.
