### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` creates a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object, `self`, and then attempts to use it to initialize `_engine_type`. However, since `weakref.ref` returns a weak reference object, and not the actual object, it needs to be dereferenced to obtain the actual object before passing to `_engine_type`. This is the cause of the bug in the function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the weak reference object is being passed to `_engine_type` instead of the actual `PeriodIndex` object.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to dereference the weak reference to obtain the actual `PeriodIndex` object before passing it to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Dereference the weak reference to obtain the actual object
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    if period is None:
        raise RuntimeError("Weak reference no longer exists")
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By dereferencing the weak reference using `()` and adding a check for `None`, we ensure that the actual `PeriodIndex` object is passed to `_engine_type`. This corrected version should resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
