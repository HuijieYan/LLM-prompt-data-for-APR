### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` decorated function within the `PeriodIndex` class.
2. It aims to avoid a reference cycle by passing a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`. 
3. The current implementation uses `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference of `self`, but it is not correctly utilized.
4. The bug causes the weak reference `period` to be kept within the function scope, leading to a reference cycle issue.
5. The GitHub issue indicates the problem with weakrefs in MultiIndex levels, suggesting a similar root cause.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrectly creating and utilizing the weak reference within the `_engine` function. The weak reference `period` is scoped within the function, preventing the intended avoidance of reference cycles.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the issue, we need to correctly create and utilize the weak reference `period` in a way that avoids a reference cycle. We should ensure that the weak reference is accessible to `_engine_type` and does not cause a circular reference.

### Corrected Version:
```python
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

By modifying `period()` to invoke the weak reference, we can obtain a strong reference to `self` without causing a reference cycle. This corrected version resolves the issue by ensuring the weak reference is properly used in the `_engine` function.
