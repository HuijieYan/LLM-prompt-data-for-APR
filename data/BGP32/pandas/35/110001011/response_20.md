### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` function responsible for creating an engine instance based on the `self` PeriodIndex object.
2. The bug is related to a weak reference `period` created for the `self` object, but it is not correctly used when instantiating the engine.
3. The bug reported in the GitHub issue is due to the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped prematurely, causing the engine to receive `None`.
4. The strategy to fix the bug involves correctly utilizing the weak reference and ensuring it remains valid throughout the `_engine` function execution.

### Bug Fix:
```python
from pandas.core.indexes.period import PeriodEngine
import weakref

class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    # Existing code...
    
    # Fixing the buggy function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return PeriodEngine(period, len(self))
```

By using the `PeriodEngine` class (which should be appropriately imported) and passing the weak reference `period` to it, we ensure that the `PeriodIndex` object is still accessible during the engine instantiation, resolving the issue of receiving `None`.
