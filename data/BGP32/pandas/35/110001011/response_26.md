### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` returns an instance of `_engine_type` by passing a weak reference of `self` (a `PeriodIndex` object) as an argument. The issue arises from the weak reference not being stored correctly, leading to the `_engine_type` receiving `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

### Identified Issue:
The weak reference assignment `period = weakref.ref(self)` is assumed to create a weak reference to `self`, but it actually returns a weak reference object. When passed to `_engine_type`, it results in `None` being received instead of the actual `PeriodIndex` object.

### Fix Strategy:
Instead of directly storing the weak reference object, the `period` variable should be accessed by calling it (i.e., `period()`), which would return the actual `PeriodIndex` object.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

By accessing the weak reference object `period` with `period()`, we ensure that the actual `PeriodIndex` object is passed to `_engine_type`, thus resolving the issue.
