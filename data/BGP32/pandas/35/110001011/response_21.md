### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object.
2. The weak reference is then used to instantiate the `_engine_type` class, passing the weak reference and the length of the `PeriodIndex`.
3. The issue on GitHub indicates that weak references are being lost when copying `PeriodIndex` levels in a `MultiIndex`, causing errors due to obtaining `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.
4. The cause of the bug seems to be related to how weak references are handled or dropped prematurely during the execution of the function, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To address the issue related to weak references being lost, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained until its expected usage within the `_engine_type` instantiation. One approach to achieve this is to store the weak reference within an attribute of the `PeriodIndex` object, ensuring its validity throughout the execution of the function.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Store a weak reference to the PeriodIndex object
        setattr(self, '_period_weakref', weakref.ref(self))
        return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
``` 

In the corrected version, a weak reference to `self` (the `PeriodIndex` object) is stored in the `_period_weakref` attribute to maintain its reference until needed. This should address the issue of weak references being lost prematurely.
