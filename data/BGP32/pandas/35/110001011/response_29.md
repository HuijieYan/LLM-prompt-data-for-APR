### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` method in the `PeriodIndex` class. It returns an instance of `_engine_type` class initialized with a weak reference of `self` and the length of the `PeriodIndex` object. The purpose is to avoid a reference cycle.
   
2. The bug seems to stem from the implementation of weak referencing within the `_engine` function, where the weak reference to `self` is not properly maintained.

### Identified Error:
The error lies in the weak referencing implementation within the `_engine` function, potentially causing the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to be dropped before intended, leading to a `None` being passed to the `PeriodEngine`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained properly so that it does not get dropped unexpectedly. This can be achieved by modifying how the weak reference is created and used within the `_engine` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))  # use period() instead of period
``` 

By using `period()` instead of `period`, we ensure that the weak reference is properly resolved to the original object before being passed to the `_engine_type`. This correction should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
