### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`. The `weakref.ref` function is used to avoid reference cycles and potential memory leaks.

The root cause of the bug is that the weak reference `period` is assigned to the local variable `period`, but it's not being used correctly when passed to `_engine_type`. This leads to `_engine_type` receiving `None` instead of the expected `self`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly use the weak reference `period` when calling `_engine_type`. Instead of simply assigning `period` to a local variable, it should be dereferenced as `period()` before passing it to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By dereferencing the weak reference using `period()` before passing it to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the `self` reference is correctly passed to `_engine_type` and the bug causing the issue mentioned in the GitHub report is fixed.
