### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` function within the `PeriodIndex` class in pandas. It aims to create a weak reference to the `self` object and return an instance of `_engine_type` class using the weak reference and length of `self`.
   
2. The function aims to prevent reference cycles by passing a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`.
   
3. The bug reported in the GitHub issue "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs" indicates that weak references are being lost when copying `PeriodIndex` levels in a `MultiIndex` scenario. This behavior is caused by the `PeriodIndex` weak reference being dropped prematurely.

### Bug:
The bug occurs because the weak reference to `self` is being created inside the `_engine` function but not properly utilized. As a result, the weak reference is lost before it can be used, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the weak reference to `self` should be maintained until it is used within `_engine_type`. By ensuring that the weak reference is valid during the creation of the `PeriodEngine`, the bug related to lost weak references can be addressed.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))  # Ensure the weak reference is still alive
``` 

In the corrected version, `period()` is called immediately when passing it to `_engine_type`, ensuring that the weak reference is dereferenced properly and remains valid throughout the creation of the `PeriodEngine`. This fix should resolve the issue related to lost weak references in `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`.
