### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a cached readonly method that returns an instance of `_engine_type` by passing a weak reference of `self` (PeriodIndex object) to it.
2. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on a `MultiIndex`, weakrefs are being lost causing an error due to the PeriodEngine receiving `None` instead of the expected PeriodIndex.
3. The bug in the `_engine` function is likely causing the weak reference to be dropped prematurely, resulting in the issue observed in copying `PeriodIndex` levels on a `MultiIndex`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is maintained until it's no longer needed.

### Bug cause:
The bug is due to the premature dropping of the weak reference to the PeriodIndex object in the `_engine` method, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving `None` instead of the PeriodIndex instance.

### Fix strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex object is maintained throughout the `_engine` method's execution until it's no longer needed to avoid losing weakrefs.

### Corrected version of the `_engine` method:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    def get_engine(period, length):
        return self._engine_type(period, length)
    
    return get_engine(period, len(self))
```

By modifying the `_engine` method to create a nested function that retains the weak reference to the PeriodIndex object, we ensure that the weakref is not lost prematurely, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
