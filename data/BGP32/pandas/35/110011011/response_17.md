### Identify potential error locations within the buggy function
In the `_engine` function, the weak reference to `self` is being created but it seems that the use of `weakref.ref(self)` is not capturing the right reference. This results in `PeriodEngine` receiving a `NoneType` object instead of the actual `PeriodIndex` object.

### Explain the cause of the bug
The bug occurs because the weak reference created using `weakref.ref(self)` might not be effectively capturing the reference to the `self` object correctly, potentially leading to its premature deletion or being assigned incorrectly. This causes the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `NoneType`, triggering an AttributeError when attempting to access an attribute that does not exist on a `NoneType` object.

### Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug
To fix this bug, we should ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly maintained and utilized within the function and that it correctly captures the reference to the `PeriodIndex` object. This can involve handling the weak reference creation more robustly or using a different approach to avoid the premature deletion or wrong assignment of the reference.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `weakref.proxy(self)` is used instead of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference. This ensures that the `self` object's reference is maintained correctly and passed to `_engine_type`. This modification should help resolve the issue with weak references in the `PeriodIndex` class.
