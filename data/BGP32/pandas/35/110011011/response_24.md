### Identify potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The function `_engine` is using `self._engine_type` which is intended to create an instance of `PeriodEngine` class to work with `PeriodIndex` objects. However, there seems to be an issue with how `weakref` is being handled, causing the `AttributeError`.

### Explain the cause of the bug
The bug arises due to the weak referencing mechanism in the `_engine` function that does not handle the weak reference properly, resulting in `self._engine_type` receiving a None instead of the expected `PeriodIndex` object. This leads to the AttributeError when trying to get the `view("i8")` from the None object in `return super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter().view("i8")`.

### Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, ensure that the weak referencing of `PeriodIndex` object in the `_engine` function is done correctly to avoid the `NoneType` error during the attribute retrieval. This may involve modifying the weak referencing mechanism to maintain the reference until it is no longer needed.

### The corrected version of the function

```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    if period() is None:
        raise ValueError("Invalid reference to PeriodIndex object")
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By adding a check to ensure that the weak reference `period()` is not None before proceeding, we can prevent the AttributeError caused by accessing attributes on a None object. This modification will help in maintaining the reference integrity and avoid the issue highlighted in the failing test.
