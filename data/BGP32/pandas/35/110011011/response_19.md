### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is a `cache_readonly` function that aims to return the engine type based on the period array data.
- The error occurs when trying to access the `_engine` in the context of `is_monotonic_increasing`.
- The error message indicates that an `AttributeError` is raised because the `'NoneType'` object has no attribute `'view'`.
- The failing test involves creating a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` and checking whether all levels are monotonic. This test fails due to the mentioned error.
- The GitHub issue refers to a problem where weak references to `PeriodIndex` data are dropped prematurely, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` object.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the prematurely dropped weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object, resulting in the `_engine` being assigned a `None` object instead of the expected `PeriodIndex` instance.

### Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug, ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly maintained throughout the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class. This will prevent the `NoneType` object error when trying to access the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` data.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from pandas import PeriodEngine

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return PeriodEngine(period, len(self))
```

By maintaining the weak reference to `self` and using it to create the `PeriodEngine` instance, the corrected version of the `_engine` function should prevent the `NoneType` object error and resolve the failing test case.
