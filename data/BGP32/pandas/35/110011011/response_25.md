### 1. Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is returning `None` when accessed by the `is_monotonic` method in a different context. This leads to an `AttributeError` due to a missing `view` attribute.

### 2. Identified Bug Location
The bug is located in the `_engine` function where `period` is being set as a weak reference to `self`, but it's not being correctly utilized to create an engine.

### 3. Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is that the weak reference `period` is not being properly handled. When `_engine` is called, `self` is not retrievable from the weak reference `period`, causing the engine to be initialized incorrectly as `None`. This results in the subsequent `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute.

### 4. Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to fetch `self` correctly from the weak reference `period` inside the `_engine` function. This ensures that the engine is created with the correct reference to `self`.

### 5. Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By modifying the line `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))` to `return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))` in the `_engine` function, we correctly retrieve `self` from the weak reference `period`, ensuring the engine is initialized with the correct reference.
This fix should resolve the issue and pass the failing test related to `is_monotonic` in the `MultiIndex` context.
