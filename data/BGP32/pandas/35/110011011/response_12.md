### Analysis
The function `_engine` is supposed to return an instance of `_engine_type` with weakly referenced `self` (a `PeriodIndex`). However, the issue arises from the fact that the weak reference is not used correctly, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving a `NoneType` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This leads to the AttributeError when trying to access the attribute 'view'.

### Bug Location
The potential location of the bug is in how the weak reference `period` is being used inside the `_engine` function. 

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the weak reference `period` is not correctly utilized to refer to `self`. As a result, when the `_engine` function is called and attempts to access `period`, it gets a `NoneType` object instead of the expected `PeriodIndex` instance. This leads to the AttributeError when trying to access an attribute of a `NoneType` object.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the weak reference `period` should be utilized properly inside the `_engine` function to avoid the reference cycle issue. By correctly referencing `self` using a weak reference, the `_engine` function should be able to return the expected instance of `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass the weak reference to _engine_type.
    weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weak_period(), len(self))
```

This corrected version of the `_engine` function should resolve the issue by using the weak reference `weak_period` properly when creating the engine instance, ensuring that the `PeriodIndex` instance is correctly passed without causing a reference cycle.
