### Analysis
The `PeriodIndex._engine` function is designed to return an instance of `_engine_type` initialized with a weak reference to `self` (`PeriodIndex`). However, based on the error message and the provided runtime values, it seems that there is an issue when trying to access the `view` attribute of `NoneType`, indicating that the `_engine` attribute might not be set correctly, causing a reference issue.

### Explanation of the Bug
The bug occurs because the weak reference is not correctly set in the `_engine` function. Due to this issue, the `_engine` attribute is not being properly initialized with the intended `PeriodEngine` instance, leading to a `NoneType` error when trying to access the `view` attribute.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly implemented when initializing the `_engine` attribute. This will ensure that the `PeriodEngine` instance is properly associated with the `PeriodIndex`, preventing the `NoneType` error later on.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type
    return engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By accessing `self._engine_type` explicitly and returning the result of initializing `engine_type` with the weak reference and length of `self`, we ensure that the `_engine` attribute is correctly set with the desired `PeriodEngine` instance.

This fix resolves the reference issue and should prevent the `NoneType` error, allowing the tests to pass successfully.
