### Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The function is supposed to return an instance of `PeriodEngine` constructed using a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object. However, due to incorrect weak reference handling, the `PeriodEngine` is receiving a `NoneType` instead of the actual `PeriodIndex` object, leading to the `AttributeError` during further processing.

### Error Cause
The bug arises because the weak reference to `self` is not being correctly used to create the `period` variable. Instead of passing the weak reference to `_engine_type`, the actual `self` object is being passed, leading to the `NoneType` error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to pass the weak reference `period` to the `_engine_type` constructor instead of the direct reference to `self`. This will ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex` object.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By making this change, the function now correctly passes the weak reference `period` to the `_engine_type` constructor, resolving the bug and preventing the `NoneType` error.
