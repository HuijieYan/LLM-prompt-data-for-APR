### Analysis
The bug seems related to weak referencing the `PeriodIndex` instance in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The error message suggests that the `PeriodEngine` receives a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

### Bug Cause
The bug seems to arise from not maintaining the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance correctly. When the `PeriodEngine` tries to access the weakly referenced object, it receives a `None`, leading to an `AttributeError`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance is maintained correctly and accessed by the `PeriodEngine` without any issues.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version:
1. `period()` is called to get the referenced object from the weak reference before passing it to the `_engine_type`.
2. This guarantees that the `PeriodEngine` receives a valid `PeriodIndex` instance instead of a `None`.

This correction should resolve the issue and pass the failing test related to weak referencing in the `PeriodIndex` class.
