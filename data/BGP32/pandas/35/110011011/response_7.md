### Analysis
The error occurs when the `is_monotonic` property is accessed for a `PeriodEngine` object, resulting in an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`. This error indicates that somewhere in the `_engine` method of `PeriodIndex` class, the `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))` statement is returning a `None` object instead of the expected `PeriodEngine` object.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect return of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` inside the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class. The weak reference `period` is not being used correctly, leading to a reference cycle issue and the `_engine_type` function returning `None` instead of the desired `PeriodEngine` object.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure the weak reference `period` is utilized correctly to prevent a reference cycle issue. We should improve the handling of the weak reference within the `_engine` method to ensure that a valid `PeriodEngine` object is returned.

### Corrected Version
```python
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
        return engine() if engine is not None else None
```

By modifying the `_engine` method as above, we ensure that the weakly referenced `self` is correctly passed to `_engine_type` without causing a reference cycle issue. Additionally, by checking if the `engine` object is not `None`, we prevent the error arising from trying to access attributes on a `NoneType` object. This correction should resolve the error and allow the test case to pass successfully.
