### Analyzing the bug

1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, where `self._engine_type` is supposed to receive a weak reference to `self`. However, in the implementation, a weak reference is not correctly passed, leading to an AttributeError after a chain of operations related to monotonic checks in the following test involving `MultiIndex`.

2. The error message suggests that a `NoneType` object has no attribute `view`, indicating that the expected weak reference for `PeriodEngine` is not properly set up.

3. The failing test initializes a `PeriodIndex` with periods '2019Q1' and '2019Q2', creates a `MultiIndex` based on it, and then checks if the levels of the `MultiIndex` are monotonic. 

### Bug's root cause

The bug arises because the weak reference passed to `_engine_type` in the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class is not correctly set. This leads to invalid operations and triggers an AttributeError at the point of checking the monotonicity.

### Suggested Fix

To address this bug, the `_engine` function should correctly establish the weak reference to `self` before instantiating the `PeriodEngine` within the `PeriodIndex` class.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Correctly establish a weak reference for self before instantiating PeriodEngine.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self), len(self), len(self))
``` 

In the updated version, `period` correctly contains the weak reference to `self`, ensuring that the intended reference handling is maintained, resolving the AttributeError.
