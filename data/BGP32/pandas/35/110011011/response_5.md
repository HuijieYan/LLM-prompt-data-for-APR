### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is trying to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance, but it is not correctly handling the weak reference, leading to an `AttributeError` when trying to access the weakly referenced object.

The issue seems to be related to the weak reference usage and potential reference cycle, leading to the `NoneType` error.

### Bug Cause
The weak reference creation is not done correctly in the `_engine` function. When trying to access the weak reference later in the `_engine_type`, it is returning a `NoneType` object.

The bug occurs in the weak reference creation using `weakref.ref(self)` where there might be a premature deletion of the weakly referenced object.

### Strategy for Fixing
To fix this bug, ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance is correctly created and maintained throughout the `_engine` method. The weak reference should persist as long as it is needed to avoid the reference cycle issue.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)  # Create a weak reference to the PeriodIndex instance
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

By creating a separate variable `period_ref` holding the weak reference, we ensure that the weakly referenced object will not be prematurely deleted, resolving the `NoneType` error.

This corrected version should address the issue reported on GitHub and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
