### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is creating a weak reference to `self`, but due to how the `_engine_type` is created and used, the weak reference is not being maintained correctly, resulting in a `NoneType` error when trying to access an attribute of the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex`.

### Bug Cause
The `_engine_type` initialization consumes the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` parameter and requires it to stay alive. However, the weak reference's target is lost before use, resulting in a `NoneType` object when accessing attributes on the weakly referenced object.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the weak reference to `self` in the `_engine` function needs to be maintained throughout its lifetime. One way to achieve this is by storing the weak reference to `self` as an instance variable within the `PeriodIndex` class, ensuring that the weak reference persists as long as the `PeriodIndex` object exists.

### Code Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class that maintains the weak reference properly:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference to `self` as `self._period_ref`, we ensure that the weak reference stays alive for the duration needed by the `_engine_type`, resolving the issue.
