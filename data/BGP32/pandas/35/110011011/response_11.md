### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is intended to return an engine type based on the provided `self` object. However, due to the usage of `weakref.ref()`, the reference to `self` may not be maintained as intended, resulting in a `NoneType` error when accessing attributes of the engine.

### Bug Explanation
The cause of the bug lies in the weak reference usage within the `_engine` function. When `weakref.ref(self)` is stored in `period`, the reference to `period` may not be valid when accessing `self` attributes later on in the `_engine_type`. This leads to a `NoneType` error when trying to access attributes of `self`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, one approach is to modify the `_engine` function to directly pass `self` to the `_engine_type` constructor instead of using a weak reference. This way, the reference to `self` will be maintained appropriately.

### Corrected Version
```python
    def _engine(self):
        return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By directly passing `self` to the `_engine_type` constructor, we ensure that the reference to `self` remains valid throughout the engine's operations. This corrected version should resolve the `NoneType` error caused by the weak reference issue.

This fix aligns with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue, ensuring that weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` objects are maintained correctly when creating the `PeriodEngine`.
