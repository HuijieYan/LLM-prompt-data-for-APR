### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is used to create an `engine_type` with a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object. This function is causing an error when `is_monotonic` is called on the `PeriodIndex` object. The error seems to be related to a `NoneType` object not having an attribute `view`.
   
2. The issue reported on GitHub suggests that weak references are being dropped prematurely, leading to the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` object instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

### Bug Cause:
The `_engine` method should return an instance of `PeriodEngine`, but due to a premature dropping of weak references, it might not get the expected `PeriodIndex` object, leading to a `NoneType` causing an attribute error.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we will ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained correctly until the `PeriodEngine` object is created.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        engine_type = self._engine_type
        return engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By maintaining a reference to `engine_type` even after creating the weak reference to `self`, we ensure that the instance of `PeriodEngine` is created correctly with the `PeriodIndex` object.

This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the tests pass without any errors.
