### Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The `_engine` function is supposed to return an instance of `_engine_type` with the weak reference of `self` passed to it. However, due to the usage of `weakref.ref(self)`, the weak reference itself (`period`) is stored as local variable without retaining it anywhere, leading to premature garbage collection and a `NoneType` error.

### Potential Error Location
The issue is in how the `weakref.ref(self)` return value is handled in the `_engine` function, where the weak reference is created but not maintained.

### Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug lies in the premature garbage collection of the weak reference created inside the `_engine` function. As a result, when `_engine_type` tries to access the weakly referenced `self`, it receives a `NoneType` object instead of the expected `PeriodIndex` object, leading to the AttributeError.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the weak reference should be maintained or stored in a way that prevents it from being garbage collected prematurely. This can be achieved by assigning the weak reference to `self._period_weakref` in the `PeriodIndex` class to keep it in scope.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
# Corrected _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference in `self._period_weakref`, the issue of premature garbage collection is resolved, allowing `_engine_type` to access the `PeriodIndex` object correctly.
