### Analysis
The `PeriodIndex` class has a `_engine` method that is intended to return an instance of the `_engine_type` class, passing a weak reference of the `PeriodIndex` instance to avoid reference cycles. The error occurs because the weak reference to `self` is not correctly being passed to the `_engine_type` class, leading to a `NoneType` object being accessed and resulting in an `AttributeError`.

The failing test shows that when trying to check if the levels of the `MultiIndex` are monotonic, the `self._engine.is_monotonic_increasing` call raises an `AttributeError` due to a `NoneType` object trying to access an attribute.

### Error Location
The issue lies in how the weak reference is assigned and passed to the `_engine_type`.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by not correctly passing the weak reference to `self` to the `_engine_type`.

### Suggested Fix Strategy
Ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly passed to the `_engine_type` by updating the assignment to `period` in the `_engine` method.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self), dtype='int64')  # Passing the weak reference and length correctly
``` 

This corrected version explicitly includes the correct parameters when calling `_engine_type`, fixing the bug related to weak referencing.
