### Analysis
- The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is trying to create an instance of `_engine_type` by passing a weak reference to `self`, but it is not handling the weak reference correctly.
- The error occurs when trying to access the attribute `view` on a `NoneType` object, indicating that the weak reference to `self` is not functioning as expected.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the weak reference `period` being assigned the result of `weakref.ref(self)` without properly accessing the referenced object when creating the `_engine_type` instance. This leads to the `PeriodEngine` instance internally having a weak reference to `None` instead of the actual `PeriodIndex` object.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to properly dereference the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type` to ensure that the `PeriodEngine` instance has an actual reference to the `PeriodIndex` object.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Dereference the weak reference to ensure _engine_type receives the actual object
    period = self if isinstance(self, weakref.ReferenceType) else weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By directly checking whether `self` is already a weak reference, we effectively handle the weak referencing correctly and ensure that the `PeriodEngine` instance receives the actual `PeriodIndex` object.

This correction should resolve the bug and allow the test case to pass successfully.
