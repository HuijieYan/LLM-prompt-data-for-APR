### Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_engine` property of the `PeriodIndex` class. The bug is resulting in a `NoneType` attribute error when attempting to access `view("i8")` due to the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of an actual `PeriodIndex` object.

### Error Cause
The `weakref.ref(self)` creates a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object but does not maintain its reference, leading to it being garbage collected. This causes the `_engine` property to return `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex` object.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to maintain a strong reference to the `PeriodIndex` object. One way to do this is by storing the reference to `self` in a class attribute to prevent it from being garbage collected.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a reference to self in a class attribute
    self._ref = self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
