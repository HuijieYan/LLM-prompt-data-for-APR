### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class creates a weak reference `period` to the `self` object, which is an instance of `PeriodIndex`. This weak reference is passed to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`.
2. The error occurs when trying to access `view("i8")` on the `super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter()` instance inside the `is_monotonic_increasing` method.
3. The issue is related to dropping the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` before intended, resulting in `None` being passed to the `PeriodEngine`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` remains valid throughout the `_engine` method execution.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
Since the issue is with the weak reference being dropped prematurely, we need to address how the weak reference `period` is maintained. We can modify the code to create the weak reference outside the `cache_readonly` decorator, ensuring its availability throughout the method execution.

### Corrected Function:
```python
    @property
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
    
        # Check if the period is still available before using it
        if period() is None:
            raise RuntimeError("Weak reference to PeriodIndex object is None")
    
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By ensuring the weak reference `period` remains valid within the `_engine` property, we alleviate the issue of the `NoneType` error caused by premature dropping of the weak reference. This correction should resolve the failing test related to the `is_monotonic` check in the `MultiIndex` scenarios.
