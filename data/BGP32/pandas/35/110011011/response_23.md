Based on the runtime values and types provided, the issue seems to arise from the `_engine_type` trying to access the `PeriodEngine` using a weak reference that turns into `None`, leading to the AttributeError at `return super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter().view("i8")`.

To rectify this, one strategy could be to ensure that the weak reference is maintained correctly throughout the `_engine_type` processing. By modifying the `_engine` function to handle this weak reference retrieval carefully, we can address the bug.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if period() is not None:
        return engine_type
    else:
        raise RuntimeError('Weak reference self is no longer available.')
``` 

By incorporating the check for the weak reference before returning `engine_type`, we ensure that the weak reference `period` is still valid. If it is invalid (i.e., `None`), a RuntimeError will be raised alerting about this scenario.

This correction should help address the bug encountered in the failing test scenario and align with the expected behavior as described in the GitHub issue.
