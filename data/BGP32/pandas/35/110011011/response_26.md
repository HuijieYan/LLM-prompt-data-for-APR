## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using a weak reference to `self` to avoid a reference cycle.
2. The error occurs during the `is_monotonic` check, specifically when accessing the `_engine` attribute, resulting in an `AttributeError` due to a `NoneType` object not having the `view` attribute.
3. The bug relates to weak references handling in `PeriodEngine` and is reflected in failing tests related to multi-index levels and weak references dropping prematurely.
4. The bug can be resolved by ensuring that the `_engine` attribute in the `PeriodIndex` class correctly retains the weak reference to `self`.

## Suggested Fix:
To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should maintain the weak reference appropriately and ensure that the `PeriodEngine` class receives a valid reference to `self`. Here is the corrected version of the function:

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` instead of just `period`, the weak reference is dereferenced correctly, providing a valid reference when constructing the `PeriodEngine` object. This fix should resolve the issue reported in the failing test.
