### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class is returning an object of type `PeriodEngine` but is not properly handling the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object. This leads to an `AttributeError` due to a `NoneType` object being encountered instead of the expected object.

The error occurs when trying to access the `view("i8")` method on a `NoneType` object, which causes the AttributeError.

### Potential Error Locations
The issue is in the `_engine` function where a weak reference is not correctly handled, leading to the creation of a `PeriodEngine` with potentially invalid data.

### Bug Cause
The `_engine` method should correctly handle the weak reference to `self` to avoid reference cycles and ensure that the `PeriodEngine` object is created with the correct instance of `PeriodIndex`. Currently, it seems that the weak reference is not being handled properly, resulting in a `NoneType` object being passed in place of the expected `PeriodIndex` object.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object needs to be maintained correctly within the `_engine` method. Ensure that the `weakref` object is accessed properly to obtain the actual `PeriodIndex` instance before creating the `PeriodEngine` object. This will prevent the `NoneType` object issue and should resolve the `AttributeError`.

### Corrected Version
```python
# Updated _engine function to correctly handle the weak reference
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By adding `()` after `weakref.ref(self)`, the correct instance of `PeriodIndex` is obtained from the weak reference object. This change ensures that the `PeriodEngine` object is created with the valid `PeriodIndex` instance, fixing the bug.
