### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is utilizing weak reference incorrectly, leading to the error message related to the `PeriodEngine` when trying to access `is_monotonic_increasing`.
2. The issue arises from the fact that the weak reference `period` is not being used properly within the `_engine` function.
3. The error occurs because when calling `self._engine_type(...)`, it is receiving a `NoneType` object instead of the expected `PeriodIndex` instance due to the weak reference not being used correctly, resulting in an `AttributeError`.
4. To fix this bug, the weak reference `period` needs to be properly utilized to prevent the object cycle issue that arises with the weak references. Ensuring that the reference is correctly passed to `_engine_type` will resolve the `NoneType` error.

### Bug-fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `_engine` function to properly use weak references when passing `self` to `_engine_type`.
2. Ensure that the weak reference maintains a reference to `self` to prevent it from being garbage collected prematurely.
3. Update the implementation such that the `PeriodIndex` object is successfully passed to the `PeriodEngine` without resulting in a `NoneType` error.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Correctly use weak reference to avoid a reference cycle issue
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

By correctly invoking `period()` in the return statement, the weak reference will be used to retrieve the actual `PeriodIndex` instance for passing to `_engine_type`, resolving the issue of receiving a `NoneType`.
