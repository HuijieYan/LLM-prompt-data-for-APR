### Bug Analysis
The bug lies in the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class. The function is returning `None`, leading to an `AttributeError` when trying to access `view("i8")` on a `NoneType` object.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference is not being used correctly, causing the `period` variable not to hold the reference to `self` properly. This issue arises from dropping the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` instance prematurely, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex` it expects.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the weak reference usage needs to be corrected. The weak reference should be established properly so that it maintains a reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance within the `_engine` function.

### Corrected Version
```python
# Updated version of the `_engine` function to resolve the bug
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

By correctly using `weakref.ref(self)` and using `period_ref` as the reference within the `_engine` function, the bug should be fixed, and the failing test should pass successfully.
