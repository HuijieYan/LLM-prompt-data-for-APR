### Error Analysis
- The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is expected to return an instance of `PeriodEngine` but the error indicates that a `NoneType` is returned instead, causing an `AttributeError`.
- The error occurs when trying to access the `view` attribute of the returned object, which is `None`.

### Bug Cause
- The bug occurs due to the weak reference usage in caching the engine which leads to the deallocation of the original `PeriodIndex` object before being utilized by the `PeriodEngine`.

### Suggested Fix Strategy
- Instead of using weak references, consider creating a strong reference to pass to the `_engine_type` constructor. This would ensure the `PeriodIndex` object is not deallocated prematurely.
- Modify the `_engine` function to appropriately handle the reference passing.

### Corrected Version
```python
    def _engine(self):
        # Pass a strong reference of self to _engine_type.
        return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

With this correction, the engine will now be initialized with a strong reference to the `PeriodIndex` object, preventing premature deallocation and resolving the `AttributeError`.
