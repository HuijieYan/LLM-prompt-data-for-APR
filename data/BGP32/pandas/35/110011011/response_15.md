### Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. It seems that the weak reference created for `self` is not being correctly utilized, leading to a `NoneType` error when trying to get the view of the index values.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by incorrectly creating a weak reference to the `self` object and not handling it properly in the `_engine` function. This results in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `NoneType` object instead of the `PeriodIndex`, leading to the `AttributeError`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the weak reference needs to be properly utilized in the `_engine` function to ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives the correct reference to the `PeriodIndex`.

### Corrected Version
```python
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weak reference of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        engine_instance = self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
        return engine_instance
```

This corrected version stores the weak reference to `self` in the `period` variable. Then, it calls `period()` to retrieve the stored `PeriodIndex` object from the weak reference when creating the `engine_instance`.

By utilizing the weak reference correctly, this fix ensures that the `PeriodEngine` receives the valid reference to the `PeriodIndex`, resolving the `NoneType` error and fixing the bug.
