### Analysis:
The error is likely occurring due to the `_engine` function returning `None` instead of the expected `PeriodEngine` object, causing an AttributeError when trying to access the `view()` method on a `NoneType` object.

### Error Location:
The issue seems to be within the `_engine` function where a `weakref.ref(self)` is being stored in `period`, but this weak reference is not being correctly used in creating the `_engine_type` object.

### Bug Cause:
The `period` weak reference is not being dereferenced correctly to retrieve the object it references before passing it to `_engine_type`. As a result, `None` is being passed instead of the actual `PeriodIndex` object.

### Fix Strategy:
The bug can be fixed by correctly dereferencing the weak reference `period` when creating the `_engine_type` object to ensure the actual `PeriodIndex` object is passed.

### Updated Version of the Function:
```python
# Updated _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
