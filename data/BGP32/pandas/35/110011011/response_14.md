### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` uses `weakref.ref(self)` to avoid reference cycles but returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. The error indicates an attribute error for a NoneType object due to a missing reference.
2. The error occurs when accessing `is_monotonic` for `x` in `idx2.levels`, indicating a problem in handling the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex`.
3. The function fails to properly maintain the weak reference to `self`, causing it to be dropped prematurely, leading to an attribute error.
4. To fix the bug, ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly maintained throughout the function to prevent premature destruction.

### Bug Fix:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)

    def get_engine(period_obj, length):
        if period_obj() is not None:  # Check if weakref is still alive
            return self._engine_type(period_obj, length)

    return get_engine(period, len(self))
``` 

By modifying the `_engine` function with the above code, we ensure that the weak reference to `self` is checked for validity before creating the engine instance, preventing the attribute error seen in the failing test.
