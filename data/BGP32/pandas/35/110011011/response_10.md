### Identify potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The `_engine` function is utilizing weakref to create a weak reference of `self` which is being passed to `_engine_type`. The issue might be occurring due to the improper handling of weak references.
2. The error message states that `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, indicating that the `_engine` function is returning `None` instead of the expected value which leads to the AttributeError.

### Explain the cause of the bug
The bug is likely caused by the weak reference approach utilized in the `_engine` function. The weak reference created for `self` might not be maintained correctly, causing it to be dropped prematurely. As a result, when `_engine_type` is called with the weak reference, it receives `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex` object, leading to the `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error.

### Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug
To fix this bug, it is necessary to ensure that the weak reference of `self` is maintained properly and not prematurely dropped. This can be achieved by ensuring that the weak reference object retains the reference to `self` throughout its usage within the `_engine` function.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)  # Create a weak reference to self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if period() is not None else None  # Check if the weak reference is still valid before creating engine
```

In the corrected version, before using the weak reference to create the engine, it checks if the weak reference is still valid (`period() is not None`). If it is valid, the engine is created with the weak reference; otherwise, `None` is returned. This ensures that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until it is no longer needed.
