### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine(self)` is attempting to create a weak reference to `self` (a `PeriodIndex` object) and initialize a new instance of `self._engine_type` with the weak reference.
2. The error occurs in the line `return super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter().view("i8")` which indicates that the engine is not properly initialized and is resulting in a `NoneType` error.
3. The failing test case is related to copying `PeriodIndex` levels on a `MultiIndex`, where weak references are not maintained as expected causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` object.
4. The bug can be fixed by ensuring that the weak reference is maintained properly throughout the engine's usage.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by dropping the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object prematurely, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `NoneType` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex` object.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object should be stored in the `PeriodEngine` instance, ensuring that the reference is not lost before the engine is utilized.

### Corrected Version
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self), self)
```

By passing the weak reference `period` along with the length and `self` to the `_engine_type` constructor, the weak reference will be maintained throughout the usage of the engine. This modification should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the engine receives a valid `PeriodIndex` object.
