### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to itself before passing it to `_engine_type`. This is done to avoid creating a reference cycle. However, the issue lies in the usage of `weakref.ref(self)`, which returns a weak reference object instead of the actual object itself.

### Bug
The bug is caused by passing a weak reference object instead of the actual `self` object to `_engine_type`, leading to errors in further processing.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we should pass the actual `self` object to `_engine_type` instead of the weak reference object created by `weakref.ref(self)`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
