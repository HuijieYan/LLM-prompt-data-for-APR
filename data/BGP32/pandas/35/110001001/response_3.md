### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` method defined in the `PeriodIndex` class. It seems to be intended to create an engine instance using `_engine_type` and a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance.

However, the problem lies in the implementation of creating a weak reference to `self` inside the function. The weak reference is not being created correctly, which can lead to memory leaks or unexpected behavior due to potential reference cycles.

### Bug explanation
The current implementation of creating a weak reference to `self` using `weakref.ref(self)` is not correct. It should be creating a weak reference to the actual object `self`, but instead, it is creating a weak reference to the class method, causing unexpected behavior.

### Fix strategy
To fix the bug, the weak reference should be created correctly to reference the `PeriodIndex` instance. This can be achieved by directly creating a weak reference to `self` without calling `weakref.ref`. 

### Corrected version of the function
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In this corrected version, the weak reference is created as `weakref.ref(self)` without any additional modifications, ensuring it references the `PeriodIndex` instance.
