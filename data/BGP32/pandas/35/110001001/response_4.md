### Cause of the bug:
The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is attempting to create a weak reference to the `self` object, but due to incorrect syntax, it is creating a weak reference to the variable `self` itself rather than the object it references. This causes the weak reference to be invalid and results in a bug.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly create a weak reference to the `self` object in the `_engine` function.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self._data)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

In the corrected version, we create a weak reference to the `self._data` object, which is the correct way to create a weak reference to the `self` object in the `PeriodIndex` class.
