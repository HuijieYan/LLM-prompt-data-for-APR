### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object, but it is then returning the actual `self` object instead of the weak reference. This can lead to potential reference cycle issues and is likely not the intended behavior.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by returning `self` instead of the weak reference created using `weakref.ref(self)`.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we should return the weak reference created by `weakref.ref(self)` instead of `self`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
