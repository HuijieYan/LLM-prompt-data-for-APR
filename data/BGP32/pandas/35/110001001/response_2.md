### Analysis
The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to itself in order to avoid reference cycles. However, the return statement is not accessing the actual `PeriodIndex` object from the weak reference, which is likely causing the bug.

### Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by the return statement not dereferencing the weak reference properly to access the `PeriodIndex` object.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to properly access the `PeriodIndex` object from the weak reference `period` in the return statement. Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` with parentheses, we are dereferencing the weak reference to get the actual `PeriodIndex` object before passing it to `_engine_type`. This should fix the bug and ensure that the engine type is properly initialized with the `PeriodIndex` object.
