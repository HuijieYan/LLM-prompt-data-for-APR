### Explanation of the bug
The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is attempting to create a weak reference to itself (`self`) to avoid a reference cycle. However, it is incorrectly using `weakref.ref(self)` directly as a parameter to `_engine_type`, which is causing the weak reference not to be maintained as expected. This is leading to potential reference cycle issues and incorrect behavior.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To properly create a weak reference to `self` and prevent any reference cycle issues, the correct approach would be to use a lambda function to create the weak reference. This lambda function will store `self` in a variable that won't interfere with the weak reference mechanism.

### Corrected version of the function
Here is a corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, use a lambda function to create a weak reference
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(lambda: period_ref(), len(self))
``` 

In this corrected version, the lambda function captures the weak reference to `self`, which is then used safely as a parameter to `_engine_type`, ensuring that the weak reference mechanism works as intended.
