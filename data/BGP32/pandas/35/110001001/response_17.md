### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is attempting to create an instance of `_engine_type` using a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object. However, the weak referencing is not implemented correctly, leading to potential reference cycle issues.

### Bug Explanation
The bug stems from the line `period = weakref.ref(self)`, where `self` is the `PeriodIndex` object. By calling `weakref.ref(self)`, `period` is assigned a weak reference to `self`, but this assignment is not being used correctly when creating `_engine_type`. Instead, `self` should be directly passed to `_engine_type` to avoid potential reference cycles.

### Bug Fix
Remove the line `period = weakref.ref(self)` and directly pass `self` to `_engine_type` when creating the instance.

### Corrected Version
```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
