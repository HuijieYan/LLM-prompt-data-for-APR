The bug in the `_engine` function lies in the way the `weakref.ref(self)` is being used. The purpose of using a weak reference is to prevent a reference cycle, but the current implementation is not correctly achieving that goal.

The `weakref.ref(self)` call creates a weak reference to the `self` object, but it is not being properly utilized in the subsequent `_engine_type` call. The weak reference needs to be dereferenced before passing it to `_engine_type`.

To fix the bug, we need to dereference the weak reference `period` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This can be done by calling `period()` to obtain the referenced object.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

By dereferencing the weak reference `period` before passing it to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the reference cycle is avoided and the function operates correctly.
