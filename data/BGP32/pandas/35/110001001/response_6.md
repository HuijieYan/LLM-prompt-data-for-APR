### Analysis
The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is attempting to create an instance of `_engine_type` by passing a weak reference of `self` and the length of the `PeriodIndex` object. However, the weak reference is not being utilized correctly.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because `weakref.ref(self)` is not being used appropriately to create a weak reference to `self`.

### Fix
To fix the bug, you should use the weak reference correctly. Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period_weakref(), len(self))
```

By calling `period_weakref()` instead of `period`, you correctly use the weak reference to access the `self` object.
