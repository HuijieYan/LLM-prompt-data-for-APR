### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is a `PeriodIndex` object. The intention is to avoid reference cycles and potential memory leaks. However, in this case, the `weakref.ref(self)` is not being used correctly.

### Bug Explanation
The bug lies in how the weak reference is being stored. Instead of assigning `weakref.ref(self)` to `period`, it should be assigned to `self._period_ref` or a similar attribute. This mistake leads to the weak reference being lost immediately after it is created, resulting in an invalid reference assignment when constructing `_engine_type`.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to store the weak reference correctly so that it remains accessible during the construction of `_engine_type`. Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference correctly
    self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference in an attribute like `self._period_ref`, we ensure that the reference remains valid until `_engine_type` is constructed.
