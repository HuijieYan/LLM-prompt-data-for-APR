### Explanation of the bug

The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref` incorrectly. It is trying to create a weak reference to `self` but not effectively maintaining it. This can lead to `self` being garbage collected before the function is finished executing, causing unexpected behavior.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to correctly use `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self` and ensure that it remains available while the function executes.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
# Corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Correctly create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    # Get the weak reference object itself
    period_ref = period()
    
    # Check if the weak reference still exists
    if period_ref is not None:
        return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
    
    # Return None if the weak reference no longer exists
    return None
``` 

In the corrected version, we first create a weak reference to `self` using `weakref.ref`. Then, we extract the weak reference object using `()` to ensure it exists. We check if the weak reference exists and use it to create the `_engine_type` if it does. We return `None` if the weak reference is no longer available. This approach ensures that we maintain a valid reference to `self` throughout the function execution.
