### Analysis
The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object and then instantiating an `_engine_type` object with that weak reference and the length of the `self` object.

### Potential Error
The potential error lies in how the weak reference `period` is being used. Since the weak reference `period` is stored locally within the `_engine` method, it might get garbage collected before it is accessed by the `_engine_type` object.

### Bug Cause
The weak reference `period` is not stored in a place where it is guaranteed to persist as long as the `_engine_type` object needs it. When the `_engine_type` object attempts to access the weak reference, it might have been already garbage collected, resulting in unexpected behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, store the weak reference in an instance variable of the `PeriodIndex` class so that it remains alive as long as the `PeriodIndex` object is alive and accessible.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference in an instance variable to ensure its persistence
    self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```
