### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object. However, the `weakref.ref()` function returns a weak reference object, not the actual object itself. This causes an issue when trying to create the `_engine_type` object with the weak reference.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by incorrectly using `weakref.ref(self)` instead of `weakref.proxy(self)` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object.

### Fix
Change `weakref.ref(self)` to `weakref.proxy(self)` in the `_engine` function.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
