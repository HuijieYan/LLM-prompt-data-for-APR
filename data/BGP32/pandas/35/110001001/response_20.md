### Explanation:
The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is using a `cache_readonly` decorator, which is intended to cache the result of the function to improve performance. However, in the given implementation, the function is returning a reference to the `self` object using `weakref`, which might lead to unexpected behavior due to circular references and memory management issues.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of `weakref` in the `_engine` function. The intention of using `weakref` is to create a weak reference to the `self` object to avoid strong reference cycles, but it is not being used correctly in this context, potentially leading to errors in memory management.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix this bug and ensure proper memory management, the usage of `weakref` in the `_engine` function can be revised. Instead of returning a reference to the `self` object using `weakref`, the `_engine` function should directly instantiate the `_engine_type` object with the necessary parameters.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
