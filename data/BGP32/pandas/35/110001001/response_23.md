### Problem Identification
The buggy function `_engine` is trying to create an instance of `_engine_type` by passing a weak reference of `self` (a `PeriodIndex` object) and the length of `self`. However, it does not handle weak references correctly, leading to potential reference cycle issues.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because `weakref.ref(self)` creates a weak reference to `self`, but when the weak reference `period` is passed to `_engine_type`, it might not maintain the reference count properly, potentially leading to the garbage collection of `self` prematurely.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we should avoid using weak references in this context. We can directly pass `self` to `_engine_type` without using weak references.

### Corrected Version
```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
