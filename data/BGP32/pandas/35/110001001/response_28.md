### Analysis
The `_engine` function is using a `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self` and then passing it to the `_engine_type` method along with the length of `self`. The intention seems to be to avoid creating a reference cycle. However, the way the `weakref.ref` is used here is incorrect, and it may not achieve the desired result.

### Bug
The bug in the function is with the way `weakref.ref` is being used. When `period` is assigned the weak reference to `self` with `weakref.ref(self)`, simply passing `period` to `_engine_type` does not restore the original reference. Instead, `period` should be called to retrieve the original reference when needed.

### Fix
To fix the bug, modify the `_engine` function to correctly use `weakref.ref`:
1. Store `weakref.ref(self)` directly in the `period` variable.
2. When retrieving the original reference, call `period()`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
