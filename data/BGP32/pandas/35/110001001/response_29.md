### Analysis
The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is using a `cache_readonly` decorator, which indicates that the function is supposed to be cached and lazily evaluated. The function is intended to return an engine instance based on the input period index.

### Bug
The bug in the current implementation lies in the way the weak reference to `self` is being created. The `weakref.ref(self)` call should be passing `self` as an argument rather than assigning it to `period`. This way, the weak reference will be correctly associated with the `self` object.

### Fix
Modify the line `period = weakref.ref(self)` to `period = weakref.ref(self)()` to correctly create a weak reference to the `self` object.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self)(), len(self))
```
