### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance. However, the `weakref.ref` function returns a weak reference object, not the object itself. Therefore, when `self` is passed to `_engine_type`, it is actually passing a weak reference object rather than the `PeriodIndex` instance itself, leading to errors.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by passing a weak reference object (`period`) to `_engine_type` instead of the actual `PeriodIndex` instance.

### Fix
To fix this bug, we need to dereference `period` before passing it to `_engine_type`. We can achieve this by calling `period()` to get the actual object.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
