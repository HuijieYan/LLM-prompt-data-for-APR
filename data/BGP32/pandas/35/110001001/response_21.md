### Case 1
#### Runtime values and types of the input parameters of the buggy function
self, value: `PeriodIndex(['2019Q1', '2019Q2'], dtype='period[Q-DEC]', freq='Q-DEC')`, type: `PeriodIndex`

#### Variables inside the buggy function
- period: weakref to self

#### Bug explanation
The bug in the `_engine` function is related to how the weak reference `weakref.ref(self)` is assigned to `period`. The weak reference should be stored as a function parameter, not a variable within the function, to prevent it from being garbage collected before the engine is used.

#### Bug fix strategy
To fix this bug, the weak reference should be passed directly as an argument to the `_engine_type` constructor. This ensures that a reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained until the engine is created.

#### Corrected version
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```
