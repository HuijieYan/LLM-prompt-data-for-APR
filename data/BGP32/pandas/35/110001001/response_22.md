### Explanation:
The buggy function `_engine` is attempting to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object `self`. The intention behind creating a weak reference is to prevent a reference cycle, where the `PeriodIndex` object references `_engine`, and `_engine` references `self`, leading to memory leaks and prevent the garbage collector from collecting these objects.

However, the bug lies in the fact that `period = weakref.ref(self)` is creating a weak reference to `self`, but then the actual weak reference is not being used or passed around. Instead, the `_engine_type` function is being called with `self` directly, which defeats the purpose of using a weak reference.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to properly utilize the weak reference created in the `_engine` function. We should pass the weak reference to `_engine_type` instead of `self`.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
