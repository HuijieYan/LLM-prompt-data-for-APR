### Analysis
The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is intended to create an engine instance using the `_engine_type` constructor, passing a weak reference to the `self` object. However, the current implementation is incorrectly creating a weak reference but not using it when calling `_engine_type`.

### Bug
The bug in the provided function is that it creates a weak reference to `self` but does not dereference it when invoking `_engine_type`, which defeats the purpose of using a weak reference to avoid reference cycles.

### Fix
To fix the bug, you need to dereference the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`. We can achieve this by calling the weak reference object using `()` before passing it as an argument to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version
```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

By making this change, the function will correctly pass a weak reference object to `_engine_type`, preventing reference cycles and potential memory leaks.
