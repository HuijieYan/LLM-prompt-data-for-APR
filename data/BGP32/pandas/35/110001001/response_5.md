### Analysis
The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is attempting to create an instance of `_engine_type` by passing a weak reference to the `self` object. However, the weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` is not handled correctly, leading to issues with object references and potentially causing the bug.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by passing a weak reference to the `_engine_type` constructor, which might not work as intended. When the `self` object is being referenced weakly, it may get garbage collected prematurely, causing unexpected behavior or crashes.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, you should create a strong reference to the `self` object before passing it to the `_engine_type` constructor. This ensures that the `self` object remains accessible throughout the `_engine` function's execution.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = self  # Create a strong reference to self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By creating a strong reference to `self` within the `_engine` function, the potential issue with weak referencing should be resolved.
