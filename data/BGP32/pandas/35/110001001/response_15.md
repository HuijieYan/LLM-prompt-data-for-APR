### Explanation of the bug
The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is attempting to create an instance of an engine type using a weak reference to `self`. However, the weak reference is being stored incorrectly, which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

### Bug location
The bug is located in the following line:
```python
period = weakref.ref(self)
```

### Bug explanation
The `weakref.ref()` function creates a weak reference to the object passed to it. Instead of storing the weak reference, it should be accessed when needed to avoid a reference cycle. Storing it in a variable like `period` is incorrect and can cause issues.

### Fix strategy
Instead of storing the weak reference in a variable, we need to access it directly when creating the engine instance to prevent a reference cycle issue.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
``` 

In this corrected version, we directly pass the weak reference to `self` to `_engine_type` without storing it in an intermediate variable. This ensures that the weak reference is used correctly to prevent any potential issues related to reference cycles.
