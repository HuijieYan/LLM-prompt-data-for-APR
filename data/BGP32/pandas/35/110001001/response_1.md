### Analysis
The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is using a `cache_readonly` decorator, which indicates that the return value of the function will be cached. The function is attempting to create an instance of `_engine_type` passing a weak reference of `self` (the `PeriodIndex` object) and the length of `self`. However, the implementation of creating a weak reference is incorrect in the current implementation.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the current implementation lies in the line `period = weakref.ref(self)`. The `weakref.ref` function is expected to create a weak reference to the `self` object, but it is being used incorrectly. The `weakref.ref` function returns a callable object and not the weak reference itself. Hence, when the `period` object is used later, it might raise errors due to incorrect usage.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `period` object should be used as a weak reference by calling it as a function, i.e., `period()`. This would return the weak reference to the `self` object, which can be passed to `_engine_type` as intended.

### Corrected Version
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

The corrected version of the `_engine` function properly creates a weak reference using `period()` and passes it to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`.
