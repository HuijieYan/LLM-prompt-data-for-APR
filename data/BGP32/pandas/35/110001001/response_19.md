### Analysis
The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is intended to return an instance of an engine type based on the input parameters passed to it. However, in its current state, the function is attempting to create a weak reference to `self` but is not handling it correctly.

### Potential Error Location
The line causing the issue is `period = weakref.ref(self)`. Here, `weakref.ref` is used to create a weak reference to `self`, but it is not passed to the desired `_engine_type` function.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the `weakref.ref` call creates a weak reference object that needs to be dereferenced to obtain the actual object. The `_engine_type` function should receive the actual `self` object instead of a weak reference object.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, the weak reference object needs to be dereferenced before passing it to the `_engine_type` function. This can be achieved by calling the weak reference object `period` with `()` to obtain the actual object before passing it to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
