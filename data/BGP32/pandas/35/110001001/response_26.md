### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance, but it is not passing the reference to `_engine_type` correctly. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially cause reference cycles or memory leaks.


### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_engine` function arises from not passing the weak reference (`period`) correctly to the `_engine_type` constructor. This can cause a strong reference to be held instead of a weak reference, leading to potential memory leaks or reference cycles.


### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, modify the `_engine` function to correctly pass the weak reference (`period`) to the `_engine_type` constructor. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By invoking the weak reference `period` with `()` before passing it to `_engine_type`, we ensure that a strong reference is not held unintentionally, resolving the issue with potential memory leaks or reference cycles.
