### Analysis
- The `PeriodIndex` class has a `_engine` method that is decorated with `@cache_readonly`.
- The `_engine` method creates a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object and then calls the `_engine_type` method with the weak reference and length of the index.
- The bug in the function is that it creates a weak reference using `weakref.ref(self)` but doesn't store the actual referenced object anywhere, leading to a weak reference that immediately goes out of scope.

### Bug Explanation
- When the `_engine` method creates a weak reference using `weakref.ref(self)`, it should store the weak reference object in a variable for it to persist and keep the reference alive.
- In the current implementation, the weak reference to `self` is created but not stored, leading to the weak reference being immediately released.

### Fix
- To fix the bug, the weak reference object should be stored in a variable that has a longer lifespan than just the `_engine` method invocation.
- This can be achieved by storing the weak reference in a class attribute or a local variable outside of the `_engine` method scope.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    self_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self_weakref, len(self))
```
