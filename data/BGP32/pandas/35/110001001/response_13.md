### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref` incorrectly. The intention seems to be to pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type` method, but the implementation is incorrect.

### Bug Explanation
The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref(self)`. This statement creates a weak reference to `self`, but it doesn't capture the essence of `self` when passed to `_engine_type`. In the return statement, `self` should be referenced directly, not via a weak reference.

### Fix
To fix the bug, remove the `weakref.ref(self)` line and just pass `self` to `_engine_type`. Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
