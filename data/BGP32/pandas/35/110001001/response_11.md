The bug in the `_engine` function is that it is trying to create a weak reference to `self` and pass it to `_engine_type`, but it is not correctly handling the weak reference creation process.

The cause of the bug is that `weakref.ref(self)` should be stored in a variable outside the function to prevent it from being garbage collected while `_engine` is being executed.

To fix the bug, we need to store the weak reference to `self` outside the function scope and then use it when creating the engine instance. Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
``` 

By storing the weak reference in the `period_ref` variable outside the function, we ensure that it is not garbage collected while the function is executing, thereby fixing the bug.
