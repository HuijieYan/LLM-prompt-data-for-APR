The bug in the `_engine` function lies in the use of `weakref.ref(self)` without storing the actual reference. When `_engine` returns, the weak reference created does not maintain any reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Cause
The function `_engine` is meant to create an engine instance based on the `self._engine_type`, but in this implementation, the created `weakref` to `self` is not holding a strong reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance. As a result, the weak reference is lost as soon as `_engine` returns, causing potential issues accessing the `PeriodIndex` properties.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference created inside the `_engine` function retains a proper reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance to prevent it from being garbage collected prematurely when `_engine` returns.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a strong reference to self using the period variable
    period = self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By storing `self` directly in the `period` variable, we maintain a strong reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance, ensuring that it is not garbage collected before the engine type is created.
