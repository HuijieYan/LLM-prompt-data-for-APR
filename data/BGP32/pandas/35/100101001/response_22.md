### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is a `PeriodIndex` object. The intention seems to be to avoid creating a reference cycle. However, the bug lies in how the weak reference is being used. The return value of `_engine` is expected to be an instance of `_engine_type`, initialized with the weak reference and the length of the `PeriodIndex`.

### Bug Explanation
The bug lies in the way the weak reference is being used. When `weakref.ref(self)` is called, it returns a weak reference object. This object needs to be dereferenced using the `()` operator to get the actual object being referenced. In this case, the proper usage would be `period()`. Without this dereferencing step, the weak reference object `period` is being passed to `_engine_type`, resulting in unexpected behavior or errors.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to properly dereference the weak reference object before passing it to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

By correcting the code to dereference the weak reference object `period` before passing it to `_engine_type`, the function should now behave as intended and pass the failing test.
