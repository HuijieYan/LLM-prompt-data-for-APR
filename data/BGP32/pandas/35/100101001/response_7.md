### Analysis
The `@cache_readonly` decorator suggests that the `_engine` function is meant to be a cached property that returns the engine type for the PeriodIndex. The bug seems to be related to the creation of a weak reference to `self` and passing it to `_engine_type`. This weak reference might not be correctly handled, leading to issues with the engine creation.

### Bug
The bug is in the following line:
```python
period = weakref.ref(self)
```
The weak reference `period` is not being used correctly in the subsequent call to `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.

### Bug Cause
By creating a weak reference to `self`, we are not actually passing `self` to `_engine_type`, which might lead to unexpected behavior as `_engine_type` may rely on having a direct reference to `self`.

### Fix
Instead of creating a weak reference to `self`, the correct approach would be to directly pass `self` to `_engine_type`. 

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
