### Incorrect code analysis and bugs identified
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` on `self`, which is a `PeriodIndex` object. The intention seems to be to avoid reference cycles by passing a weak reference to `_engine_type`. However, the bug lies in how `weakref.ref` is used here. The correct approach is to create a weak reference object to `self` and then access it using the `()` operator to get the weakly referenced object.

### Bug explanation
In the buggy function, the `weakref.ref` function is not correctly utilized to access the weakly referenced object. By not using the `()` operator to access the weakly referenced object, `period` is not returning the actual weakly referenced `self` object, causing issues when `_engine_type` is called with this reference.

### Fix strategy
To fix the bug, the weakly referenced object should be accessed properly by using the `()` operator on the `weakref.ref` object. This will ensure that the actual weakly referenced object is passed to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected code
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
