### Case 1
#### Runtime values and types of the input parameters of the buggy function
self, value: `PeriodIndex(['2019Q1', '2019Q2'], dtype='period[Q-DEC]', freq='Q-DEC')`, type: `PeriodIndex`

#### Buggy function's behavior
The `_engine` function is meant to return an engine type based on the `self` PeriodIndex. However, in its current state, it is creating a weak reference to `self` but not using it properly when calling `_engine_type`. This could lead to issues with referencing the correct object.

#### Error location
The issue lies in the way weak reference `period` is created and then not utilized correctly when invoking `_engine_type`.

#### Bug explanation
The bug arises from not passing the weak reference `period` correctly to `_engine_type`, causing potential reference cycle problems and incorrect behavior when creating the engine type.

#### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the weak reference `period` needs to be utilized properly when calling `_engine_type`. Instead of creating a weak reference to just `self`, `period` should be dereferenced properly when passed to `_engine_type`.

#### Corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
