### Analysis
The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`. The intention behind using `weakref` is to avoid creating a reference cycle. However, in this context, it seems that the weak reference `period` is not being used correctly when passed to `_engine_type`.

The bug seems to be related to how the weak reference `period` is being handled in the `_engine` function, potentially leading to incorrect behavior in `_engine_type`.

### Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by passing the weak reference `period` instead of the original `self` object to the `_engine_type` function. This might lead to unexpected behavior or errors when `_engine_type` tries to use the weak reference instead of the actual object.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we pass the original `self` object to the `_engine_type` function, instead of the weak reference `period`. We can achieve this by dereferencing the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Dereference the weak reference to get the original object
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By dereferencing the weak reference using `weakref.proxy(self)`, we can pass the original object to the `_engine_type` function, which should resolve the bug and make the function work correctly with the provided test case.
