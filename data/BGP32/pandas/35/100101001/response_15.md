### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is a `PeriodIndex` object. The intention seems to be to avoid a reference cycle to prevent memory leaks. However, the problem lies in the way `weakref.ref()` is being used. `weakref.ref(self)` simply creates a weak reference and does not maintain the reference to `self`, leading to unexpected behavior when `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` is called. This results in a failure of the provided test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods`.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the weak reference created by `period = weakref.ref(self)` does not preserve the reference to `self` when used inside `_engine_type`, leading to incorrect behavior in the subsequent execution flow.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the reference to `self` is maintained throughout the execution of `_engine_type`. One way to achieve this is by storing a strong reference to `self` before creating the weak reference.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a strong reference to self before creating a weak reference
    period = self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
