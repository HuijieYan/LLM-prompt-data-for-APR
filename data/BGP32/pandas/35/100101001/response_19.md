### Analysis
- The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is then passed to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`.
- The issue might be related to how the weak reference is being used or the interaction with the `_engine_type` function.

### Bug Cause
- The bug may be caused by how the weak reference `period` is being passed to `_engine_type`, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or incorrect results.

### Fix Strategy
- Instead of passing a weak reference, a direct reference to `self` should be passed to `_engine_type` to ensure the correct behavior.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
