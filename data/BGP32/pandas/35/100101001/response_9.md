### Analysis
The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self` before passing it to `self._engine_type` along with the length of `self`. The bug seems to be related to how the weak reference is being used, potentially causing issues with object references.

### Bug Cause
The bug could be caused by the weak reference `period` not being correctly utilized when passed to `self._engine_type`, leading to incorrect behavior when accessing attributes of the original object.

### Fix Strategy
Ensure that the weak reference is properly converted back to the original object before using it within `self._engine_type` to correctly access its attributes without causing any reference cycle issues.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to avoid reference cycles
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Retrieve the original object from the weak reference
    period_obj = period()
    return self._engine_type(period_obj, len(self))
```
