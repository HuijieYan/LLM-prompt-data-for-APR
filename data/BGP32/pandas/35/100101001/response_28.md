### Analysis
- The `self` parameter is of type `PeriodIndex` containing two `Period` objects.
- The `_engine` function is trying to create a weak reference to the `self` parameter.
- The buggy function then uses `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` to create an engine object.

### Bug
The bug in the `_engine` function is that it is creating a weak reference to the `self` parameter but not using it correctly while creating the engine object. This leads to potential issues with the weak reference handling and might result in incorrect behavior.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to utilize the weak reference correctly to avoid reference cycle issues. We should dereference the weak reference before passing it to `self._engine_type()`.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

In the corrected version, the weak reference `period` is dereferenced by calling `period()` before passing it to `self._engine_type()`. This ensures that the engine object is created with the correct reference to the `self` parameter.
