### Analysis
The `_engine` function is using a weak reference to `self` and passing it to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`. This process seems correct to avoid reference cycles. However, the bug may be related to the way `weakref.ref(self)` is being used.

### Potential Error
The issue might be arising due to the weak reference not being properly stored and used within `_engine`.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug seems to be caused by the way the weak reference to `self` is being created but not correctly utilized within the `_engine` function, potentially leading to unexpected behavior when accessing `self`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is properly maintained and accessed within the `_engine` function. This may involve correctly storing the weak reference object and using it appropriately when calling `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a weak reference of self to avoid reference cycle
    self_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self_weakref, len(self))
``` 

By correctly storing the weak reference to `self` in a variable `self_weakref` and passing that to `_engine_type`, we can fix the bug. This corrected version should address the issue and pass the failing test.
