### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`. The `weakref.ref` function returns a weak reference object which can be used to access the original object (in this case, `self`) without creating a strong reference. However, the issue lies in how the weak reference `period` is being used. When `self` goes out of scope, `period` will no longer reference a valid object, leading to potential issues when `_engine` is called with a weak reference.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the current implementation is that `period` is created inside the `_engine` function as a weak reference to `self`, but it is not guaranteed that a valid reference to `self` will exist when `_engine` is called. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors when trying to use `period` to access `self`.

### Fix Strategy
In order to fix this bug, we should ensure that a strong reference to `self` is maintained during the execution of `_engine` so that it is guaranteed to be valid. One way to achieve this is by explicitly creating a strong reference to `self` using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`. This way, we ensure that the object `self` remains valid throughout the execution of `_engine`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a strong reference to self using weakref.proxy
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, we ensure that a strong reference to `self` is maintained during the execution of `_engine`, fixing the potential issues caused by using a weak reference.
