### Analysis
The `_engine` function is using a weak reference to avoid a reference cycle, but it seems the weak reference is not being utilized correctly within the function. The weak reference `period` is created but not being used to instantiate the `_engine_type`.

### Bug Explanation
The bug stems from not passing the weak reference `period` to `_engine_type`, resulting in a potential issue related to object lifecycle management or reference cycles.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to pass the weak reference `period` to `_engine_type` correctly.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

By calling `period()` when passing it to `_engine_type`, we get the referenced object instead of the weak reference, ensuring that the intended object is passed correctly.
