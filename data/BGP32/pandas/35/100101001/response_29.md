### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is supposed to return an instance of `_engine_type` by passing a weak reference to `self` and the length of `self` as parameters. However, the bug lies in creating a weak reference to `self` but not using it correctly when passing it to `_engine_type`.

### Bug
The bug in the code is that `period = weakref.ref(self)` creates a weak reference to `self`, but when it is used in `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, it does not dereference the weak reference to get the original object.

### Fix
To fix the bug, you need to dereference the weak reference object before passing it to `_engine_type`. You can do this by using `weakref.proxy()` instead of `weakref.ref()`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
