### Analysis
The `_engine` function is using a weak reference of `self` to create a period index but it is not handling the weak reference correctly. This can lead to the weak reference being lost, causing unexpected behavior.

### Bug
The bug in the `_engine` function lies in how the weak reference is being used and returned. The weak reference `period` is created but it's not being dereferenced correctly before returning the value.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to dereference the weak reference object before passing it to `_engine_type`. This way, we ensure that the weak reference does not get lost before being used.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    period_obj = period()
    return self._engine_type(period_obj, len(self))
```
