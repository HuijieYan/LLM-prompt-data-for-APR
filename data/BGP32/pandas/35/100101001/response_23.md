### Analysis
- The `_engine` function is caching the result using the `@cache_readonly` decorator, which means that the result is memoized and returned on subsequent calls.
- The function creates a weak reference to the `self` object and passes it to `_engine_type`.
- The issue may arise from the weak reference not being strong enough to keep the object alive.

### Bug Explanation
The bug arises because the weak reference `period` does not keep the `self` object alive long enough for the `_engine_type` to use it correctly. This may lead to unexpected behavior or errors when accessing the length of `self`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is strong enough to keep the `self` object alive during the call to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a strong reference to self to keep the object alive
    period = self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By removing the weak reference and directly using `self`, we ensure that the object is alive during the call to `_engine_type`.
