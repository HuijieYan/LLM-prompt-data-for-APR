### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is utilizing a weak reference to avoid creating a reference cycle. However, it seems to be incorrectly creating the weak reference using `weakref.ref(self)` and then passing it to `_engine_type`. This can lead to issues as `weakref.ref(self)` returns a weak reference object, not the actual object itself.

### Bug Explanation
The bug arises from passing a weak reference object to `_engine_type` instead of the actual object. This results in `_engine_type` potentially not being able to access the required attributes or methods of the object.

### Proposed Fix
Instead of creating a weak reference object, a fix would be to directly pass `self` to `_engine_type` while making sure that a reference cycle is avoided in the implementation of `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version
```python
from pandas import _engine_type

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return _engine_type(self, len(self))
```
