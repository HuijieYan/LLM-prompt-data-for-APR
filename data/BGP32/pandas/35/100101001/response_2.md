### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This weak reference is likely causing issues with the subsequent operations, leading to test failures.

### Bug Cause
The use of `weakref.ref(self)` is causing the weak reference to `self` to be passed to `_engine_type`, which may not handle the weak reference properly, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Fix
Instead of creating a weak reference to `self`, simply pass `self` directly to `_engine_type` to ensure that it receives the actual object reference.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
