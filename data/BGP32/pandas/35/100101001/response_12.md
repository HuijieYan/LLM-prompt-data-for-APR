### Analysis
The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self` (the `PeriodIndex` object) before passing it to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`. This weak reference creation may not work as intended and could be causing the function to fail.

### Bug Explanation
1. The `period` variable is assigned a weak reference to `self`, but it should be `weakref.ref(self)`.
2. Passing this weak reference `period` along with the length of `self` to `_engine_type` may not be the correct approach.

### Bug Fix Strategy
Create a weak reference to `self` correctly, and make sure the correct arguments are passed to `_engine_type` in the expected format.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# Corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)  # Create a weak reference correctly
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By making the above changes, the `_engine` function should now correctly create a weak reference and pass the necessary arguments to `_engine_type`, addressing the bug in the original version.
