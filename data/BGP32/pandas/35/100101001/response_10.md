### Analysis
The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is an instance of `PeriodIndex`. The intent is to avoid a reference cycle. However, the bug seems to arise from the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref`, which may not be preserving the reference properly.

### Bug
The bug stems from the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`.

### Fix Strategy
Since the bug likely arises from the misuse of `weakref.ref`, we can directly pass `self` to `_engine_type` instead of creating a weak reference.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
``` 

By directly passing `self` to `_engine_type`, we ensure that there is no issue with weak referencing. This corrected version should address the bug and make the failing test pass.
