### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object of type `PeriodIndex`. The intention seems to be to avoid creating a strong reference cycle that might lead to memory leaks. However, the bug lies in how the weak reference is being used with `self._engine_type`. The returned result from `_engine` should not be solely dependent on `period`, which is a weak reference.

### Bug Explanation
The bug stems from the fact that the weak reference `period` is being passed as an argument to `self._engine_type`. Due to the mechanics of weak references in Python, the `self` object may not be available when `_engine_type` is actually executed, causing unexpected behavior.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, avoid relying solely on the weak reference for creating the engine. Instead, directly use `self` or create a strong reference to it before passing it to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
``` 

By directly passing `self` to `_engine_type`, we ensure that a strong reference to the `self` object is used, eliminating the possibility of unexpected behavior due to weak references.
