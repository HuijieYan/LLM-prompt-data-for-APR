### Analysis
The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is a `PeriodIndex`. However, the issue lies in how the `weakref.ref` is being used. In the buggy implementation, `weakref.ref` is not being called with `self` as an argument, leading to a weak reference that is not handling the reference cycle correctly. This results in incorrect behavior when creating the `_engine_type` object.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by not passing `self` correctly to `weakref.ref`, resulting in an invalid weak reference that does not break the reference cycle as intended.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to pass `self` as an argument to `weakref.ref` to create a valid weak reference that correctly handles the reference cycle.

### The corrected version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

Update the code to pass `self` to `weakref.ref` function by calling `period()` to create a weak reference object and then passing it to the `_engine_type` constructor along with the length of the `PeriodIndex`. This way, a valid weak reference is created, resolving the reference cycle issue.
