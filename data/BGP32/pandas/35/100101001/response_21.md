### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is trying to create a weak reference to `self` (presumably a `PeriodIndex` object) and then pass that weak reference to `_engine_type`. However, the weak reference is not being utilized correctly, leading to potential issues with the reference cycle.

### Bug Cause
The bug likely arises from the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref(self)`. In this context, using `weakref.ref` creates a weak reference object that needs to be dereferenced to access the original object. However, the function is passing the weak reference object itself (`period`) instead of dereferencing it.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to dereference the weak reference object before passing it to `_engine_type`. This can be done by calling `period()` to obtain the original object that `period` refers to.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

This correction should properly dereference the weak reference object `period` before passing it to `_engine_type` and should address the bug in the function.
