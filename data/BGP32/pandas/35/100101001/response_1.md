### Analysis
The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is an instance of `PeriodIndex`. The intention is to avoid a reference cycle. However, the return statement uses this weak reference in `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. This might be causing unexpected behavior due to the weak reference.

### Bug Explanation
The bug is likely due to the weak reference `period` being passed to `self._engine_type`. Since `self._engine_type` expects a reference to the original object, passing a weak reference might be causing issues with the method.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, you can modify the `_engine` function to pass the original object rather than a weak reference. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

This change ensures that the original `self` object is passed to `_engine_type` instead of a weak reference. This should resolve the issue with the failing test.
