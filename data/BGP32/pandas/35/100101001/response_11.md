### Analysis
The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref` incorrectly by passing `self` directly instead of `self` wrapped in `weakref.ref`. This incorrect usage leads to a reference cycle issue.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by passing `self` directly to `weakref.ref` instead of wrapping `self` in `weakref.ref`. This results in a circular reference, which can lead to memory leaks and unexpected behavior.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the correct approach is to wrap `self` in `weakref.ref` before passing it to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
