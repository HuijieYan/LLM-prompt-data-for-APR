### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`. However, the issue lies in the fact that `weakref.ref()` returns a weak reference object, not `self` itself. This causes a problem when trying to construct the `_engine_type` object using the weak reference.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by incorrectly using `weakref.ref()` in the `_engine` function. Instead of just getting a weak reference to `self`, it should be storing the weak reference and passing the actual referenced object when needed.

### Fix Strategy
1. Store the weak reference obtained from `weakref.ref(self)` in a variable.
2. Pass the referenced object when constructing the `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Pass the referenced object instead of the weak reference
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
