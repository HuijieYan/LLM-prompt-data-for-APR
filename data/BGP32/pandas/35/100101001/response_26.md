### Analysis
The `_engine` function seems to be trying to create an instance of `self._engine_type` with a weak reference to `self`. However, the weak reference is being incorrectly assigned, leading to potential issues with the reference cycle.

### Potential Error Location
The issue seems to be with how the weak reference is being created using `weakref.ref(self)`. 

### Cause of the Bug
The bug may be caused by assigning the weak reference incorrectly or not using it properly later on in the `_engine` function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Make sure to correctly create a weak reference to `self`.
2. Ensure that the weak reference is used properly in creating the new instance of `self._engine_type`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Correctly create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Use the weak reference to create the engine type
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
