### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is supposed to return an instance based on the `self._engine_type` with a weak reference to `self` as an argument. However, the current implementation creates a weak reference `period` but does not use it correctly when calling `self._engine_type`. This can lead to a potential issue where the weak reference may not behave as intended, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Cause
The bug in the `_engine` function lies in how the weak reference `period` is used. The weak reference should be dereferenced to obtain the actual object before passing it to `self._engine_type`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to dereference the weak reference `period` before passing it to `self._engine_type`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    period = period_ref()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By dereferencing `period_ref` with `period = period_ref()`, we can obtain the actual object referenced by the weak reference before passing it to `self._engine_type`, ensuring that the intended behavior is maintained.
