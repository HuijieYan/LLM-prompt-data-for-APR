### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`. However, the issue lies in the fact that `weakref.ref` creates a weak reference object, not the actual reference. Therefore, when `_engine_type` is called with `period`, which is a weak reference object, it causes the bug.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by passing a weak reference object to `_engine_type` instead of the actual reference to `self`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to pass the actual reference to `self` to `_engine_type` instead of a weak reference object.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
