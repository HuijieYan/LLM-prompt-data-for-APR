### Analysis
The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`. However, the way it is being used is incorrect, as `weakref.ref(self)` should be called with `()` to reference `self` correctly.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by using `weakref.ref(self)` without calling it with `()` to create a weak reference to `self`.

### Fix
Correct the function implementation by calling `weakref.ref(self)` with `()`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
