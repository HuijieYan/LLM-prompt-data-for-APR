### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` incorrectly. The `weakref.ref` function creates a weak reference to the object `self`, but it does not return the object itself. So when `_engine_type` is called with `period` as an argument, it's actually passing a weak reference object instead of the intended `self`.

### Bug
The bug in the current function is that `period` is a weak reference to `self`, not `self` itself, which leads to unexpected behavior when `_engine_type` is called with `period`.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to pass `self` directly to `_engine_type`, without using `weakref.ref`. This will ensure that `_engine_type` receives the actual `self` object.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
