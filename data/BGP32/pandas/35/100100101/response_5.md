### Analyzing the buggy function and failing test

1. The buggy function `_engine` is a method that uses `weakref.ref` to avoid a reference cycle and then calls `_engine_type` with the weak reference and the length of `self`.
   
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is testing for monotonicity in the levels of a `MultiIndex`, which involves creating `PeriodIndex` instances.

### Identifying the bug

The bug lies in the use of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`. This weak reference is then being passed to `_engine_type`, but the weak reference is not being correctly leveraged within `_engine_type`. This could be causing the issue in the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy

The correct approach would be to use the weak reference properly within the `_engine_type` function so that the reference cycle is avoided without affecting the functionality of the code.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we create a weak proxy reference to `self` which can be used safely within `_engine_type` while avoiding the reference cycle. This should fix the bug and ensure that the failing test passes.
