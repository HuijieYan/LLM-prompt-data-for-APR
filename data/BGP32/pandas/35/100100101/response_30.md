### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`. However, `weakref.ref` returns a weak reference object, not the actual object. This results in passing the weak reference object to `_engine_type`, which causes an issue in the function's execution.

### Bug Explanation
In this case, the bug stems from the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref`. When `weakref.ref(self)` is returned, it does not provide the actual `self` object but a weak reference to it. As a result, passing this weak reference to `_engine_type` causes unexpected behavior and failure in the test.

### Bug fix strategy
To fix this bug, we need to retrieve the actual object from the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`. This can be achieved by using `period()` method on the weak reference object returned by `weakref.ref(self)`.

### Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weak_period(), len(self))
``` 

By using `weak_period()`, we obtain the actual object from the weak reference and then pass it to `_engine_type`, fixing the issue and ensuring the corrected function behaves as expected.
