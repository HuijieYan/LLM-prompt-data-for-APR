### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, but it is not using it correctly when passing it to `_engine_type`. The issue may be related to the incorrect usage of the weak reference.

### Bug Explanation
- The function `_engine` is intended to return an instance of `_engine_type` with a weak reference to `self`.
- However, the current implementation is not utilizing the weak reference properly when passing it to `_engine_type`. This can cause unexpected behavior or errors.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Properly utilize the weak reference obtained from `weakref.ref(self)` when passing it to `_engine_type`.
- Make sure to dereference the weak reference when using it to create the `_engine` instance.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_weakref, len(self))
```
