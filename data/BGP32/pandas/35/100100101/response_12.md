### Analysis
The buggy `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref` incorrectly by passing `self` as an argument. This creates a weak reference to `self` which does not serve the intended purpose of avoiding a reference cycle. The correct approach is to pass `self` to the `_engine_type` function directly without using `weakref.ref`.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `@cache_readonly` decorated `_engine` function is causing the `self` object to be passed as a weak reference instead of directly. This leads to incorrect behavior when the `self` object is accessed within the `_engine_type` function, resulting in failing the test `test_get_level_values_when_periods`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to directly pass `self` to the `_engine_type` function, eliminating the unnecessary use of `weakref.ref`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
