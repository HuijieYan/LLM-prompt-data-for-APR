### Analysis
The bug in the `_engine` function seems to stem from creating a weak reference to `self` but not using it correctly when calling `_engine_type`. This may lead to issues with reference cycles and incorrect behavior.

### Bug Explanation
1. The function creates a weak reference to `self` as `period = weakref.ref(self)`, but it doesn't use this weak reference when calling `_engine_type`.
2. The return statement passes `self` directly to `_engine_type`, which may cause potential reference cycle issues and unexpected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Use the weak reference (`period`) correctly when calling `_engine_type`.
2. Ensure the weak reference is dereferenced properly to get the actual object it refers to.

### Corrected Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

Applying this fix, the corrected function now dereferences the weak reference `period` before passing it to `_engine_type`, ensuring that reference cycles are avoided and the function operates correctly.
