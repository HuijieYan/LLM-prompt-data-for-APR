### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` incorrectly. The purpose of `weakref.ref` is to create a weak reference to an object without keeping it alive. In this case, it is being used incorrectly to create a weak reference to `self`, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Explanation
In the buggy function `_engine`, the `weakref.ref(self)` line creates a weak reference to the `self` object, which is the `PeriodIndex` instance in this case. This weak reference is then passed to `_engine_type`, which may cause issues as the weak reference does not keep the object alive.

### Fix Strategy
Instead of creating a weak reference to `self`, a more appropriate approach would be to pass `self` directly to `_engine_type` without using `weakref`. This will ensure that the object stays alive during the function call.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
