### Analysis
The bug in the `_engine` function lies in the usage of `weakref.ref(self)`. The intention was to create a weak reference to `self`, but this line actually creates a weak reference to the `self` method. This leads to an incorrect reference passed to `_engine_type`, resulting in unexpected behavior.

### Bug Cause
The bug causes a weak reference to be created for the method `self` instead of the object instance `self`. This results in the `_engine_type` function receiving the method reference instead of the actual object instance, leading to errors when trying to access attributes or methods of the `PeriodIndex` class.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to create a weak reference to the object instance `self` instead of the method `self`. This can be achieved by directly passing `self` to `weakref.ref()`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By directly passing `self` to `weakref.ref()`, we ensure that a weak reference to the object instance is created, fixing the bug.
