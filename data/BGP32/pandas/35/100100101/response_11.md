### Analysis
The issue in the `_engine` function arises from incorrectly creating a weak reference to `self` using `weakref.ref(self)` which does not preserve the reference to the `self` object. This results in a failure when trying to access attributes or methods of `self` inside `_engine_type` function.

### Bug Explanation
1. The `period = weakref.ref(self)` line creates a weak reference to `self`.
2. When `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` is called, the weak reference `period` is passed instead of the actual `self` object.
3. The `_engine_type` function expects a reference to the `PeriodIndex` object `self` but receives a weak reference, leading to errors.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The fix involves passing the actual object `self` to the `_engine_type` function instead of a weak reference. This can be achieved by directly passing `self` without the need for `weakref.ref`.

### Corrected Version of the Function

def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
