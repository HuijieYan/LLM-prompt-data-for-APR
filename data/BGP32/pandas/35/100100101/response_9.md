The buggy function `_engine` is trying to create a weak reference of `self` which is a `PeriodIndex` object and then pass that weak reference to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`. However, the bug lies in creating the weak reference using `weakref.ref(self)` because it should be `period = weakref.ref(self)`.

The corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By correcting the error in creating the weak reference, the function now correctly creates and passes the weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`.

This corrected version of the `_engine` function should now pass the failing test provided.
