### Analysis
1. The `_engine` function is a cached property that returns the `_engine_type` with weak reference to avoid a circular reference cycle.
2. The bug lies in creating the weak reference using the `weakref.ref` method, it should have been passed the `self` object as an argument.
3. Due to the incorrect implementation, the `self` object is not properly referenced by the weak reference, causing issues in the subsequent usage of `_engine_type`.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused because the `weakref.ref` method is called with `self` as an argument, instead of creating a weak reference to `self`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, modify the weak reference creation by passing `self` as an argument to `weakref.ref` method.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
