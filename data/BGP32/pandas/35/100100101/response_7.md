### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is supposed to create an instance of `_engine_type` passing a weak reference of `self` and the length of `self` as arguments. However, the use of `weakref.ref` is incorrect as it returns a weak reference object, not the actual weak reference itself. This is likely causing issues when creating the `_engine_type` instance.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by using `weakref.ref(self)` incorrectly. The correct approach should be to create a weak reference to `self` like `weakref.proxy(self)`.

### Bug Fix
Update the `_engine` function to use `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
