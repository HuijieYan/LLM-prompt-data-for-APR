### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` (PeriodIndex object), but it is not correctly passing it to `_engine_type`. This could lead to a reference cycle issue and potentially cause memory leaks.

### Bug Explanation
In the buggy function `_engine`, the weak reference `period` is not being correctly used when calling `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. This can lead to the `self` object not being properly handled by `_engine_type`, causing unexpected behavior or memory leaks.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to pass the weak reference object `period` retrieved from `weakref.ref(self)` to `_engine_type` correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
