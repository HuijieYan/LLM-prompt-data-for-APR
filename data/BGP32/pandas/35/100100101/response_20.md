### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` has an issue with the way it creates a weak reference to `self` using `weakref.ref(self)`. This reference is then used to initialize `self._engine_type` which ultimately leads to the bug. The weak reference should be stored in a variable instead of directly passing it to `self._engine_type`.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the weak reference created by `weakref.ref(self)` is not saved in a variable, leading to the garbage collection of the weak reference object before it can be used by `self._engine_type`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to store the weak reference in a variable and then pass that variable to `self._engine_type`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
