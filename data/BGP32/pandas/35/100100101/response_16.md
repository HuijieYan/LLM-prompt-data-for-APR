### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` incorrectly by passing `self` directly instead of `self` object. This results in a weak reference to the `self` object, rather than the intended weak reference to the `self` object's data.

### Bug Explanation
The buggy function fails to create a weak reference to the `self` object's data correctly. This causes issues when accessing the data later on, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to create a weak reference to the `self` object's data rather than the `self` object itself. This can be done by passing `self._values` instead of `self` to `weakref.ref`.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self's data to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self._values)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
