### Analysis
The bug in the `_engine` function lies in the use of `weakref.ref` on `self` which creates a weak reference to `self` instead of the actual reference. This causes issues when trying to pass it to `_engine_type`. The correct approach would be to pass `self` directly without creating a weak reference.

### Bug Cause
The bug causes the weak reference `period` to be passed to `_engine_type`, which may lead to unexpected behavior or errors as `_engine_type` may not be able to handle a weak reference.

### Fix Strategy
Remove the usage of `weakref.ref` and directly pass `self` to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
