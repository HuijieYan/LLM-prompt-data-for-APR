### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is attempting to create a weak reference to `self` and then use that weak reference to call `_engine_type` with the weak reference and the length of `self`. The issue here is that `weakref.ref()` creates a weak reference object, not the actual weak reference itself. This means that the `period` variable is not the weak reference to `self` but a weak reference object.

### Bug Explanation
- In the buggy function, `period` is assigned the weak reference object instead of the weak reference to `self`.
- When calling `_engine_type(period, len(self))`, it incorrectly passes the weak reference object, not the expected weak reference to `self`.
- This results in unexpected behavior in the `_engine_type` method.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to correctly create a weak reference to `self`. We can achieve this by using `weakref.proxy()` instead of `weakref.ref()`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use weakref.proxy() to create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
