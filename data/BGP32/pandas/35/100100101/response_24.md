### Analysis
The bug in the `_engine` function is that it is trying to create a weak reference to `self`, but instead of passing `self` to `weakref.ref`, it is passing the class `self.__class__`. This results in an incorrect weak reference being created which causes issues with the `_engine_type` method.

### Bug Explanation
- In the buggy function, the line `period = weakref.ref(self)` should be changed to `period = weakref.ref(self)` to correctly create a weak reference to the `self` object.
- Due to the incorrect weak reference creation, when `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` is called, it may not behave as expected and lead to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Correct the reference creation by passing `self` instead of `self.__class__` to `weakref.ref`.
- Update the return statement to use the corrected weak reference `period`.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Correctly pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
