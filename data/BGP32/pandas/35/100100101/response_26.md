### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref` to create a weak reference of `self`, which is an instance of `PeriodIndex`, and then passing it to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`. The issue here is that `weakref.ref` creates a weak reference object, but it needs to be called to obtain the actual weak reference.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_engine` function is that `period = weakref.ref(self)` should be `period = weakref.ref(self)()`, which would actually return the weak reference object. As a result, the function is passing an incorrect reference to `_engine_type`, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to call `period = weakref.ref(self)()` to get the weak reference object before passing it to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
