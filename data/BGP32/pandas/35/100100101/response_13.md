### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, but it should be passing `self` directly to `_engine_type`. This mistake causes the function to return an incorrect result, leading to the failing test.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_engine` function arises from passing a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type` instead of `self` directly. This incorrect usage of weak reference results in unexpected behavior and incorrect return values.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to pass `self` directly to `_engine_type` instead of creating a weak reference. This will ensure that the correct reference is used and the function returns the expected output.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
