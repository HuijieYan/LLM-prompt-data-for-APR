### Analysis
The bug in the `_engine` function is that it creates a weak reference to `self` incorrectly. Instead of creating a weak reference to `self`, it mistakenly creates a weak reference to `self._values` by using `weakref.ref(self)`.

### Bug
The bug is caused by creating a weak reference to `self._values` rather than `self`. This results in `self` being garbage collected prematurely, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to create a weak reference to `self` instead of `self._values`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    weak_self = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weak_self, len(self))
```
