The bug in the `_engine` function is that it mistakenly creates a weak reference to `self` instead of passing the `self` object directly to `_engine_type`. This causes a reference cycle issue and leads to incorrect behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to directly pass `self` to `_engine_type` without creating a weak reference.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By making this change, the `_engine` function now correctly passes the `self` object directly to `_engine_type`, resolving the reference cycle issue.

After applying this fix, the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` should pass successfully with the expected input/output values.
