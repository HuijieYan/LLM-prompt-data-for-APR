### Analysis
The bug in the `_engine` function is that it incorrectly creates a weak reference to `self` using `weakref.ref(self)` instead of passing `self` directly to `_engine_type`. This results in a weak reference object being returned instead of the actual `self` object, causing issues in the subsequent code where `len(self)` is being used.

### Bug Cause
The `weakref.ref(self)` should be `self` to correctly pass the `self` object to `_engine_type` without creating a weak reference.

### Fix Strategy
- Modify the `_engine` function to directly pass `self` to `_engine_type`.
- Update the return statement to `return self._engine_type(self, len(self))`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By applying this correction, the function will correctly pass the `self` object to `_engine_type` without creating a weak reference, resolving the issue in the failing test case mentioned.
