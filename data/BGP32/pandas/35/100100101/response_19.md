### Analysis
The bug in the `_engine` function is related to the creation of a weak reference using `weakref.ref(self)` instead of `weakref.proxy(self)`. This can lead to errors when trying to access or use the weak reference later on. 

### Cause of the Bug
The bug causes the weak reference `period` to be created incorrectly, leading to potential issues when trying to use this weak reference later. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` specifically tests the behavior of the `PeriodIndex` with regards to `_engine`, and since the weak reference is not properly created, it can result in failures.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to use `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to self. This will ensure that the weak reference behaves as expected and does not create potential errors during later use.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
