### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` incorrectly. The intention seems to be passing a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`, but the implementation is incorrect. The bug is likely causing issues with the reference cycle management.

### Bug
The bug lies in how `weakref.ref(self)` is used to create a weak reference. The correct way to create a weak reference using `weakref.ref` is to call it with the object directly, not with an instance of it. Therefore, the line `period = weakref.ref(self)` is incorrect and should be fixed.

### Fix
- Instead of `period = weakref.ref(self)`, the correct implementation should be `period = weakref.ref(self)()`

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# the corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

After applying this correction, the `_engine` function should work as expected and pass the failing test case.
