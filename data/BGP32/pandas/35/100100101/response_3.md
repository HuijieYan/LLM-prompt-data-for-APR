### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` (the `PeriodIndex` object). This weak reference is then being passed to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self` to create the engine object.
2. The bug lies in the usage of `weakref.ref(self)`, which creates a weak reference object and not the `self` object itself.
3. The expected input parameters `self._values` and `self` are `PeriodArray` and `PeriodIndex` objects respectively. The function should return an engine object created using the `self` object, not a weak reference object.
4. To fix the bug, we need to change how the reference to `self` is created in the `_engine` function.

### Solution
Modify the `_engine` function to create a reference to `self` directly without using `weakref`. 

### Corrected code
```python
# The relative path of the correct file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
