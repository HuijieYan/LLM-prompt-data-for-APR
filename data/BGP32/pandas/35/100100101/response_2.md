### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, which seems intended to avoid a reference cycle.
2. The issue lies in the usage of `weakref.ref(self)`. This creates a weak reference object, not the actual object itself, which can cause unexpected behavior when accessing the weak reference later.
3. In the failing test, the expected values provide insights into the correct types and values that should be returned by the function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is correctly resolved to the actual object before passing it to `_engine_type`.

### Bug Explanation
The `weakref.ref(self)` line in the `_engine` function creates a weak reference to the `self` object, which may not be what is intended. When this weak reference is passed to `_engine_type`, it may not correctly resolve to the `self` object due to weak references not behaving like direct object references.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to dereference the weak reference created by `weakref.ref(self)` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This can be done by calling the weak reference object to retrieve the actual object it references.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the function

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
