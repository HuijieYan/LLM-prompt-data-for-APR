### Analysis
The bug in the `_engine` function lies in how it handles creating a weak reference to `self`. The `weakref.ref` function returns a weak reference object, not the object itself. This causes an issue when `self` is passed to `_engine_type`, as it expects the actual object, not a weak reference.

### Bug Explanation
In the buggy function, `period = weakref.ref(self)` creates a weak reference `period` to `self`. When `period` is passed to `_engine_type`, it is expecting `self` itself, not a weak reference to `self`. This causes a type mismatch error and leads to the failing test since `_engine_type` cannot operate on a weak reference object.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to pass `self` directly to `_engine_type` instead of a weak reference. We can achieve this by simply removing the `weakref.ref` call and directly passing `self` to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
