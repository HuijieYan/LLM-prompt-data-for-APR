### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` incorrectly. It is passing `self` directly to `weakref.ref`, but it should pass an instance of the class to create a weak reference. This incorrect usage leads to a weak reference that does not point to the intended object.

### Bug Explanation
1. The buggy function `_engine` tries to create a weak reference to `self` by calling `weakref.ref(self)`.
2. This call does not create a proper weak reference.
3. When the `_engine_type` function uses this weak reference, it fails to access the properties of the `self` object correctly.
4. This results in incorrect behavior, leading to failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the correct approach is to pass an instance of the class (in this case, `PeriodIndex`) to `weakref.ref` to create a proper weak reference to that instance. This will ensure that the object referenced by the weak reference is the intended object.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Pass a weakref of the class instance, not self directly
    period = weakref.ref(type(self))
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By correctly passing `type(self)` instead of `self` to `weakref.ref`, we ensure that a weak reference to the class instance is created, resolving the bug in the function.
