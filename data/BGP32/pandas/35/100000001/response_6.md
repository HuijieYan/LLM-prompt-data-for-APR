The potential issue in the provided buggy function is that the weakref is not being properly used. As per the code, a weak reference `period` is created, but it should be dereferenced before being passed to `_engine_type`.

The cause of the bug is that when `weakref.ref(self)` is used, it creates a weak reference object to `self`, which needs to be dereferenced using the `()` call before being passed as an argument to `_engine_type`.

To fix the bug, we need to dereference the weak reference object `period` by calling `period()` before passing it to `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref(), len(self))
```
