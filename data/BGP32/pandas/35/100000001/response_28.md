The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` which is the instance of the class. The intention behind using weak reference is to avoid reference cycles, especially when dealing with objects that have circular references.

The bug in the provided function is that it is passing the weak reference object `period` directly to `_engine_type` function, which expects an actual reference to the object, not a weak reference.

To fix this bug, we need to dereference the weak reference object before passing it to `_engine_type` function. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `period()` is called to dereference the weak reference and pass the actual object to the `_engine_type` function. This should resolve the bug and ensure the correct behavior of the function.
