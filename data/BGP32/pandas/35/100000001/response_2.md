## Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`. However, it is not correctly passing this weak reference to the `_engine_type` constructor. The `weakref.ref()` function returns a weak reference object and not the object itself. Therefore, passing `period` (the weak reference) to `_engine_type` is incorrect.

## Potential Errors:
1. Incorrect usage of `weakref.ref()` function.
2. Incorrect passing of the weak reference object to `_engine_type`.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by passing the weak reference object instead of the actual object to the `_engine_type` constructor.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to extract the actual object from the weak reference before passing it to the `_engine_type` constructor.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Extract the actual object from the weak reference
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

In the corrected version, we used `weakref.proxy(self)` to extract the actual object from the weak reference before passing it to the `_engine_type`. This ensures that the correct object is being passed to the constructor.
