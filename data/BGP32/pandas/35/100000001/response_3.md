## Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref()` to create a weak reference to `self`, but the implementation of creating a weak reference is incorrect. The `weakref.ref()` function returns a weak reference object, but it is not getting the actual reference to the object. 

## Identification of Potential Errors:
1. Incorrect usage of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`.
2. The weak reference should be dereferenced to get the actual reference before passing it to `_engine_type`.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref(self)` which returns a weak reference object instead of the actual reference to `self`. This results in a weak reference object being passed to `_engine_type` instead of the actual reference to `self`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to dereference the weak reference object obtained from `weakref.ref()` to get the actual reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

In the corrected version, `weakref.proxy(self)` is used to create a weak reference to `self` and the weak reference is dereferenced to get the actual reference before passing it to `_engine_type`.
