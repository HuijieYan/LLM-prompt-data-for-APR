The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` and then passing it to `_engine_type` to create an instance. However, the issue here is that `weakref.ref(self)` does not return the object itself but a weak reference object. So, when `_engine_type` is called with `period`, it's actually passing a weak reference object instead of the original object.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the code to extract the original object from the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we directly assign `self` to the `period` variable, ensuring that the original object is passed to `_engine_type`.

This fix should resolve the bug and correctly pass the original object instance to `_engine_type`.
