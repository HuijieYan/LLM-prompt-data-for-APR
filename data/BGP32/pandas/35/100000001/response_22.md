## Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`, but it is not correctly passing this weak reference to `_engine_type`. The correct use of weak references involves creating a weak reference to an object and then accessing the object through this weak reference. In this case, `period` should be used to access `self` when calling `_engine_type`.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by passing the weak reference object `period` instead of accessing `self` through `period` when calling `_engine_type`.

## Strategy to Fix the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the return statement to correctly access `self` through the weak reference `period` before passing it to `_engine_type`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

In the corrected version, `period()` is called to access the original object `self` through the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`.
