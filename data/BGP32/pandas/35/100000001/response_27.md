The buggy function named `_engine` is trying to return an instance of `self._engine_type` using a weak reference to `self` to avoid reference cycles. The function creates a weak reference to the `self` object, named `period`, and then calls `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` to create the engine object.

However, the issue lies in the line `period = weakref.ref(self)` where `period` is assigned the weak reference object. When using this weak reference object to create the `self._engine_type` object, it does not correctly capture the reference to `self` as expected due to the weak reference.

To fix this bug, we need to pass the actual object instead of the weak reference object to `_engine_type`. We can achieve this by accessing the actual object from the weak reference using `period()`. By calling `period()` we can retrieve the original object that `period` was referencing.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In this corrected version, `period()` is called to retrieve the actual object that `period` weakly references before passing it to `_engine_type`. This should ensure that the intended object is correctly passed to `_engine_type` without causing reference cycle issues.
