## Analysis:
1. The function `_engine` is a cached read-only property that returns an engine type based on the `self` object.
2. The function creates a weak reference to the `self` object to avoid reference cycles.
3. The weak reference is passed to the `_engine_type` constructor along with the length of `self`.
4. The potential error location is in the creation of the weak reference using `weakref.ref(self)`.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug in the provided function is that the weak reference `period` is not dereferenced before being passed to the `_engine_type`. When weak references are used, they need to be dereferenced to obtain the original object they reference. In this case, the weak reference `period` should be dereferenced to get the actual `self` object before passing it to `_engine_type`.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to dereference the weak reference `period` before passing it to the `_engine_type`. This can be done using the `period()` method of the weak reference. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref(), len(self))
``` 

In the fixed version, `period_ref()` dereferences the weak reference to obtain the original object referenced by `self`, which is then passed to `_engine_type`.
