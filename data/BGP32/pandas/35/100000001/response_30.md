## Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is attempting to use weak references to avoid creating reference cycles. However, the mistake lies in how the weak reference is being created. Instead of creating a weak reference to the `self` object, it is creating a weak reference to the attribute `self`, which will not achieve the desired result.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by creating a weak reference to the `self` attribute instead of the `self` object. This results in `period` holding a weak reference to the attribute `self` rather than the instance of the class.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the weak reference is created. We should pass `self` directly to `weakref.ref()` to create a weak reference to the instance of the class rather than an attribute.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self to avoid reference cycles.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we pass `self` to `weakref.ref()` to create a weak reference to the instance of the class. This change will address the bug and ensure that a proper weak reference is created to avoid reference cycles.
