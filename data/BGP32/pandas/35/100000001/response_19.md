The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref()` to create a weak reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`. However, the problem is that `weakref.ref()` returns a weak reference object, not the actual object itself. This means that when `_engine_type` is called, it receives a weak reference object instead of the actual object, which would lead to errors.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to retrieve the actual object from the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self) # using proxy instead of ref to retrieve the actual object
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we ensure that the actual object is passed to `_engine_type`, avoiding any potential errors caused by passing a weak reference object.
