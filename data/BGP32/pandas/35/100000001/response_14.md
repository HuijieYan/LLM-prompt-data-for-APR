### Buggy Function Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference object to `self` and passing it to `_engine_type` method along with the length of `self`. The intention of using `weakref.ref` is to avoid creating a reference cycle. However, the bug in this function lies in the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The weak reference object `period` is being returned directly to the `_engine_type` method.
2. The weak reference object is not used in a way that prevents the reference cycle.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the function is caused by returning the weak reference object `period` directly to the `_engine_type` method. This will not prevent the reference cycle from occurring.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, the weak reference object `period` should be dereferenced and its result should be passed to the `_engine_type` method.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version of the function, `period()` is used to dereference the weak reference object before passing it to the `_engine_type` method. This ensures that the weak reference object does not create a reference cycle.
