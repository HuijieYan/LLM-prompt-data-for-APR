## Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`. The intention here seems to be to avoid a reference cycle. However, the bug lies in the fact that `weakref.ref(self)` is being assigned to `period`, but it should actually be passed directly to `_engine_type`.

## Error Location:
The error is in the line `period = weakref.ref(self)`. Using `weakref.ref(self)` creates a weak reference object to `self`, but it should directly pass the weak reference object to `_engine_type`.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the weak reference object created using `weakref.ref(self)` is stored in a variable `period` instead of being directly passed to `_engine_type`. This results in a strong reference to `self` being kept, thus defeating the purpose of using weak references.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should directly pass the weak reference object created by `weakref.ref(self)` to `_engine_type` without storing it in a variable first.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# This is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
``` 

By making this correction, the weak reference to `self` is passed directly to `_engine_type`, ensuring that a strong reference to `self` is not kept unnecessarily.
