## Analyzing the buggy function:

1. The function `_engine` is a cached readonly function that returns the engine type based on the input `self`.
2. The function uses `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object before passing it to `_engine_type`.
3. The purpose of using a weak reference is to avoid creating a reference cycle which can lead to memory leaks.

## Identified potential error locations:
1. The use of `weakref.ref(self)` might not be correctly implemented, causing unexpected behavior in the function.
2. The way the `_engine_type` is being called with the weak reference could be causing the issue.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug in the current function lies in how the weak reference to `self` is being created and passed to `_engine_type`. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior and errors due to incorrect handling of weak references.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is correctly created and passed to `_engine_type`. This involves modifying the way the weak reference is created and used within the function.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_weakref(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, the weak reference is now being correctly created by calling `period_weakref()` to get the referenced object before passing it to `_engine_type`. This ensures that the weak reference is used as intended without causing any unexpected behavior or errors.
