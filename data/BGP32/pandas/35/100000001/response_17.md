1. Analyzing the buggy function:
The function `_engine` is using a `weakref.ref()` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is supposed to prevent reference cycles. However, the problem lies in how this weak reference is being passed to `_engine_type`.

2. Potential error locations:
The issue seems to be with how `period` is being used in the call to `_engine_type`.

3. Cause of the bug:
When passing `period` to `_engine_type`, it is not being dereferenced properly, which may lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to dereference the weak reference `period` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This can be done by calling `period()` to get the actual reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`.

5. Corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `period()` is called to get the actual reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`, ensuring that the weak reference is properly dereferenced.
