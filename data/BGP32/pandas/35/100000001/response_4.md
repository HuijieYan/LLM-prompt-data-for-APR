The buggy function `_engine` in the code provided is trying to create a weak reference to the object `self` and then pass that weak reference to the `_engine_type` method. The intention here seems to be to avoid reference cycles that can lead to memory leaks.

However, the bug in this function lies in the way the weak reference is being created. The correct way to create a weak reference in Python is by directly passing the object to the `weakref.ref()` function, like `weakref.ref(self)`. But in the provided code, the weak reference is being created by assigning the result of `weakref.ref(self)` to a variable `period`, which doesn't serve any purpose.

To fix this bug, we should directly pass `self` to the `weakref.ref()` function and then use that weak reference to avoid reference cycles. The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
``` 

In the corrected version, `period_ref` is used to hold the weak reference to `self`, and that weak reference is correctly passed to the `_engine_type` method. This will help avoid reference cycles and potential memory leaks in the code.
