## Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the object `self`. However, the correct usage of `weakref.ref` should involve calling `()` method on the created weak reference object to get a strong reference to the original object. This bug can lead to unexpected behavior as `period` is expected to be a weak reference.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not calling the `()` method on the weak reference object created by `weakref.ref(self)`, which results in `period` being a weak reference object instead of a strong reference to the original object.

## Fix Strategy:
The bug can be fixed by calling the `()` method on the weak reference object to obtain a strong reference to the original object before passing it to `_engine_type()`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
