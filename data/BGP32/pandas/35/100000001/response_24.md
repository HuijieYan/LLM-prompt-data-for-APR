The issue with the provided buggy function is that it is attempting to create a weak reference to `self` incorrectly. The `weakref.ref()` function is mistakenly used to create a weak reference to `self`, but it should be used to create a weak reference to an object, not to store a reference to `self` within the function.

To fix this bug:
1. Modify the `_engine` function to properly create a weak reference to `self`.
2. Pass the weak reference of `self` to the `_engine_type` function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self to avoid reference cycle
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `period_ref` is created as a weak reference to `self`, and it is passed to the `_engine_type` function along with the length of `self`. By creating a weak reference to `self` correctly, the potential reference cycle issue is addressed, and the function should work as intended.
