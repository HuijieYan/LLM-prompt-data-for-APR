### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` (which is an instance of some class). However, the intention seems to be passing this weak reference to `_engine_type` to avoid reference cycles, but the implementation is incorrect.

### Identified Potential Error Locations:
1. The weak reference `period` is not being used properly when calling `_engine_type`.
2. The return value of `weakref.ref(self)` should be accessed correctly in the call to `_engine_type`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused because `weakref.ref(self)` returns a callable weak reference object, but the function tries to directly pass this weak reference as an argument to `_engine_type` without invoking it.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
The correct approach is to call the weak reference `period` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This will retrieve the actual reference object it's referring to.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `weakref.ref(self)()` is used to access the actual object that the weak reference is referring to before passing it to `_engine_type`.
