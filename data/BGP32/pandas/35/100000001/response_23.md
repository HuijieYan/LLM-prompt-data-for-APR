The buggy function `_engine` is attempting to create a weak reference to `self` using `weakref.ref(self)`. The intention here is to prevent a reference cycle by using a weak reference. However, the bug lies in the fact that `weakref.ref(self)` is not actually storing the weak reference anywhere, it is just creating it and discarding it immediately without using it in the subsequent code.

To fix this bug, we need to store the weak reference created by `weakref.ref(self)` in a variable and then pass that weak reference to `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

from weakref import ref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we store the weak reference to `self` in the variable `period_ref` and then pass `period_ref` to the `_engine_type` function. This ensures that the weak reference is maintained and used appropriately to prevent reference cycles.
