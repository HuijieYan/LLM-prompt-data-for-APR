## Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference of `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`. However, the issue is that `weakref.ref` creates a weak reference object, not just the reference itself, so passing `period` (which is a weak reference object) to `_engine_type` leads to a mismatched argument type.

## Error locations:
1. Creating a weak reference object using `weakref.ref`.
2. Passing the weak reference object `period` to `_engine_type`.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by passing a weak reference object (`period`) to `_engine_type` instead of a reference to the object itself. This leads to a mismatched argument type error.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
Instead of passing the weak reference object, we should extract the reference from the weak reference object before passing it to `_engine_type`.

## Corrected version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Extract the reference from the weak reference object before passing it to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
