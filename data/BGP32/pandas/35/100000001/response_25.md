The bug in the provided function lies in the way a weak reference of the `self` object is being created and passed to `_engine_type`. The weak reference is not being correctly utilized, and it is causing potential issues with garbage collection and reference cycles.

The cause of the bug is that the `period` variable is being assigned a weak reference object but is not being used correctly in the subsequent function call to `_engine_type`. Weak references should be accessed using the `period()` method to retrieve a strong reference when needed.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly utilize the weak reference. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weak reference of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `period()` is used to retrieve a strong reference from the weak reference object before passing it to `_engine_type`. This ensures that the weak reference is correctly utilized in the function call and prevents potential reference cycle issues.
