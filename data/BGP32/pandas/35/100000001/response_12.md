The buggy function `_engine` is attempting to create a weak reference to the `self` object and then pass this weak reference to the `_engine_type` method. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. The weak reference is being assigned to `period` but is not being used later on.
2. The weak reference should be used when calling `_engine_type`, not the original `self` object.

To fix the bug, we should pass the weak reference `period` instead of `self` to the `_engine_type` method.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we call `period()` to obtain the actual object referenced by the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`.
