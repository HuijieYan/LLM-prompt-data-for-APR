## Analyzing the Bug

The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference of `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`. However, the implementation is incorrect because `weakref.ref` should be used to create a weak reference to an object, not to store it in a variable.

## Error Locations
1. The use of `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference is incorrect.
2. Passing `period` instead of `period()` to `_engine_type`.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by incorrectly using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`. The reference should have been created by `weakref.ref(self)` instead of storing it in a variable `period`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to create a weak reference to `self` using `weakref.ref(self)` and pass this weak reference using `()` when calling `_engine_type`.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```
