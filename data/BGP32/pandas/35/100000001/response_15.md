## Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` and then passing that weak reference to `_engine_type`. The intention seems to be to avoid reference cycles and potential memory leaks.

## Identified Issue:
The issue in the buggy function is that `weakref.ref(self)` is not being dereferenced to access the actual object. It is returning a weak reference object, which then gets passed to `_engine_type`.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because `weakref.ref(self)` returns a weak reference object instead of the actual object. When this weak reference object is passed to `_engine_type`, it is not the original `self` object that is being used as intended.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to dereference the weak reference object to access the actual object before passing it to `_engine_type`. This can be achieved by calling the weak reference object (`period`) to get the actual object referenced.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `weakref.ref(self)()` is used to dereference the weak reference and get the actual `self` object before passing it to `_engine_type`. This ensures that the intended object is being used in the function.
