## Buggy Function Analysis:

The buggy function is a method called `_engine` within a class defined in the file `pandas/core/indexes/period.py`. The function is using a decorator `@cache_readonly`, which implies that the result of this function will be cached and not recomputed on subsequent calls.

Within the function, a weak reference to `self` is created using `weakref.ref(self)`, which is then passed to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`. The intention seems to be to avoid a potential reference cycle issue by using a weak reference.

However, the bug in this function lies in the creation of the weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)`. This line is supposed to create a weak reference to `self`, but it is not used correctly in the subsequent line where `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` is called.

## Bug Explanation:

The bug occurs because the weak reference `period` is created but not properly dereferenced when passing it to `_engine_type`. The weak reference needs to be dereferenced using `period()` before passing it to `_engine_type` to get the actual object.

## Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix the bug, we need to dereference the weak reference `period` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This can be done by calling `period()` to retrieve the actual object. So, the correct way to pass the weak reference should be `self._engine_type(period(), len(self))`.

## Corrected Version:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
