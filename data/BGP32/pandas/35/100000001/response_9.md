### Analysis:
The function `_engine` is meant to return an instance of `self._engine_type`, passing a weak reference of `self` to avoid reference cycles. The use of `weakref.ref(self)` might be causing a potential error as it creates a weak reference object that needs to be dereferenced before use.

### Identified issues:
1. Creating a weak reference object without dereferencing it.
2. Missing dereferencing step for the weak reference object before passing it to `self._engine_type()`.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the weak reference object `period = weakref.ref(self)` is directly being passed to `self._engine_type()` without dereferencing it. This can lead to unexpected behavior as the weak reference needs to be dereferenced to get the actual object.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to dereference the weak reference object before passing it to `self._engine_type()`. This involves using the `()` operator to access the referenced object.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By adding `()` after `weakref.ref(self)`, we dereference the weak reference object, getting the actual object that can be safely passed to `self._engine_type()`.
