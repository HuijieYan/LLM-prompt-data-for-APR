### Analyzing the buggy function:
The buggy function `_engine` is a property getter method that is trying to return an instance of `_engine_type` by passing a weak reference of `self` and the length of `self` to it.

### Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The `weakref.ref(self)` is not being called correctly. It should be passed as an argument to `_engine_type` but is currently being treated as a standalone reference.
2. The `period` variable is not being utilized correctly when passing it to `_engine_type`.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by not correctly handling the weak reference created with `weakref.ref(self)`. This leads to incorrect usage of the weak reference when calling `_engine_type`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to properly use the weak reference created with `weakref.ref(self)` when calling `_engine_type`. We should dereference the weak reference to get the actual object it references before passing it to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we call the weak reference `period` to retrieve the original object before passing it to `_engine_type`. This ensures that the correct object is being passed to `_engine_type`.
