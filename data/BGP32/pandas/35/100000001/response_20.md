The bug in the given function `_engine` is that it is creating a weak reference to `self` and passing it to `_engine_type` function. However, the correct way to use a weak reference with `self` is to call `WeakMethod(self._engine_type)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

from weakref import WeakMethod


@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = WeakMethod(self._engine_type)
    return period(self, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, the function uses `WeakMethod` to create a weak reference to `self._engine_type` function. This will ensure that there are no reference cycles and memory leaks in the program.
