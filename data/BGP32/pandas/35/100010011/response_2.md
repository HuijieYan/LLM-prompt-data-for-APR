### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is supposed to return the engine type for handling operations related to `PeriodIndex`. The bug seems to be related to the weak reference usage in this function. The error message indicates that there is an issue with attribute access (`'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`). This error suggests that the `_engine` is incorrectly returning a `NoneType` object instead of the expected engine type.

### Bug Cause:
1. The `weakref.ref(self)` is creating a weak reference to self but not properly retrieving it back to the original object when used in `_engine_type`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Make sure the weak reference is properly converted back to the original object before returning from the `_engine` function.

### Corrected Code:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By immediately calling the weak reference (`weakref.ref(self)()`) before using it, we ensure that we get the original object referenced by the weak reference. This will fix the issue of returning a `NoneType` object and allow the function to work correctly.
