### Analysis:
The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `self._engine` attribute being set to `NoneType`, leading to an `AttributeError` when trying to call the `view()` method on it. This points to a problem with the `_engine` method in the `PeriodEngine` class.

### Potential Error Location:
The `_engine` method in the `PeriodEngine` class is most likely causing the problem, specifically with how the weak reference is being handled.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped prematurely, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`. This leads to the `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view()` method on a `NoneType`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is retained until it is no longer needed by the `PeriodEngine`. This can be achieved by ensuring that the reference to the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` remains valid throughout the execution of the `_engine` method.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected _engine method
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    self._engines.add(engine)  # Ensures that the engine is retained
    return engine
```

By adding the `self._engines.add(engine)` line, we ensure that the `engine` object is kept in memory until it is no longer needed. This change should resolve the issue and prevent the `AttributeError`.
