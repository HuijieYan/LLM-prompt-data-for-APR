Based on the error message and the GitHub issue description, it is clear that the problem lies in the weak reference handling in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The issue is that the weak reference is not maintained properly, leading to a `NoneType` error when trying to access attributes of the weakly referenced object.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is properly stored and accessed when needed. Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the _engine function
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version above, `period()` is called to retrieve the actual object from the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`. This ensures that we are working with the actual object referenced weakly, rather than a `NoneType`.

By applying this fix, the `PeriodIndex` levels in a `MultiIndex` should maintain their weak references properly, resolving the `NoneType` error and allowing the test to pass successfully.
