### Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` due to a `NoneType` object being accessed for the `.view("i8")` attribute.

The GitHub issue points out that weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` objects are being dropped prematurely, leading to the `NoneType` error when accessing the `_engine` attribute.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the premature dropping of weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` objects, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` object instead of a `PeriodIndex` instance.

### Fix Strategy:
To resolve this bug, we need to ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object remains available when accessed by the `PeriodEngine` to avoid the `NoneType` error. This can be achieved by modifying the `_engine` method to maintain a strong reference to the `PeriodIndex` object during its usage.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the _engine function
def _engine(self):
    # Avoid dropping the weak reference prematurely
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    self._engine_instance = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return self._engine_instance
```

By storing the `_engine_instance` as an attribute of the `PeriodIndex` instance, we maintain a reference to the `PeriodIndex` object until it is no longer needed. This approach ensures that the `PeriodEngine` receives a valid instance instead of `None`, fixing the bug.
