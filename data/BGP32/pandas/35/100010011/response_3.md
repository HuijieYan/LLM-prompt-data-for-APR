### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class is supposed to return the engine type using a weak reference to avoid a reference cycle. The error message indicates an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, pointing towards an issue related to weak reference handling leading to a `None` object being passed where it should not.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the weak reference `period` created using `weakref.ref(self)` is not being used correctly in the `_engine` function. This results in the weak reference being prematurely dropped, leaving the `PeriodEngine` with a `None` object instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is maintained throughout the lifetime of the `_engine` method to prevent it from being prematurely collected. This can be achieved by utilizing the weak reference correctly when creating the `PeriodEngine`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self), self.dtype)
```

In the corrected version:
- The weak reference `period` is now passed correctly to `_engine_type`.
- The weak reference is maintained within the scope of the `_engine` method to prevent premature collection.

By making these changes, the bug causing the `NoneType` error should be resolved, and the corrected function should behave as intended.
