### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is creating a weak reference to `self`, which is a `PeriodIndex` instance, and passing this weak reference to `_engine_type` to create an engine object. The issue arises because the weak reference `period` is not being used correctly. The `PeriodEngine` is not receiving the proper reference to `self`, resulting in a `NoneType` object when trying to access its attributes.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect usage of weak references in `_engine`.
2. The `PeriodEngine` is not receiving a valid reference due to the weak reference usage.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from how the weak reference `period` is created and used in `_engine`. When `self` is weakly referenced, it is not passed correctly to `_engine_type`, leading to a `NoneType` object where an actual `PeriodIndex` reference is expected. This causes an `AttributeError` when trying to access attributes of the `PeriodIndex`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
The correct approach would be to use the weak reference correctly in a way that allows the `PeriodEngine` to receive a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
# It handles the weak reference creation and usage properly

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we create a proxy instead of a weak reference that allows `_engine_type` to receive a valid reference to `self`.

This correction should resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report and pass the failing test.
