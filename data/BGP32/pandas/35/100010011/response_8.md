### Analysis:
The issue seems to be related to weak referencing of the `PeriodIndex` object within the `_engine` function in the `pandas.core.indexes.period` module. The error message indicates that a `NoneType` object is being accessed, leading to an `AttributeError`.

### Identified issue:
The issue arises due to the weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` inside the `_engine` function potentially being collected before it's used in `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.

### Bug Cause:
The weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` might be garbage collected before it's utilized in `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, leading to a `NoneType` object being accessed.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` remains valid until it's used in `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference in a local variable within the `_engine` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference in a local variable to prevent garbage collection
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

By storing the `weakref.ref(self)` in `period_ref` before returning `self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))`, we ensure the weak reference remains valid until it's used.
