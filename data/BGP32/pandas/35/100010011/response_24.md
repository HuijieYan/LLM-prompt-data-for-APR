### Analysis:
- The `_engine` function in the buggy code is supposed to return a weak reference of `self` to avoid reference cycles.
- The error message indicates an `AttributeError` due to a `NoneType` object when trying to access the `.view("i8")` attribute.
- The GitHub issue mentions that weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped prematurely.
- The error occurs when trying to access the `PeriodEngine` in a `MultiIndex` object.

### Error Cause:
- The weak reference `period` created in the `_engine` function is not being properly maintained, leading to premature dropping of the reference.
- When attempting to access the `PeriodEngine` using the weak reference, it results in a `NoneType` object, causing the `AttributeError`.

### Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, the weak reference creation should be handled correctly to ensure that the reference is maintained throughout the `_engine` function's execution.
- We need to ensure that the weak reference is used correctly to avoid `NoneType` errors when accessing related objects.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine_type
``` 

By providing a corrected version that correctly uses the weak reference created and ensures its usage within the function, the bug should be resolved, and the test should pass without raising an `AttributeError`.
