### Analysis:
1. The `_engine` function is supposed to return the `_engine_type` with a weak reference to `self` (PeriodIndex).
2. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` because the `_engine` is returning `NoneType` instead of the expected `PeriodEngine`.
3. The bug causes the weak reference `period` to be created but not used correctly, resulting in the `_engine` function returning `None`, leading to the `AttributeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is passed to `_engine_type` correctly.

### Bug Fix:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` with parentheses, we retrieve the original object from the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`. This ensures that the weak reference is correctly utilized, preventing the function from returning `None` and resolving the `AttributeError`.

Now, when the `test_get_level_values_when_periods` test is run, it should pass without the `AttributeError`.
