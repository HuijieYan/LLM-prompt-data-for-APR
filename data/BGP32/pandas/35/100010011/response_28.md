### Analysis:
The error message indicates that there is an issue in the `pandas/_libs/index.pyx` file where the `return super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter().view("i8")` line is trying to access an attribute of a `NoneType` object, which leads to the `AttributeError`.

### Error Location:
The issue is related to the weak reference handling in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodEngine` class.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` instance is getting dropped before it's intended to be accessed in the `_engine` method. This leads to the `_engine` method receiving a `None` object instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance is held until needed within the `_engine` method.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    class PeriodEngine:
        def __init__(self, period, length):
            self.period = period
            self.length = length
        
        def is_monotonic_increasing(self):
            obj = self.period()
            if obj is not None:
                # Access the necessary methods or attributes using the weak reference obj
                return obj.is_monotonic_increasing
            else:
                return False

    return PeriodEngine(period, len(self))
```

This corrected version ensures that the weakly referenced `self` object (period) is accessed correctly within the `PeriodEngine` class, preventing the `NoneType` attribute error when accessing the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object.
