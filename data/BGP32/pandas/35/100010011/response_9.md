### Analysis:
- The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` (presumably an instance of some class), which might lead to the referenced object being garbage-collected.
- The error message indicates that the PeriodEngine is receiving a `None` object instead of the intended PeriodIndex, causing the AttributeError when trying to access an attribute of `None`.

### Bug Cause:
- The weak reference created in the `_engine` function is not properly handled, which might lead to the referenced object being garbage-collected and replaced with `None`. This results in the AttributeError when trying to access an attribute on `None`.

### Strategy for Bug Fix:
- A potential solution is to maintain a strong reference to the object that the weak reference is pointing to until it is no longer needed. This can prevent the object from being garbage-collected prematurely.

### Bug Fix:
```python
from pandas.core.indexes.base import keepref
from pandas.util._decorators import Appender, cache_readonly, doc

# Fix the buggy function by maintaining a strong reference to the weak reference target
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    keepref(period, self)  # Maintain a strong reference
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this fix, the strong reference to the `period` object is maintained, preventing it from being garbage-collected prematurely. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the intended object is passed to the `PeriodEngine` without any AttributeError.
