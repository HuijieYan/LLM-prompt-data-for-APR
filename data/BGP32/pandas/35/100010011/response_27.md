### Analysis:
1. The provided buggy function `_engine` is utilizing `weakref.ref()` to create a weak reference to `self` which should be passed to `_engine_type` function to avoid reference cycles.
2. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` on 'NoneType' object which suggests that the weak reference created using `weakref.ref()` might not be working as expected leading to a `NoneType`.
3. The GitHub issue describes that weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped prematurely causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of `PeriodIndex`.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference created using `weakref.ref()` is correctly implemented and passed to `_engine_type` without being dropped prematurely.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Change the way weak reference is created and used to ensure it stays valid.
2. Ensure that the weak reference is properly utilized in the `_engine_type` function without losing its reference.
3. Modify the `_engine` function to handle weak reference creation and usage correctly to avoid the `NoneType` error.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to 'self'
    weak_ref = weakref.proxy(self)
    
    # Pass the weak reference to _engine_type
    return self._engine_type(weak_ref, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy()` instead of `weakref.ref()`, we can ensure that a valid weak reference is maintained throughout the `_engine` function's usage. This corrected version should resolve the `NoneType` error and pass the failing test case.
