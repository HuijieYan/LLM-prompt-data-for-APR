### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is responsible for returning the engine type associated with the current object.
2. The error message is related to an `AttributeError`, pointing to a `NoneType` object having no attribute 'view'.
3. The bug is causing the `_engine` to return `None` instead of the expected engine type, leading to the error when trying to access the 'view' attribute.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is properly created and maintained for the `self` object.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Instead of directly assigning `weakref.ref(self)` to `period`, we need to call it as a function to create a weak reference properly.
2. Ensure that the weak reference `period` is not lost before accessing it inside the `_engine` function.
   
### Corrected Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference properly
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    # Check if the weak reference is still valid
    if period() is None:
        # Handle the case where the weak reference is no longer valid
        raise RuntimeError("Weak reference to self is no longer valid")
    
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By modifying the function to properly create and maintain the weak reference, we can prevent the `None` object from being returned as the engine, effectively resolving the bug.
