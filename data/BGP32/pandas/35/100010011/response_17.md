### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `period.py` file is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` which is a `Period` object.
2. The error message indicates that an `AttributeError` occurs because a `NoneType` object is encountered when trying to access the `view` attribute.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the problem of weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped prematurely, leading to the `NoneType` error.
4. The `PeriodEngine` is not receiving the expected `PeriodIndex` due to weak reference handling issues.
  
### Bug Cause:
The weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is not appropriately managed in the `_engine` function, causing a premature drop of the reference and resulting in a `NoneType` object being accessed later in the code.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly maintained throughout the `_engine` function.
2. Adjust the weak reference handling to prevent premature dropping of the reference before the intended use.
3. Validate the `PeriodIndex` object being passed to the `PeriodEngine` to avoid `NoneType` errors.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))

```
