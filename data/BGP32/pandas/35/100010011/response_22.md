#### Analysis:
The provided buggy function `_engine` in the `period.py` file is not correctly creating a weak reference. Due to this incorrect implementation, the `PeriodEngine` is receiving `None` instead of a valid reference leading to the `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error when accessing the values.

The GitHub issue reports a scenario where `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` lose weak references, causing issues with monotonicity checks.

#### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from how the weak reference to the `self` object is created inside the `_engine` function. The `weakref.ref(self)` should preserve a reference to `self` weakly, but the implementation in the buggy function does not achieve this, leading to losing the weak reference.

#### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the weak reference creation needs to be correctly implemented to ensure that a valid weak reference to the `self` object is passed to `_engine_type`.

#### Corrected Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Correctly create a weak reference of self to avoid reference cycle
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By correcting the creation of a weak reference in the `_engine` function, the issue of losing weak references to `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` should be resolved, and the monotonicity checks should work correctly as expected.
