### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self` (a PeriodIndex object). The intention is to prevent reference cycles. However, the bug occurs because the weak reference is not being properly utilized when creating the `_engine` object.

### Identified Bug:
The bug occurs when the weak reference `period` is returned directly to `_engine_type`, which does not handle the weak reference properly. This leads to the `_engine` object being created with a None instead of a valid PeriodIndex object, causing the AttributeError during further processing.

### Bug Cause:
1. The weak reference `period` should not be passed directly to `_engine_type` as it needs to be accessed correctly to obtain the original reference object.
2. Since a weak reference is being used, `period` needs to be dereferenced properly before being passed to `_engine_type`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the weak reference `period` should be dereferenced correctly before passing it to `_engine_type`. This will ensure that the original object (`self`) is used in the creation of the `_engine` object.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Dereference the weak reference to obtain the original object before passing it to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    
    # Check if the original object is still available after dereferencing
    if period is not None:
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        raise ValueError("Weak reference to PeriodIndex is invalid.")
```

This corrected version properly dereferences the weak reference to obtain the original `self` object before passing it to `_engine_type`. Additionally, it includes a check to ensure that the dereferenced object is valid before creating the `_engine` object. This fix should resolve the AttributeError issue and allow the test to pass successfully.
