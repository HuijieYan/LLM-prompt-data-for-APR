### Analysis:
- The error message indicates that the 'PeriodEngine' is receiving a 'NoneType' object instead of a 'PeriodIndex', leading to an 'AttributeError' when trying to access the 'view' attribute.
- The function `_engine` in the buggy code is supposed to create a weak reference to the 'self' object and pass it to `_engine_type` to avoid reference cycles.
- The cause of the bug is that the weak reference is not being properly created in the `_engine` function, resulting in the 'NoneType' object being passed to the `_engine_type`.

### Fix Strategy:
- Ensure that a valid weak reference is created and passed to `_engine_type`.
- Use the `weakref.proxy` method to create a weak reference to 'self' before passing it to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference using weakref.proxy
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy` to create a weak reference to 'self', we ensure that a valid weak reference is passed to `_engine_type`, resolving the issue of receiving a 'NoneType' object.
