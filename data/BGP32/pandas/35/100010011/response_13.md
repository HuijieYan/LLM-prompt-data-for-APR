### Analysis:
The provided buggy function `_engine` is supposed to return the engine type using a weak reference of self. However, the issue arises when the weak reference of `self` is passed to `_engine_type` which leads to the engine returning `NoneType`, causing attribute errors during execution.

The GitHub issue describes the problem when weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

### Error Cause:
The error occurs when the weak reference is not maintained properly, leading to the engine type returning `None`. The weakly referenced object is getting lost prematurely, resulting in the `NoneType` object error.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained correctly until it is used by the `_engine_type`. This can be done by adjusting how the weak reference is created and handled in the `_engine` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, we maintain a reference to `self` until it is used by `_engine_type`. This will prevent premature deletion of the weakly referenced object causing the `NoneType` error.
