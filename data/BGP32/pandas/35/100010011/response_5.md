### Analyzing the bug:

The error message indicates an `AttributeError` with `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, which suggests that a `NoneType` object is being accessed as if it had an attribute named 'view'. This error likely occurs in the `_engine` function where a weak reference to `self` is created but not properly utilized. The GitHub issue further corroborates that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped prematurely.

### Bug explanation:

The bug lies in the way the weak reference to `self` is created and used in the `_engine` function. Creating a weak reference using `weakref.ref(self)` returns a weak reference to `self` but doesn't properly maintain the reference to prevent it from being garbage collected before it is used within `_engine_type`. This premature garbage collection results in the `self` reference becoming `None`, leading to the `AttributeError` when trying to access attributes of a `NoneType` object.

### Bug fixing strategy:

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly maintained throughout the `_engine` function's lifetime. One way to achieve this is by creating a proxy object that holds the weak reference while allowing access to the actual object's attributes when needed.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    class WeakRefProxy:
        def __init__(self, ref):
            self._ref = ref

        def __getattr__(self, item):
            return getattr(self._ref(), item)

    weak_self = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(WeakRefProxy(weak_self), len(self))
```

By using the `WeakRefProxy` class, we maintain the weak reference to `self` and access its attributes through the proxy object, preventing premature garbage collection. This corrected version should resolve the `AttributeError` issue.
