### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` seems to create a weak reference `period` of `self` which is later used to pass to `_engine_type` for further processing. The bug seems to arise from the weak reference handling that results in `NoneType` object being passed to `self._engine_type`.

The GitHub issue points out the problem of losing weakrefs when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`, which leads to the error message.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to the weak reference setup in the `_engine` function, which results in `NoneType` being passed to `_engine_type`, causing the AttributeError when accessing the `view` method.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference setup is correctly handled and passed to `_engine_type` without leading to a `NoneType` object. This can involve adjusting how the weak reference is created and used in the `_engine` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Correct weakref usage by creating a strong reference within the function scope
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    indexed_values = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if indexed_values is None:
        return None
    return indexed_values
```

By creating a strong reference `indexed_values` within the function and checking if it is `None`, we ensure that we handle the weak reference appropriately in the corrected version. This change should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and pass the failing test.
