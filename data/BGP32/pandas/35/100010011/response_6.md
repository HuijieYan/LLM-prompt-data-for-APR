### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is missing the creation of a weak reference using `weakref.ref(self)`. This leads to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not correctly creating a weak reference to `self` in the `_engine` function. This results in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`, leading to the AttributeError.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly create a weak reference to `self` using `weakref.ref(self)` in the `_engine` function.

### Corrected Code:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Correctly create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By creating a weak reference to `self` with `period = weakref.ref(self)`, we ensure that the referenced object is kept alive during the function call. Then, calling `period()` will return the original object that `self` refers to, resolving the issue of receiving a `None`.
