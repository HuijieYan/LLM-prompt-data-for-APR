### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is a decorator function `@cache_readonly` which returns the engine type using a weak reference of `self`. The issue is related to weak referencing behavior causing a NoneType error.

### Error:
The error occurs because the weak reference to the object `self` is not being properly maintained. This leads to a situation where the weak reference is None, which results in an AttributeError when trying to access attributes of the weakly referenced object.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Instead of using a weak reference to `self`, maintain a strong reference by assigning `self` directly to the variable.
2. Ensure that the correct engine type is instantiated with the required parameters.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By directly passing `self` to the engine type, we maintain a strong reference and avoid the weak referencing issue that caused the NoneType error. This correction should resolve the bug and allow the test case to pass successfully.
