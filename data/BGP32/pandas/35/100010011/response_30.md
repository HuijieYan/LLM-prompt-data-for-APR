### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is trying to create a weak reference to `self` (which is an instance of a class) and pass it to `_engine_type`. The weak reference creation seems to be incorrect, leading to the error message about a `NoneType` object not having the attribute 'view'. This error is likely triggered in the code that is expected to handle weak references.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect creation of the weak reference `period` in the `_engine` function. The weak reference should be created to refer to the actual object `self`, but the current implementation creates a weak reference to the weak reference object itself (`weakref.ref(self)`). This results in the weak reference being invalid and eventually leading to the `NoneType` attribute error.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly create a weak reference to the object `self` in the `_engine` function. This will ensure that the weak reference maintains a valid reference to the object and resolves the issue caused by passing a `NoneType` object.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Correct weak reference creation to point to the actual object 'self'
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By updating the weak reference creation to `period()`, we are now correctly creating a weak reference to the `self` object. This change should resolve the issue related to weak reference handling and prevent the `NoneType` attribute error.
