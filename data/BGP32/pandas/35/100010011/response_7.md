### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`. However, the issue arises when `_engine_type` attempts to access this weak reference but receives a `None` value instead of the `PeriodIndex` object, leading to the `AttributeError`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the premature dropping of the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object before it is intended to be used by `PeriodEngine`. This results in `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` object instead of the actual `PeriodIndex`, causing the `AttributeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained until it is accessed by `PeriodEngine` within the `_engine_type`. This can be achieved by updating the `_engine` function to store the weak reference within the `self` object itself, ensuring it does not get garbage-collected prematurely.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference within self to prevent premature garbage collection
    self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference within `self` as `_period_weakref`, we ensure that the `PeriodIndex` object stays alive until it is accessed by `_engine_type`. This change will prevent the `NoneType` error from occurring.

After applying this correction, rerun the failing test case to ensure that the bug has been resolved successfully.
