### Analysis:
The provided `_engine` function returns a weak reference of `self`, which is then utilized to instantiate the `_engine_type`. The issue arises from the weak reference object not being handled correctly, leading to a `NoneType` error when trying to access its attributes.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes an attribute error when trying to access the `view()` method on a `NoneType` object. This occurs due to potential issues with weak referencing handling in the `_engine` function.

### Fix Strategy:
To resolve this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference handling is correctly maintained, and the expected type is securely retrieved from the weak reference object.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Make a weakref and keep a reference to the object to prevent it from being garbage collected too soon
    weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    period = weak_period()
    
    if period is None:
        raise ValueError("Weak reference was lost.")
    
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By properly checking the weak reference object and ensuring it's not `None`, we can avoid the AttributeError raised in the failing test. This corrected version handles the weak reference appropriately and should fix the bug.
