### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` in the `pandas` library's `PeriodIndex` class is utilizing a weak reference with the intent to avoid a reference cycle. However, the weak reference is not being properly utilized, leading to a `NoneType` error when trying to access an attribute on the object it references. This results in the failing test mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. In the `_engine` function, the weak reference `period` is created but not being correctly utilized when passing it to `_engine_type`.
2. The weak reference is not being accessed appropriately when trying to create the `PeriodEngine` object.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises due to the mishandling of the weak reference `period` which results in a `NoneType` object being returned instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`. This error occurs when attempting to access an attribute that is not present on a `NoneType` object.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Utilize the weak reference `period` correctly to ensure that the `PeriodIndex` object is retained and accessible in `_engine_type`.
2. Verify that the weak reference has not been deallocated before accessing it within the `PeriodEngine`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))  # Access the weak reference using `period()`
```

By correctly accessing the weak reference using `period()` before passing it to `_engine_type`, the bug can be fixed, and the error causing the failing test in the GitHub issue can be resolved.
