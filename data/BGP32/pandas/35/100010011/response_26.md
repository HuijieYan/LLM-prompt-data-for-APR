### Analysis:
The bug occurs when the `_engine` method in the `PeriodIndex` class returns a weakly referenced Period object that is not maintained properly, resulting in a `NoneType` error when accessing the engine's `view("i8")` attribute. This causes the test to fail due to a missing attribute issue.

### Bug Location:
- The weak reference creation in the `_engine` method may not be retaining the reference to the Period object properly, leading to a `NoneType` error.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the weak reference mechanism used in the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class. The weak reference to the `Period` object is not maintained throughout the method call, resulting in a `None` reference when trying to access the `view("i8")` attribute.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference created in the `_engine` method maintains a reference to the `Period` object throughout the method call. This can be achieved by properly handling the weak reference or ensuring that the `Period` object is still available when accessing attributes of the engine.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Updated and corrected _engine method
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))

# Corrected Version:
def _engine_type(period, length):
    engine = PeriodEngine(period, length)
    return engine
```

By maintaining the reference correctly, the `PeriodEngine` should now have access to the `Period` object without raising a `NoneType` error when accessing attributes. This correction should resolve the issue and allow the test case to pass successfully.
