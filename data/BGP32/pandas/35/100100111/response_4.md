## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is a `PeriodIndex` instance.
2. The `_engine` function is expected to return the result of calling `self._engine_type` with the weakly referenced `self` and the length of `self`.
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` instance `idx` with a `PeriodIndex` containing two `Period` instances.
4. The test then creates `idx2` by getting level values from `idx` and asserts that all the levels are monotonic, which fails due to the issue described in GitHub requesting to retain the weak reference properly.
5. The expected input values are a `PeriodIndex` instance and a `PeriodArray`.

## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_engine` function is that it creates a weak reference to `self` but does not properly use it when calling `self._engine_type`. This results in passing `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is dereferenced correctly when calling `self._engine_type`. This can be achieved by using the `.dereference()` method of the weak reference object.

## Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period.dereference(), len(self))
```
