Based on the provided information, the issue seems to stem from the weak reference `period` being utilized improperly in the `_engine` function. The weak reference `period` is created but not correctly passed to `_engine_type`, leading to potential `None` values being passed instead of the desired `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, the weak reference `period` should be accessed properly before passing it to `_engine_type`. We should ensure that the weak reference does not get prematurely dropped, maintaining the reference to `self`.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` instead of directly passing `period` to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the weak reference is accessed to get the actual reference to `self`. This correction should address the issue highlighted in the failing test case and preserve the expected behavior of the function.

Please incorporate this fix into the codebase to resolve the bug and ensure the function behaves as expected.
