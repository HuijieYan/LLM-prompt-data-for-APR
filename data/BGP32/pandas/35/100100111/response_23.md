### Analysis
- The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is a part of a `PeriodIndex` object.
- The test case `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` object from a `PeriodIndex` and checks if all levels are monotonic.
- The issue on GitHub highlights the problem where weak referencing of `PeriodIndex` is lost, resulting in `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

### Bug Cause
- The bug is caused by the weak reference not being maintained properly, leading to the weak reference being lost prematurely.
- When creating `period = weakref.ref(self)`, the weak reference is not kept alive beyond the scope of the function, causing it to be collected before usage.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Create a strong reference to the weak reference object before returning it to keep the weak reference alive.
2. Use the `reference` object to get the original `self` object when needed.

### Corrected Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Keep a strong reference to the weak reference object
    reference = weakref.ref(self)
    
    def engine_type_wrapper():
        return self._engine_type(reference(), len(self))
    
    return engine_type_wrapper
```

By returning a closure `engine_type_wrapper` that captures a strong reference to the weak reference, we ensure that the weak reference remains valid until it is accessed inside the wrapper function.
