### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference of the `self` variable. However, it seems that the weak reference is not being properly utilized when passed to `_engine_type`. This behavior is causing an issue in the `test_get_level_values_when_periods` test function because the weak reference is not being handled correctly.

### Identified Bug
The bug lies in the way the weak reference `period` is being passed to `_engine_type`. This results in `_engine_type` receiving a `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is properly utilized when passed to `_engine_type`. This may involve checking for `None` values or adjusting how the weak reference is handled internally.

### Bug-free Version of the Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period() if period() is not None else self, len(self))
```

With this correction, we are checking if the weak reference `period()` is not `None` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This ensures that the `PeriodIndex` is correctly passed to `_engine_type` without losing the weak reference.
