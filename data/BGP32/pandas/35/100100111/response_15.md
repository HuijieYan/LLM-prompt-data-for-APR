## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference of the `self` object before passing it to `_engine_type`. The issue seems to be related to the weak reference not being maintained properly, causing the `period` to be deleted prematurely.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is checking if all levels in the `idx2` object are monotonic. However, due to the premature deletion of the weak reference, the `idx2` object may not have the expected behavior, leading to the test failure.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the premature deletion of the weak reference created using `weakref.ref(self)`. When the `_engine_type` function is trying to access the weakly referenced object, it may have already been deleted, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference created with `weakref.ref(self)` remains valid until it is actually needed by the `_engine_type` function. One way to achieve this is by storing the weak reference in a variable that has a longer lifetime than the current function call scope.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference in a variable with a longer lifetime
    self_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self_weakref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference in `self_weakref` before passing it to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the weak reference remains valid until it is actually used by `_engine_type`. This fix addresses the premature deletion issue and should make the function behave as expected.

Now, after applying this fix, the function should work correctly and pass the failing test provided.
