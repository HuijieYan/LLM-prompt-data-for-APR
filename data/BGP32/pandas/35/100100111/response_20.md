### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This weak reference mechanism is intended to avoid reference cycles. However, the issue lies in the fact that the weak reference to `self` is not being correctly utilized later in the function, resulting in potential loss of reference to the original object.

### Error Location:
The error is in the line:
```python
period = weakref.ref(self)
```
The variable `period` is intended to hold a weak reference to `self`, but it is not used correctly in the subsequent code.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object to be lost before it's intended, leading `PeriodEngine` to receive None instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This loss of reference results in incorrect behavior and potential errors later in the code.

### Fix Strategy:
The fix should involve correctly utilizing the weak reference object `period` within the `_engine` function before passing it to `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. Ensure that the weak reference is appropriately used to maintain the reference to the original object `self`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` to get the original object from the weak reference within the `_engine` function before passing it to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the weak reference is correctly utilized to maintain the reference to the original `PeriodIndex` object.
