### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` in the `period.py` file is using `weakref.ref` to pass a weak reference of `self` to the `_engine_type` method. The issue arises from the fact that the `period` variable is being incorrectly assigned as a weak reference to `self`, and this weak reference is then passed to `_engine_type`.

The failing test case `test_get_level_values_when_periods` in the `test_get_level_values.py` file involves creating a `MultiIndex` with `PeriodIndex` objects. However, due to the bug in the `_engine` function, weak references are not being handled correctly, resulting in a failure when checking the monotonicity of the levels in the `MultiIndex`.

### Error location:
The error is in the following line within the `_engine` function:
```python
period = weakref.ref(self)
```
Here, `period` is assigned a weak reference to `self`, which is not correctly utilized for passing to `_engine_type`.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug causes the weak reference to `self` (PeriodIndex) to get lost before being passed to `_engine_type`. This results in `_engine_type` receiving `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`, leading to unexpected behavior and failures in the test case.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, `weakref.ref` should not be used directly to create a weak reference to `self`. Instead, we can utilize `weakref.proxy` to create a proxy object that maintains a weak reference to `self` without the need to call `ref` explicitly.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use weakref.proxy to pass a weak reference of self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we can maintain a weak reference to `self` without losing it prematurely. This corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test case.
