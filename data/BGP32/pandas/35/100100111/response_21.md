### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using a `cache_readonly` decorator, indicating that it caches the result to improve performance.
2. The function uses `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` (PeriodIndex object) and uses it in `_engine_type`.
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` aims to check if a PeriodIndex retains weakrefs correctly when involved in creating a MultiIndex.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the problem where weakly referenced PeriodIndex is dropped prematurely, leading to None being passed to the PeriodEngine.

### Error location
The issue lies in the premature dropping of the weakly referenced PeriodIndex (`period`) before it is passed to `_engine_type`.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the weak reference `period` is created inside the `_engine` function and then stored locally. However, there is no guarantee that the weak reference remains alive when `_engine_type` is called, leading to a None value being passed instead of the intended PeriodIndex.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` remains alive until it is used in `_engine_type`. This can be achieved by creating a class-level weak reference attribute that persists throughout the object's lifecycle.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
# The corrected version of the function
class PeriodIndex:
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Create a class-level weak reference
        self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we create a class-level weak reference `self._period_weakref` to ensure that the weak reference remains alive while being used in `_engine_type`. This modification addresses the premature dropping of weak references and resolves the bug.
