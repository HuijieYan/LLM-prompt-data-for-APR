### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type` constructor. The intention is to avoid a reference cycle.
- The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is testing the behavior of `MultiIndex.from_arrays` with `PeriodIndex` values. The test expects the `is_monotonic` property of levels to be `True`.
- The GitHub issue indicates that weak references are being lost, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of `PeriodIndex`.

### Error:
- The weak reference to `self` is not being properly maintained, leading to its loss before being passed to `_engine_type`.

### Fix Strategy:
- Ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until it's passed to `_engine_type`.
- Modify the `_engine` function to correctly handle weak referencing of `self`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

With the corrected implementation above, the weak reference to `self` will be maintained properly until it's passed to `_engine_type`, resolving the issue identified in the failing test and GitHub.
