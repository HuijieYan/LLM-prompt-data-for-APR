## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to store a weak reference to `self` but doesn't properly handle weak references in its current state. This leads to a situation where `period` is a weak reference object instead of a reference to `self`, causing issues when `_engine_type` tries to use it.

The failing test case `test_get_level_values_when_periods` aims to ensure that the levels created from a MultiIndex are monotonic. However, due to the bug in the `_engine` function, weak references are not handled correctly and result in errors during the test execution.

The GitHub issue points out that copying levels on a MultiIndex loses weak references, causing unexpected behavior in the test case.

## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_engine` function is that `period = weakref.ref(self)` should be `period = weakref.proxy(self)` to create a weak proxy reference to `self` instead of a weak reference. This change ensures that `_engine` is passed a valid reference to `self` when calling `_engine_type`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update `weakref.ref(self)` to `weakref.proxy(self)` so that the weak reference is a proxy reference to `self` instead of a weak reference object. This change will ensure that `_engine_type` receives a valid reference to `self` and resolves the weak reference issue.

def _engine(self):

    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
