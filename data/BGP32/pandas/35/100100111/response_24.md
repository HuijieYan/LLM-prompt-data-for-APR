To address the bug in the `_engine` function, we need to ensure that the weak reference object `period` is maintained until the engine is utilized. The bug currently arises from the premature dropping of the weak reference object before it is used.

The fix involves storing the weak reference `period` within the `_engine` function until `self._engine_type` is executed. By doing this, we prevent the reference cycle from causing issues with garbage collection prematurely.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Storing the weak reference object within this function
    self._weak_period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._weak_period_ref, len(self))
```

This fix ensures that the weak reference object `period` is preserved until it is actually utilized within `self._engine_type`, resolving the bug that caused the function to fail.

After applying this fix, the provided failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` should pass successfully.
