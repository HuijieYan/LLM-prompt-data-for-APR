## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` in the `period.py` file is using `weakref.ref(self)` to pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`. This approach is causing issues as the weak reference might be lost before intended, leading to `None` being passed to `_engine_type`.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` involves creating a `PeriodIndex` and then retrieving level values from a `MultiIndex` created from the original `PeriodIndex`. The test asserts that the levels are monotonic, but due to the weak reference issue, this test fails.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the use of `weakref.ref(self)` in the `_engine` function. When the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped prematurely, it results in passing `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex` to `_engine_type`. This behavior leads to unexpected behavior observed in the failing test.

## Solution Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference remains until it is needed by `_engine_type`. We can achieve this by storing the weak reference as an attribute of the `self` instance. By doing this, we guarantee that the weak reference does not get dropped prematurely.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference as an attribute of the self instance
    self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
``` 

By storing the weak reference as `self._period_weakref`, we ensure that the reference remains valid until it is used by `_engine_type`, resolving the issue of passing `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
