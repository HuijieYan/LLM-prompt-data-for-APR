## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine(self)` is utilizing `weakref` to create a weak reference to `self` and pass it to `_engine_type`. The expected behavior is to avoid reference cycles.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods()` is failing due to a weak reference issue when creating `MultiIndex` objects, causing `idx2.levels` to contain `None`, leading to the assertion failure.
3. The bug occurs because the weak reference `period` in the `_engine` function is not being used correctly, resulting in the engine receiving `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly passed to `_engine_type`.
5. A corrected version of the function will need to properly handle the weak reference creation and usage.

## Bug Fix
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By modifying the function to call `period()` before passing it to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the weak-referenced object is correctly utilized, resolving the issue of receiving `None`. This change allows the correct reference to be passed to `_engine_type`, preventing the bug from occurring.
