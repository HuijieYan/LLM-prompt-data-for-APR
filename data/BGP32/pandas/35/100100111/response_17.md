## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object, which is a `PeriodIndex` instance. The weak reference is then passed to `_engine_type`. However, the problem arises because the weak reference is not maintained correctly, leading to a `None` being passed to `_engine_type` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

## Error Location
The bug is likely in the creation of the weak reference to `self` using `weakref.ref(self)`. The weak reference mechanism is not properly implemented in this context, leading to the weak reference being lost before passing it to `_engine_type`.

## Bug Cause
The bug causes the weak reference `period` to be dropped too early, resulting in passing `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex` to `_engine_type`. This incorrect behavior is triggered when trying to access the levels of `idx2` in the failing test.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until it is passed to `_engine_type`. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference in a variable accessible by the function.

## Corrected Function
```python
# The corrected version of the function

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Maintain the weak reference throughout the function
    self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference in `self._period_weakref` within the `_engine` function, we can ensure that the weak reference is maintained until it is passed to `_engine_type`. This correction should resolve the issue and allow the function to work correctly with the failing test.
