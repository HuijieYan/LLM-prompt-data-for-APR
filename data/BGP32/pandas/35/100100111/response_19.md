The bug in the `_engine` function is that it is creating a weak reference to `self` but not handling the weak reference properly. 

Here is the fix for the bug:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use weakref.proxy to create a weak reference
    # This allows accessing the original object without the need to call .() method
    # This fix ensures that a weak reference to self is maintained correctly
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, the function can correctly maintain a weak reference to `self` without losing access to the original object. This change should resolve the bug and allow the test to pass as expected.
