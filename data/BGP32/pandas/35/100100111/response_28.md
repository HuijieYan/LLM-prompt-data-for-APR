## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using weak reference `weakref.ref(self)` to avoid reference cycles but not handling it properly. The issue seems to be related to the weak reference being dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive `None` instead of the PeriodIndex.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because when the weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` is created, it does not keep a strong reference to `self`. As a result, when `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` is called, `period` might get garbage collected, leading to `None` being passed instead of the actual `self`. This behavior causes the failure in the test case.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` created in the `_engine` method remains valid until it is used in `_engine_type`. One way to achieve this is by storing the weak reference as a class attribute to keep a strong reference to it as long as the instance exists.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

def _engine(self):
    self._cached_period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._cached_period_ref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference as `self._cached_period_ref` at the class level, we ensure that the reference remains valid until it is used in `_engine_type`. This correction should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
