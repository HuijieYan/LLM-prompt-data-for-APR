### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` (a `PeriodIndex` object) and then passing it to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`. However, the `weakref.ref()` function does not return the referenced object directly, it returns a callable that returns the referenced object when called. This causes an issue as `period` should actually be called before passing it to `_engine_type`.

### Bug Explanation
- The bug in the current function is that it is passing a weak reference object (`period`) to `_engine_type` instead of the actual object being referenced.
- In the failing test, when the `idx2` is created using `idx._get_level_values(level)`, the weak reference is not resolving correctly, resulting in incorrect behavior.
- The expected behavior is that the weak reference should resolve correctly and pass the referenced object (`self`) to `_engine_type`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the weak reference needs to be resolved using the callable returned by `weakref.ref()` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This can be achieved by calling `period()` to get the actual referenced object.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By calling `period()` after creating the weak reference, we resolve the weak reference to get the actual `self` object before passing it to `_engine_type`. This correction should ensure that the weak reference is resolved correctly in the `_engine` function.
