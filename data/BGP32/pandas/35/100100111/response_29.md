## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is a `PeriodIndex` instance. The bug is likely related to the weak reference not being properly passed to `_engine_type` causing it to receive `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

## Potential Error Locations
- The weak reference creation using `weakref.ref(self)`.
- Passing the weak reference to `_engine_type`.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the weak reference not being properly utilized within the `_engine` function. As a result, the `_engine_type` function receives `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex` instance, leading to incorrect behavior as observed in the failing test case.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is correctly passed to `_engine_type` for it to receive the `PeriodIndex` instance. This can be achieved by properly utilizing the weak reference created in the `_engine` function.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref(), len(self))
```

With this corrected version, the weak reference is correctly dereferenced using `period_ref()` before passing it to `_engine_type`, ensuring that the `PeriodIndex` instance is properly provided to the engine. This should resolve the issue and pass the failing test case.
