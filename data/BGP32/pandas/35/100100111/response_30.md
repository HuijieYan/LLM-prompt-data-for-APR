## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using a `weakref` to avoid reference cycles in the Pandas code related to PeriodIndex. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that weak references are being dropped prematurely, leading to a `None` being passed to the `PeriodEngine`, causing unexpected behavior.

## Identification of Potential Errors
1. The creation of `period` as a weak reference using `weakref.ref(self)` might not retain the reference properly.
2. Passing the weak reference `period` to `_engine_type` might not be properly handled.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs due to premature dropping of the weak reference in the `_engine` function. As a result, when the `_engine_type` is called with a weakly referenced PeriodIndex, it receives a `None` instead of the actual PeriodIndex instance.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is held until it is no longer needed for the `_engine_type` function. This can be achieved by modifying the way the weak reference is created and handled in the `_engine` function.

## The Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the _engine function

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

This correction eliminates the unnecessary use of `weakref` and directly passes the PeriodIndex instance to the `_engine_type` function, ensuring that the weak reference is not prematurely dropped. This change is in line with the purpose of the `_engine` function and should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.

By making this modification, the `_engine` function should no longer experience the premature dropping of weak references, resulting in the correct functioning of related code, such as the failing test provided.
