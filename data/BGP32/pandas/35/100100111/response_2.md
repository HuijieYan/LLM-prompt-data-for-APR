## Analysis
1. The `@cache_readonly` decorator is used to cache the output of the `_engine` function.
2. The function creates a weak reference `period` of `self` and then passes it to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`.
3. The bug seems to stem from the weak reference being created and there might be an issue with how it is being used.

## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_engine` function arises from how the weak reference `period` of `self` is being passed to `_engine_type`. Weak references have a limitation where they may return `None` if the object they reference has been garbage collected. In this case, the weak reference may return `None` causing the `_engine_type` to receive `None` instead of the intended `self`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` retains a reference to `self` throughout the function's execution. One way to achieve this is by storing the weak reference `period` as an attribute of the function itself, ensuring that it doesn't get garbage collected prematurely.

## The Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# The corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference as an attribute of the function
    if not hasattr(self, '_period_ref'):
        self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    
    period = self._period_ref
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By modifying the `_engine` function to store the weak reference `period` as an attribute of the function, we ensure that it remains valid throughout the function's execution, thereby fixing the bug.
