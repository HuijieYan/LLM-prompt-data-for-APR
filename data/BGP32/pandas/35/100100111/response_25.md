### Analysis:
1. The buggy `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is then passed to `_engine_type`. This causes a reference cycle issue when accessing `self` in `_engine_type`, leading to a bug.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is checking if the levels of `idx2` are all monotonic, but due to weak reference handling issue, it fails.
3. The expected values and types for the variables are provided to ensure that the corrected function behaves as intended.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly maintained when passed to `_engine_type`.
5. The corrected version of the function should handle weak references correctly to prevent the reference cycle issue.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use a weak reference callback to maintain a proper weak reference
    period = weakref.ref(self, lambda _: None)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By adding a weak reference callback to the `weakref.ref` call, we ensure that the weak reference is appropriately handled without leading to a reference cycle issue. This corrected version should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
