## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a cached readonly property that returns an instance of `_engine_type` while passing a weak reference of `self` to it.
2. The bug seems to be related to the weak reference usage in the function `_engine`.
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is related to copying levels from `idx` MultiIndex to `idx2` MultiIndex and checking if they are monotonic.
4. The GitHub issue mentions that there is a problem with weak references being dropped prematurely, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving None instead of the intended PeriodIndex.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until it is used by `_engine_type`.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the weak reference `period` created in `_engine` is lost before `_engine_type` uses it due to Python's garbage collection behavior. This results in `_engine_type` receiving `None` instead of the intended `self`. 

## Fix Strategy
We need to ensure that the weak reference remains alive until `_engine_type` uses it. One way to achieve this is by storing the weak reference in a variable with a longer lifetime. This can be done by storing the weak reference within the `_engine` method itself.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference within the _engine method
    self_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self_weakref, len(self))
```

By storing `weakref` in `self_weakref`, you ensure that the reference to `self` remains alive until it is passed to `_engine_type`. This should fix the bug and ensure that the expected values are returned as per the failing test.
