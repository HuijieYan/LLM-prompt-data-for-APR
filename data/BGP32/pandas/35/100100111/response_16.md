## Analyzing the buggy function and failing test

The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` decorator used in Pandas for caching expensive computations. In this case, it tries to create an engine by passing a weak reference of `self` (a `PeriodIndex` object) to `_engine_type`, which is a potentially expensive operation. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` aims to check the monotonic property of levels in a `MultiIndex` created from a `PeriodIndex`.

## Identifying potential error locations

1. The weak reference creation `period = weakref.ref(self)` might not be capturing a strong reference to `self`.
2. The usage of the weak reference `period` when calling `_engine_type` could lead to `None` being passed if the weak reference is broken.

## Explaining the bug

In this scenario, the weak reference to `self` in the `_engine` function does not prevent it from being garbage collected, leading to the weak reference becoming `None`. Consequently, when `_engine_type` tries to use the weak reference to create an engine, it receives `None` instead of the actual `PeriodIndex` object, causing unexpected behavior and ultimately leading to the failing test case.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix this bug, a strong reference to `self` needs to be maintained within the `_engine` function to prevent it from being prematurely garbage collected. This involves storing `self` directly in a variable or using another suitable approach to ensure a strong reference to `self` is available when passing it to `_engine_type`.

## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a strong reference to self to avoid premature garbage collection
    self_ref = self
    return self._engine_type(self_ref, len(self))
```

By storing `self` in `self_ref`, we maintain a strong reference to the `PeriodIndex` object, preventing it from being garbage collected prematurely and resolving the issue identified in the failing test case.
