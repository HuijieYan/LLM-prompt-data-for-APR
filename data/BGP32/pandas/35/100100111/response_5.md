### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` and then pass it to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`. The issue seems to arise from the weak reference that might be getting lost or not correctly passed to `_engine_type`.

### Error Locations
1. Creation of weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)`.
2. Passing the weak reference `period` along with the length to `_engine_type`.

### Bug Explanation
The bug arises because the weak reference `period` created using `weakref.ref(self)` may not be properly handled or passed to `_engine_type`. This leads to the PeriodEngine receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`, causing the failing test.

### Fixing Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference remains valid and is correctly passed to `_engine_type`. One possible solution is to create a weak reference to `self` and then dereference it before passing it along with the length to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The revised and corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to avoid reference cycle
    period = weakref.ref(self)()

    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By dereferencing the weak reference immediately after creation using `weakref.ref(self)()`, we ensure that the correct `self` object is passed to the `_engine_type`. This correction should resolve the issue reported in GitHub and allow the failing test to pass.
