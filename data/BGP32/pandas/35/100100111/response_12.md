## Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_engine` function of the PeriodIndex class. The function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, but it is not handling the weak reference properly, resulting in the creation of a new Period object even after the original one has been garbage collected.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a MultiIndex with PeriodIndex levels and then tries to access the levels, which triggers the bug when checking monotonicity.

The issue reported on GitHub describes this bug, mentioning the weak reference loss leading to the PeriodEngine receiving `None` instead of the PeriodIndex.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is handled correctly in the `_engine` function. This can be achieved by dereferencing the weak reference to `self` before using it to create the engine.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

from pandas.util._decorators import Appender, cache_readonly, doc

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Dereference the weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By dereferencing the weak reference `period` by calling it as a function, we can ensure that the original `self` object is used to create the engine, fixing the weak reference loss issue. This corrected version should pass the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` and resolve the reported GitHub issue.
