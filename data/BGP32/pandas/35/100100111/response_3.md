## Analysis
The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to avoid a reference cycle but is not correctly passing the weak reference to `_engine_type`. This results in `_engine_type` receiving `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is checking if all levels in `idx2` are monotonic and expects it to be true. However, due to the bug in `_engine`, the weak reference is lost, leading to the failure of the test.

## Bug Cause
The bug in the `_engine` function causes the weak reference to `self` to be incorrectly passed to `_engine_type`, resulting in `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of a valid `PeriodIndex`. This leads to incorrect behavior when accessing attributes of `idx2` in the failing test, causing the test to fail.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly pass the weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`. This can be achieved by modifying the `_engine` function to activate the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`.

## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    period = period()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By activating the weak reference with `period()`, we ensure that the correct reference to `self` is passed to `_engine_type`. This modification resolves the bug and ensures that the weak reference is correctly maintained.
