## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` and then passing it to `_engine_type` along with the `len(self)` value. However, the issue mentioned on GitHub indicates that the weak reference to `self` is being dropped prematurely, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

## Error Location
The bug in this function lies in how the weak reference to `self` is handled. The weak reference should be maintained until the `_engine_type` function has finished using it.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because `weakref.ref(self)` creates a weak reference object but does not preserve it for the entire duration of `_engine` function execution. As a result, when `_engine_type` attempts to access the weak reference, it has already been collected, leading to `None` being passed instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the weak reference to `self` should be maintained as long as `_engine_type` requires it. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference in a local variable within the `_engine` function.

## The Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the _engine function

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference in a local variable to maintain it
    weak_self = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weak_self, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference in `weak_self` and passing this variable to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the weak reference is maintained until `_engine` completes the required operations. This correction should address the issue raised on GitHub and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
