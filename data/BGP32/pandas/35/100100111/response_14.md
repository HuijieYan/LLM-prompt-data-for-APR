### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` incorrectly. The purpose is to pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`, but it is not capturing the reference correctly. This leads to `period` being a weak reference to `self`, which causes issues when used in `_engine_type`.

### Bug Explanation
In the current buggy function, the weak reference `period` created using `weakref.ref(self)` is not captured properly, resulting in `period` being a weak reference object instead of a reference to `self`. This causes issues when `_engine_type` is called with `period`. As a result, the function does not work as expected, leading to test failures and an incorrect output.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, `period = weakref.ref(self)` needs to be replaced with `period = self`, capturing the actual reference to `self` instead of creating a weak reference object. This change will ensure that `_engine_type` receives the correct reference and operates as intended.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Capture the reference to self properly.
    period = self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By making this change, the corrected version of the `_engine` function should address the bug and pass the failing test, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the GitHub issue.
