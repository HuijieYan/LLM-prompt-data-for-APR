Based on the analysis provided, the issue seems to be related to the weak reference handling in the `_engine` function of the PeriodIndex. The weak reference `period` is being lost before it's intended to, causing the `_engine` to receive a `None` value instead of the intended PeriodIndex, leading to the AttributeError when trying to access an attribute.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the weak reference is maintained until it's properly utilized. One way to achieve this is by storing the weak reference within the `_engine` function itself, so it remains valid throughout the function execution.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weakref in a variable within the function
    self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference within the `_engine` function itself, we ensure that the reference remains valid until it's used in the `_engine_type` call, resolving the issue with losing the reference and encountering the AttributeError.
