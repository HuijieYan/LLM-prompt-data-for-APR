Based on the analysis of the buggy function, error message, runtime values, expected values, and the related GitHub issue, the bug in the `_engine` function is causing the unexpected `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error.

### Error Location:
The bug seems to be happening because the `weakref.ref` function is not properly handling the weak reference to the `self` object, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a `None` object instead of the expected PeriodIndex.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely occurring because the `weakref.ref` function is not creating a proper weak reference to `self`, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving a `None` object instead of the PeriodIndex.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly created and passed to the `_engine_type` function, ensuring that the PeriodEngine receives a valid PeriodIndex object.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use weakref.proxy to create a correctly handled weak reference to self
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we are creating a correctly handled weak reference to `self`, ensuring that the PeriodEngine receives the expected PeriodIndex object. This should fix the bug and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
