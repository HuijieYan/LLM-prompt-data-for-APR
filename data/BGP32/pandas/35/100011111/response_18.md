Based on the provided information, the bug in the `_engine` function is causing an `AttributeError` due to a `NoneType` object trying to access an attribute `view`. The issue results from the weak reference to `self` being lost before being passed to `_engine_type`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` persists until after it is used in `_engine_type`. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

This fix maintains the reference to `self` while calling the `_engine_type` function. By passing `period()` instead of `period`, we ensure that the weak reference is converted to the actual object before usage. This correction should resolve the `AttributeError` and allow the test case to pass successfully.
