### Analyzing the buggy function and error message
The buggy function `_engine` uses a weak reference to prevent a reference cycle and then utilizes it in `self._engine_type` to create an engine instance. The error message suggests an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, indicating that the engine instance is not created correctly, leading to a `NoneType` object being accessed.

### Potential error locations
1. The weak reference implementation might be incorrect leading to the issue.
2. The usage of the weak reference in `self._engine_type` might not be handling weak references properly.

### Explanation of the bug
The weak reference `period` is created but may not be used correctly within the `_engine_type` method, resulting in a NoneType object being accessed when trying to access the engine's view.

### Fix strategy
Ensure that the weak reference is properly utilized within the `_engine_type` method and that the engine instance is created seamlessly to avoid NoneType access.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type
    if engine_type is None:
        raise ValueError("Engine type is None.")
    return engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

In the corrected version, I check if the `self._engine_type` is not None before creating the engine instance to prevent any NoneType access.
