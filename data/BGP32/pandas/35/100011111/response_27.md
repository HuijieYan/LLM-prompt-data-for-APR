Based on the analysis of the buggy function, error message, input/output values, expected values, and the related GitHub issue, the bug is caused by the weak reference not being properly maintained, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` object instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, the weak reference should be correctly implemented and maintained throughout the function execution.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# Updated and corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

The correction involves calling `period()` to retrieve the original object from the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`.

By implementing this correction, the function will maintain the weak reference properly, ensuring that the `PeriodEngine` receives the actual `PeriodIndex` object instead of `None`, resolving the issue with the failing tests and aligning with the expected input/output values mentioned.
