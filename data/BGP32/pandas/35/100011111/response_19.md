### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self` (a `PeriodIndex` object) before passing it to `self._engine_type`. However, the issue arises because the weak reference is stored as `period`, but it should be accessed and dereferenced properly before being passed to `_engine_type` to avoid getting `NoneType`.

### Error Cause:
The error occurs because when trying to access the weak reference inside the `_engine` function, it is not dereferenced correctly, leading to the weak reference being used inappropriately and resulting in `NoneType`, causing the subsequent AttributeError.

### Fix Strategy:
The weak reference needs to be dereferenced correctly before passing it to `_engine_type`. This can be done using `period()` to obtain the referenced object from the weak reference.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `period()` is called to dereference the weak reference and obtain the `PeriodIndex` object before passing it to `_engine_type`. This modification ensures that the correct object is passed to `_engine_type` and resolves the issue causing the AttributeError.
