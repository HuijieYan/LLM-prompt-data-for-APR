### Analysis
The issue stems from the fact that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped prematurely, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `NoneType` instead of the expected reference. This results in the `NoneType` object having no attribute `view`, leading to an `AttributeError`.

### Bug Explanation
The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is a `PeriodIndex`. However, when the current weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is passed to `_engine_type`, it is already dropped before intended due to the usage of `period = weakref.ref(self)`. As a result, the `self` reference received by `_engine_type` is `None`, leading to the subsequent `AttributeError` when attempting to access the `view` attribute.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until it is passed to `_engine_type`. This can be achieved by modifying how the weak reference is stored and accessed. 

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Maintain the weak reference until it's used
    weak_period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weak_period_ref, len(self))
```

By storing `weakref.ref(self)` in `weak_period_ref` and then passing `weak_period_ref` instead of directly using `weakref.ref(self)`, we can ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is not prematurely dropped, resolving the issue.
