### Analysis:
The `PeriodIndex` is losing its weak reference before being passed to the `PeriodEngine`, leading to an error where it receives a `None` object instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`. This causes the `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.

### Bug Cause:
The `_engine` function creates a weak reference to `self`, but it is not properly handling the reference lifecycle, leading to premature deletion of the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until it is passed to `_engine_type`. We can achieve this by storing it in a variable in the `_engine` function itself.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a weak reference to self in a variable to maintain the reference
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
``` 

By storing the weak reference in the `period_ref` variable, we ensure that it is not prematurely deleted before being used in `_engine_type`. This correction should resolve the issue and allow the test to pass as expected.
