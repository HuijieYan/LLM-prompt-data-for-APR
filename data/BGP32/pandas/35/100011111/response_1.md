### Analysis
The error message indicates an AttributeError due to a 'NoneType' object having no attribute 'view', leading to the failing test. The buggy function `_engine` returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, where `period` is created as a weak reference to `self`. The issue is related to weaker referencing and dropping the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` prematurely, causing `self._engine` to receive `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

### Bug Cause
In the provided code, `period = weakref.ref(self)` creates a weak reference to `self`, but the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` (`period`) is lost before being utilized, resulting in a 'NoneType' object error.

### Fix Strategy
To address this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference remains available during the `_engine` function call to prevent the 'NoneType' issue. We should maintain the weak reference until it is utilized inside the `_engine_type` function.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)  # Create a weak reference
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))  # Utilize the weak reference by calling period() to retrieve original object
```

By updating the `_engine` function as shown above, we maintain the weak reference until it is actually used. This fix ensures that the 'NoneType' error due to the premature dropping of the weakly referenced object is resolved, allowing the function to work correctly as intended.
