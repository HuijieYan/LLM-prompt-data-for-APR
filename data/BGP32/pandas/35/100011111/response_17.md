### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a property decorated with `cache_readonly`. It takes `self` as an input, creates a weak reference to `self`, and then calls `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.
2. The error occurs when trying to access an attribute on a `NoneType` object, specifically when trying to access `view("i8")`.
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` involves creating a `MultiIndex` from `PeriodIndex` levels and checking if the levels are monotonic using `is_monotonic`. This operation reaches the `_engine` property, causing the error due to improper handling of weak references.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` does not get disconnected prematurely, allowing the `_engine_type` method to receive a valid reference to `self`.

### Fixing the Bug:
To address the issue of weak references getting lost prematurely, we can modify the `_engine` function as follows:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    weakself = weakref.ref(self)
    
    def get_engine():
        return weakself()._engine_type(weakself, len(weakself()))
    
    return get_engine
```
In the corrected version:
- We create a `weakself` weak reference to `self` outside the inner function `get_engine` to ensure the reference persists.
- We define an inner function `get_engine` to access the weak reference and call `_engine_type` with the weak reference and length of `self`.
- Finally, we return the inner function `get_engine` to access the engine when needed.

This adjustment should maintain the weak reference until it is safely accessed within `_engine_type`, addressing the premature disconnection issue observed in the failing test.
