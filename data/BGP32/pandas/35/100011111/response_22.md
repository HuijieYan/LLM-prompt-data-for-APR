To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, we need to ensure that the reference to `self` is maintained correctly to avoid it being dropped prematurely. The error message indicates that there is an issue with `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` object instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

One possible strategy to fix this bug is to ensure the weak reference to `self` is stored in a way that prevents it from being garbage-collected before it's needed. We can achieve this by storing the weak reference in a class attribute or another suitable location that maintains the reference.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference to self in a class attribute _period_weakref
    if not hasattr(self, '_period_weakref'):
        self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference to `self` in the `_period_weakref` class attribute, we ensure that the reference is maintained throughout the function's execution, preventing it from being garbage-collected.

This correction should address the issue raised in the failing test related to weakrefs being dropped prematurely, ensuring that `PeriodEngine` receives the necessary `PeriodIndex` object.
