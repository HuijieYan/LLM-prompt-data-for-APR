The bug in the `_engine` function is likely arising from the weak reference to `self` not being properly maintained in the PeriodEngine object, resulting in a `NoneType` error when trying to access the view attribute. The weakref.ref method is not holding a strong reference to the PeriodIndex object, leading to its premature deletion and causing issues when accessing its attributes.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` maintains a reference to the PeriodIndex object. We can do this by storing the weak reference to `self` within the `_engine` function and then using it when instantiating the PeriodEngine class. This way, we ensure that the reference is kept alive until it is no longer needed.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a weak reference to self within the function
    self._weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    
    # Use the stored weak reference to instantiate the PeriodEngine
    return self._engine_type(self._weakref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference within the function, we ensure that the PeriodIndex object is not prematurely deleted, fixing the issue with the NoneType error.

This correction should resolve the problem described in the GitHub issue and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
