### Analyzing the buggy function and error message
The buggy function `_engine` in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file is generating an error related to the `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`. The error is linked to the function `is_monotonic` and `is_monotonic_increasing` when trying to access the `_engine` attribute.

The failing test is related to handling `PeriodIndex` objects within a `MultiIndex`. The test fails due to the `_engine` attribute returning a `NoneType` instead of the expected `PeriodEngine` object.

### Identifying potential error locations
The potential error location is the weak reference creation and usage within the `_engine` function. The weak reference `period` is being created but not properly maintained, leading to the `NoneType` error when trying to access the `_engine` attribute.

### Explaining the cause of the bug
The bug arises from the weak reference `period` being created incorrectly in the `_engine` function, which results in the loss of reference to the `PeriodIndex` object causing the `NoneType` error. This error prevents the proper functioning of operations that rely on the `_engine` attribute, leading to test failures.

### Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the weak reference creation and handling should be revised to maintain a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex` object within the `_engine` function. This would involve ensuring that the weak reference remains valid throughout the function's execution to avoid the `NoneType` error and enable proper functioning of operations that rely on the `_engine` attribute.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
# The corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Obtain the referenced object from the weak reference
    referenced_period = period()
    return self._engine_type(referenced_period, len(self))
```

By maintaining a reference to the `PeriodIndex` object through the weak reference `period` and retrieving it correctly before passing it to `_engine_type`, the corrected version of the function should address the `NoneType` error and enable the proper functioning of operations relying on the `_engine` attribute.
