### Analysis
The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `PeriodEngine` being passed a `NoneType` object instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`. This is likely due to the weak reference not being properly handled in the `_engine` function. The failing test expects the function to return a `PeriodArray` but it results in a `NoneType`, causing the error.

### Bug Cause
The `weakref.ref(self)` used in `_engine` function is not properly handling the weak reference, resulting in a `NoneType` object being passed to `_engine_type`. This causes the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

### Fix Strategy
We need to ensure the weak reference is correctly maintained so that the `PeriodIndex` object is properly passed to `_engine_type`. To fix this, we can modify the `_engine` function to properly handle the weak reference and avoid the `NoneType` issue.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By invoking `period()` to get the actual object being weakly referenced, we ensure that the `PeriodIndex` object is passed to `_engine_type` instead of a `NoneType`. This correction should resolve the issue and allow the function to return the expected `PeriodArray`.
