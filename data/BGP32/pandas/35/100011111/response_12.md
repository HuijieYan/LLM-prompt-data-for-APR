### Analysis:
1. The `_engine` function creates a weak reference to `self` and then calls `_engine_type` with this weak reference. The issue arises because the weak reference is lost before reaching the `_engine_type`, resulting in a `NoneType` error.
2. The error message indicates that the `self._engine` attribute is returning `None`, causing subsequent attribute access to fail with an `AttributeError`.
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` instantiates a MultiIndex with a PeriodIndex, accesses the levels, and checks if they are monotonic, leading to the AttributeError due to the weak reference issue.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is maintained until it is used by the `_engine_type` constructor.
5. Update the `_engine` function to correct the weak reference handling.

### Bug Fix:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Maintain the weak reference until the _engine_type is called
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```

By updating the `_engine` function to maintain the weak reference until the constructor is called, we resolve the issue of losing the weak reference prematurely. This fix ensures that the `_engine_type` constructor receives a valid reference to `self`.
