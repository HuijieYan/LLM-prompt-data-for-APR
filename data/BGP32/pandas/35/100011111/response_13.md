### Bug Analysis:
The bug is occurring because the `_engine` method is attempting to create a weak reference to `self` but then passing the weak reference object instead of the actual `self` to `_engine_type`, causing it to receive `None`.

The cause of the error message `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` is that the `PeriodEngine` is expecting a valid reference to `self` but is receiving `None` instead due to the incorrect handling of the weak reference.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is correctly handled and that the actual `self` object is passed to `_engine_type` instead of the weak reference object.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use weakref.proxy to create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we create a weak reference object that behaves like a normal reference to `self`, allowing it to be correctly passed to `_engine_type`. This correction should resolve the bug and pass the failing test.
