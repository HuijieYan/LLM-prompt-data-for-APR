### Bug Analysis:
The `_engine` function is meant to return the `PeriodEngine` instance associated with the `PeriodIndex`. The issue is that a weak reference of `self` is being passed to `_engine_type`, which could be causing the `PeriodEngine` instance to receive a `None` instead of the actual `PeriodIndex`.

### Bug Location:
The issue is likely within the weak reference creation and utilization in the `_engine` function.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. The weak reference `period` is defined as `weakref.ref(self)`, which creates a weak reference to `self`.
2. The weak reference `period` is then being passed to `self._engine_type` along with the length of `self`.
3. If the weak reference is not handled correctly by `_engine_type`, it might be interpreting the weak reference as `None` instead of the actual `self`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
Instead of using a weak reference, directly pass `self` to `_engine_type`. This will ensure that the actual `PeriodIndex` instance is passed correctly to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
``` 

By directly passing `self` to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the actual `PeriodIndex` instance is used to create the `PeriodEngine`, avoiding any weak reference issues.
