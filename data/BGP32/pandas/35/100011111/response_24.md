### Analyzing the buggy function and error message
The buggy function `_engine` is a cached read-only property that should return the `_engine_type` of the PeriodIndex. This property creates a weak reference to the PeriodIndex instance to avoid reference cycles. The error message indicates an AttributeError caused by a 'NoneType' object having no attribute 'view'. This error occurs when trying to access the view method on a `NoneType`.

### Identified potential error locations
The issue seems to arise from the creation of the weak reference `period` in the `_engine` function and how it is passed to the `_engine_type`. 

### Explanation of the bug
The bug occurs because the weak reference `period` that is being passed to `_engine_type` is not properly referencing the PeriodIndex instance, resulting in a 'NoneType' error when trying to use the object later. This leads to unexpected behavior and errors during runtime.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
To fix this bug, it's necessary to ensure that the weak reference `period` properly references the PeriodIndex instance before being passed to `_engine_type`. This can be achieved by implementing a robust weak reference mechanism.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
# Fix for the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    def weak_ref_callback(ref):
        pass  # Placeholder to hold reference
        
    period = weakref.ref(self, weak_ref_callback)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we are providing a callback function `weak_ref_callback` to the `weakref.ref` method to ensure that the weak reference is maintained correctly. This should prevent the 'NoneType' error and resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report.
