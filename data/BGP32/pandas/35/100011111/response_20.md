## Analysis
1. The function `_engine` is decorated with `@cache_readonly`, indicating that it should cache the return value.
2. The bug seems to be that the weak reference `period` is not being properly passed to `_engine_type`, resulting in a `NoneType` error.
3. The error message indicates that accessing `view` on a `NoneType` object is causing the issue.
4. To fix the bug, ensure that the weak reference `period` is correctly passed to `_engine_type`.

## Bug Fix
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# Fix the _engine function to correctly pass the weak reference
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By modifying the return statement to pass the referred object from the weak reference using `period()`, we can ensure that the correct object is passed to `_engine_type`, fixing the bug. This change should resolve the `NoneType` error and allow the function to return the expected output.
