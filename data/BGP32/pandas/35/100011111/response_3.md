## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is intended to return an instance of `PeriodEngine` using a weak reference of `self`. The issue arises when `self` is passed as a weak reference `period`, but `self` is a `PeriodIndex`, not an instance of `PeriodEngine`. As a result, when attempting to access attributes of `self` within `PeriodEngine`, a `NoneType` error occurs.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the weak reference `period` is not being used correctly. The `PeriodEngine` expects an instance of `PeriodIndex`, but due to the weak reference, it is receiving a `NoneType` object.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the original `self` instance is correctly passed to `PeriodEngine`. One way to achieve this is by creating a new instance of `PeriodEngine` with the original `self` object rather than the weak reference.

## Code Fix
Below is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By passing `self` directly to the `PeriodEngine` constructor, we eliminate the issue with the weak reference. This change ensures that the correct `self` instance is used within `PeriodEngine`, resolving the `NoneType` error.
