### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `_engine(self)` function when it creates a weak reference to `self` but does not properly utilize it. This leads to an issue where the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before it should, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `NoneType` object instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the `_engine(self)` function, specifically in how the weak reference (`period`) is being used.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is that the weak reference (`period`) is not utilized correctly when passed to `_engine_type`, resulting in premature dropping of the `PeriodIndex`. This leads to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `NoneType` object, causing the attribute error.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is correctly maintained until after it is used by `_engine_type` to avoid premature dropping of the `PeriodIndex`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By modifying the return statement to use `period()` instead of `period`, we ensure that the weak reference is properly resolved before being passed to `_engine_type`. This correction will prevent the `NoneType` object error and resolve the failing test.
