### Analysis
The error message indicates an `AttributeError` in `return super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter().view("i8")` due to a `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`. This suggests that the `self._engine` attribute is not properly set, resulting in a `NoneType`.

Looking at the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, we see that `self` is a `PeriodIndex` object containing values `'2019Q1'` and `'2019Q2'`. The function likely attempts to set `_engine_type` with a `weakref.ref(self)` call but may be incorrectly returning None instead of the expected `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug stems from the incorrect handling of weak references in the `_engine` function. Weak references are meant to prevent reference cycles that could lead to memory leaks, but in this case, the weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` is not properly being used to create the `_engine_type` object.

The bug causes the `_engine` attribute to be set as None instead of an instance of `PeriodEngine` which leads to the AttributeError when accessing the `view` attribute later in the process.

### Fixing the Bug
To address the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is appropriately utilized and that it correctly creates an instance of `PeriodEngine` using the `weakref.ref(self)` object. This will prevent the NoneType error occurring during attribute access.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By correcting the function to call `period()` to retrieve the original object from the weak reference and passing it to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the `_engine` attribute is set correctly, resolving the issue and preventing the AttributeError.
