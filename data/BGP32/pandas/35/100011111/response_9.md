### Analyzing the buggy function and error message
The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute on a `NoneType` object within the `_do_monotonic_check` function. This error occurs when trying to check if the index is monotonic increasing.

The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to get a weak reference to `self`, but it seems that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped prematurely, leading to the `NoneType` object error.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the premature dropping of the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object, resulting in the `_engine` attribute being resolved to `None` instead of the expected `PeriodEngine` object.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object remains valid when passed to `_engine_type`. This can be achieved by keeping a strong reference to the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object until after the `_engine_type` function is called.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Keep a strong reference to the weakly referenced self until _engine_type is called
    strong_ref = self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By keeping a strong reference to `self` in the `_engine` function before creating the weak reference, we ensure that the weak reference remains valid until after the `_engine_type` function is called.

This corrected version should resolve the premature dropping of the weak reference and the resulting `NoneType` error, allowing the test case to pass successfully.
