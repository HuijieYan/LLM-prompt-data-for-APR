### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` decorator function that returns an instance of `_engine_type` by passing a weak reference of `self` to it.
2. The error message points to an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, suggesting that the weak reference is not working as intended.
3. The test failure occurs when trying to access the `is_monotonic_increasing` property using the `_engine` attribute, which is returning `None` instead of the expected `_engine_type` instance.
4. The bug seems to stem from how the weak reference is being used, causing the `_engine` attribute to return `None`.

### Bug Cause:
The weak reference stored in the `period` variable is not being properly maintained, leading to the garbage collection of the referenced object (`self`) before it is intended to be used.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` stays alive until it is used to create the `_engine_type` instance. One way to achieve this is by storing the weak reference in a class attribute (e.g., `self._period_weakref`) instead of a local variable within the function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference in a class attribute to prevent premature garbage collection
    self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference in `self._period_weakref`, we ensure that the reference to `self` remains alive until it is used to create the `_engine_type` instance, fixing the bug that caused the `NoneType` error.
