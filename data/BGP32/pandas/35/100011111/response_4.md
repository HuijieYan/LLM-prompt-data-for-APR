### Analysis
The provided buggy function `_engine` seems to be creating a weak reference to the `self` object (presumed to be a `PeriodIndex` instance) and then using it to initialize the `_engine_type` attribute. However, due to the weak reference usage, there is a problem with the reference to the `self` object during the `_engine_type` initialization, which leads to an `AttributeError` later during execution.

The error message indicates that a `NoneType` object is being accessed for the 'view' attribute, which means the weak reference is not holding the reference properly.

### Cause of the Bug
The usage of `weakref.ref()` in the `_engine` function creates a weak reference to the `self` object. When `self` is passed to `_engine_type`, it seems that the weak reference is dropped prematurely, leading to `None` being passed instead of the actual `self` object. This causes the `AttributeError` during execution.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is kept alive until it's no longer needed. One way to achieve this is by storing the weak reference within the `self` object itself. By doing so, we can maintain a reference to the weak reference object and prevent it from being garbage collected prematurely.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    if not hasattr(self, "_period_weakref"):
        self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

In this corrected version, we store the weak reference inside the `self` object as `_period_weakref` attribute. This ensures that the weak reference remains alive as long as the `self` object exists. As a result, the `AttributeError` should no longer occur, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
