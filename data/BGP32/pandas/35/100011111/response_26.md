### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the weak reference to the `self` object, which is a `PeriodIndex`, is not properly passed to the `_engine_type` function. Consequently, when trying to access the `_engine` attribute of the `self` object within the `is_monotonic_increasing` function, it results in an `AttributeError` because the value is actually `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly pass a weak reference of the `self` object to the `_engine_type` function to ensure that the `PeriodEngine` object receives the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex`. This will prevent the issue of `NoneType` object being accessed later on.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Properly pass a weak reference of self to _engine_type
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By updating the function to pass `period()` instead of just `period` to `_engine_type`, we can ensure that the weak reference is correctly dereferenced and used to construct the `PeriodEngine` object. This should resolve the issue and prevent the `AttributeError` from occurring.
