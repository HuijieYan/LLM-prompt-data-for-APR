### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is supposed to create a weak reference to the `self` object (a `PeriodIndex`) and then pass it to `_engine_type` along with the length of the `PeriodIndex`. The issue seems to be related to incorrect handling of weak references, resulting in a `NoneType` object being accessed later in the execution.

The error message indicates an `AttributeError` with a `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`. This suggests that the weak reference is not working as expected, and the `PeriodEngine` is trying to access an attribute on a `NoneType` object.

Based on the GitHub issue, the problem seems to be related to losing weakrefs when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`.

### Strategy
1. Ensure that the weak reference creation is correctly preserving the reference to the `self` object.
2. Update the `_engine` function to handle the weak reference properly to prevent losing the reference.

### Updated Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `period()` is called to return the weakly referenced object explicitly when passing it to `_engine_type`. This change ensures that the weak reference is correctly handled, preventing the `NoneType` object access issue.
