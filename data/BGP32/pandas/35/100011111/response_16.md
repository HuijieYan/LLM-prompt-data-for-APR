### Analysis
The `_engine` function is assigned to return `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. The issue arises from the `weakref.ref(self)` method, which creates a weak reference to `self`, intending to avoid a reference cycle. However, the weak reference doesn't serve its purpose as expected, resulting in an AttributeError when trying to access the `.view("i8")` attribute later in the code.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the weak reference created for `self` is not maintained or used properly, leading to a `NoneType` object instead of the expected `PeriodIndex` object.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the weak reference to `self` needs to be handled correctly in a way that preserves the reference throughout the `_engine` function's execution. By ensuring that the weak reference survives until needed, the AttributeError can be prevented.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    ref = weakref.ref(self)
    
    class EngineRef:
        def __init__(self, ref):
            self.ref = ref
        
        def __getattr__(self, item):
            if self.ref() is None:
                raise AttributeError("Weakly referenced object is no longer available.")
            return getattr(self.ref(), item)
    
    return EngineRef(ref)
```

This revised version creates a nested class `EngineRef` that ensures the weak reference remains accessible when needed. This way, accessing attributes via `EngineRef` prevents the weak reference from being lost prematurely.
