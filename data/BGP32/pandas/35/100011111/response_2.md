### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` decorator function that returns a result based on weak referencing of `self`. The error message indicates an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, suggesting that there is an issue with the weak reference being None at a certain point.

The failing test involves checking if certain levels in a `MultiIndex` are monotonic. The issue is related to weak referencing not being handled correctly, causing a `NoneType` to be passed where an object is expected, leading to the attribute error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is handled properly in the `_engine` function to prevent it being None. One solution could involve storing the weak reference outside the cache and reacquiring it when needed to ensure its validity. Another approach could be to modify the caching mechanism to properly account for the weak reference.

### Updated Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    if hasattr(self, "_period_ref") and self._period_ref():
        period = self._period_ref()
    else:
        self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
        period = self._period_ref()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected version above, we check if the weak reference `_period_ref` exists and is not None. If it is available, we retrieve the `period` from it; otherwise, we assign the weak reference to `_period_ref` and then obtain the `period`. This approach ensures that the weak reference is correctly handled and utilized in the `_engine` function to avoid the `NoneType` error.
