The issue with the buggy function `_engine` is that it is returning `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`, leading to the AttributeError when trying to access attributes on a `NoneType`. To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is retained during the function's execution.

Here's a corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
from pandas._libs.index import PeriodEngine

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return PeriodEngine(period(), len(self))
```

In this corrected version, we first create a weak reference to `self` and then pass the result of dereferencing `period()` to `PeriodEngine` as intended.

By making this change, the function will correctly return the `PeriodEngine` instance with the valid `PeriodIndex`, resolving the AttributeError and allowing the test case to pass successfully as expected.
