### Analysis
The error message indicates an `AttributeError` on a `NoneType` object when trying to access the `view` attribute. The issue described in the GitHub problem is related to weak references being dropped unintentionally.

### Potential Error Location
The issue seems to be related to how weak references are handled in the `_engine` function.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the weak reference `period` is not being used correctly in the `_engine` function. When creating a weak reference using `weakref.ref(self)`, it returns an object that needs to be dereferenced to get the original object. In this case, `period` should be dereferenced using `period()` before passing it to `_engine_type`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Dereference the weak reference `period` by calling `period()`.
2. Update the return statement to use the dereferenced `period`.

### Corrected Version
```python
# Corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By correctly dereferencing the weak reference `period` before passing it to `_engine_type`, the corrected version of the function should resolve the issue and pass the failing test case.
