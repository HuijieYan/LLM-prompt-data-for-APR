### Analyzing the buggy function and error message

The buggy function `_engine` is a cached read-only property that creates a weak reference to `self` (which is a `PeriodIndex` object) and then calls `self._engine_type()` with the weak reference as the first argument. The function is used in the context of retrieving the engine for the index, but the error message suggests that `self._engine_type()` returns `None`, resulting in 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view' error later in the process.

The failing test is related to ensuring that indexing levels are monotonic, and it involves constructing a MultiIndex from PeriodIndex levels and checking if they are monotonic.

### Error location

The issue seems to be coming from `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))` line in the `_engine` function. The `_engine_type` method seems to be returning `None`, leading to the AttributeError when further methods are called assuming it is a valid object.

### Cause of the bug

The bug seems to be related to `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` returning `None` instead of an actual engine object, leading to the AttributeError later on in the process.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` returns a valid engine object instead of `None`.

### Corrected version of the function

Here is the corrected version:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        return self._default_engine()
    return engine
```

In this correction, we first call `_engine_type()` and then check if the returned engine is `None`. If it is `None`, we call a `_default_engine()` method (not provided in the provided code, but should be implemented separately) to return a default engine. This approach ensures that the function returns a valid engine object.
