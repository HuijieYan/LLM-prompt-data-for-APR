### Analyzing the buggy function and error message

- The buggy function is `_engine(self)` which is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` object.
- The buggy code is aiming to avoid a reference cycle by passing a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`.
- The error occurs when `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))` is executed during the failing test.
- The error message specifies `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.
- The failing test expects the function to correctly handle the weak reference to `self` and return the appropriate engine type without encountering the error.

### Identifying potential error locations
- The error might be related to the weak reference `period` causing an issue when passed to `_engine_type`.
- The weak reference may lose reference to `self`, resulting in `NoneType` error during further operations.

### Explaining the cause of the bug
- The weak reference created to avoid reference cycles might not be holding the reference to `self` properly throughout the execution.
- Due to this, when `_engine_type` is called with the weak reference, it results in a `NoneType` object error during attribute access.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
- To fix the bug, a strong reference should be maintained for `self` throughout the process to ensure that `_engine_type` receives the actual object, not a `NoneType`.
- This can be achieved by storing a strong reference alongside the weak reference and using the strong reference when dealing with `_engine_type`.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    strong_self = self  # Strong reference to self
    return self._engine_type(strong_self, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, a `strong_self` reference is added alongside the weak reference `period` to maintain a strong reference to `self`, ensuring that `_engine_type` receives the actual object without encountering the `NoneType` error.
