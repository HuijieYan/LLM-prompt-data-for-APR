### Analysis:
1. The `_engine` function is a cache readonly function that returns an instance of `self._engine_type` by passing a weak reference of `self` to it.
2. The error message indicates that an `AttributeError` occurs because the `_engine` function returns `NoneType` instead of the expected `PeriodEngine`.
3. The expected values for the input parameters are provided.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the problem with weak references getting dropped prematurely, leading to the error.

### Bug:
The bug occurs because the weak reference `period` is not being used correctly, leading to a `None` return rather than a valid `PeriodEngine`.

### Fix Strategy:
- Ensure that the weak reference `period` is maintained during the creation of the `PeriodEngine`.
- Pass the weak reference correctly to `_engine_type`.

### Correction:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

By changing `period` to `period()` in the `return` statement, we dereference the weak reference to get the actual object instance before passing it to `_engine_type`. This change ensures that the correct `PeriodEngine` instance is returned.
