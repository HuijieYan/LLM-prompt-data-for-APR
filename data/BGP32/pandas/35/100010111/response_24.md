Based on the given error message, the `_engine` function seems to be returning `None` instead of the expected `PeriodEngine`, causing an `AttributeError` when trying to access an attribute of `None`. This behavior is leading to failure of the test case `test_get_level_values_when_periods`.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `_engine` function returns the expected `PeriodEngine` instance.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine
```

By explicitly returning the `engine` instance from `_engine` function, we ensure that the expected `PeriodEngine` object is returned instead of `None`.

This correction should resolve the issue reported on GitHub regarding the bug related to losing weak references in MultiIndex levels.
