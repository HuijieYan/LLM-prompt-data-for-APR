## Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The function is supposed to create an instance of the `_engine` type using a weak reference to the `self` object. However, the weak reference is incorrectly assigned and does not work as intended. This leads to an `AttributeError` when accessing the `view` attribute of the `NoneType`.

## Error Cause
The cause of the bug is incorrect usage of weakref in assigning `period = weakref.ref(self)`. This results in `period` being a weak reference object itself rather than the expected reference to `self`. When the `_engine_type` method is called with `period` as the first argument, it receives a weak reference object instead of the `self` object, leading to `NoneType` error when it tries to access attributes.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly obtain a weak reference to the `self` object by using `period = weakref.ref(self)()`. This way, `period` will hold a reference to the `self` object, and when passed to `_engine_type`, it will be a valid reference. This should resolve the `AttributeError` that occurs due to the incorrect weak referencing.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# Corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Obtain a weak reference to the self object correctly
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By making this modification, the `PeriodEngine` will receive a valid reference to the `self` object, fixing the bug and resolving the `AttributeError` issue.
