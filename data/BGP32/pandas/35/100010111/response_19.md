### Analysis
The error occurs when trying to access the attribute `view` on a `NoneType` object, suggesting that the `_engine` attribute of the `PeriodEngine` is returning `None` instead of the expected value. This leads to the AttributeError when attempting to access `view("i8")`.

The `_engine` function should return the appropriate `PeriodEngine` instance with the expected parameters, but due to the usage of `weakref.ref`, the reference to `self` might be handled incorrectly.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the weak reference not being used properly in the `_engine` function. Creating a weak reference to `self` using `weakref.ref(self)` does not retain a strong reference, which results in the `_engine` attribute returning `None` instead of the expected `PeriodEngine` instance.

### Suggested Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is utilized correctly so that it does not get garbage collected prematurely. One potential solution is to create a strong reference by converting the weak reference back to an object before passing it to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a strong reference using a weak reference object
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By invoking the weak reference object `period = weakref.ref(self)()`, we convert it back to a strong reference before passing it to `_engine_type`. This way, the expected `PeriodEngine` instance is returned without any `NoneType` issues.
