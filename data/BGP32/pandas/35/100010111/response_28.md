### Analysis:
1. The `PeriodEngine` is expecting a weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` but due to a bug in the `_engine` function, it is passing a `NoneType` object which causes the `AttributeError`.
2. The `period` variable is being set as a weak reference to `self`, the `PeriodIndex` object, but this reference is not being correctly passed to `_engine_type`, leading to the issue.
3. The bug causes an incorrect weak reference object to be passed to `_engine_type`, resulting in a `NoneType` object being passed instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`. This leads to the `AttributeError` when trying to access the view of the weak reference in `PeriodEngine`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference object is used correctly and the `PeriodIndex` object is correctly passed to `_engine_type`.

### Bug Fix:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` instead of `period`, we ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object is correctly passed to `_engine_type` in the corrected version of the function. This change should resolve the issue and pass the failing test case.
