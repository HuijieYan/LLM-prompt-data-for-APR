### Analysis:
1. The `_engine` function seems to aim at creating an instance of the `_engine_type` using a weak reference of `self`. However, the weak reference creation is incorrect in the current implementation.
2. The error message indicates that an AttributeError is raised due to a `NoneType` object being accessed for `view` attribute.
3. The expected input values include a `self._values` which is a `PeriodArray` and `self` which is a `PeriodIndex`. The error occurs when the engine attempts to access the values of a weakly referenced PeriodIndex.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correctly create a weak reference of `self` in the `_engine` function.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the weak reference creation in the `_engine` function to correctly reference `self`.
2. Ensure the weak reference maintains a reference to the PeriodIndex instance until the engine finishes using it.
3. This will allow the engine to access the values it needs without encountering a `NoneType` object issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Correctly create a weak reference of self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    self._weak_period = period  # Assign to an instance variable to maintain the reference
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By updating the weak reference creation in this manner, we ensure that the `_engine` function can access the values it needs from the `PeriodIndex` instance without encountering any AttributeError related to `NoneType`.
