### Analysis
The `PeriodEngine` class attempts to use a weak reference of self to avoid reference cycles, but the weak reference is not being maintained properly. This results in the `period` variable being equal to `None`, causing the error when attempting to access its attributes.

### Error Cause
The error occurs because the weak reference `period` in the `_engine` function is not correctly holding a reference to `self`. This results in `period` being `None`, causing the AttributeError when trying to access the `view()` method.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the weak reference `period` should be correctly implemented to hold a reference to the object `self` to prevent reference cycles. We can use `weakref.proxy` to create a weak reference proxy object to `self`.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

def _engine(self):
    # Avoid reference cycles by creating a weak reference proxy to self
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we ensure that a weak reference proxy object to `self` is created, maintaining the reference without causing reference cycles. This corrected version should resolve the error and pass the failing test.
