### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference of `self`, which is a `PeriodIndex` object. The bug occurs because `_engine_type` is expecting a `PeriodEngine` object but receives a `weakref` object instead. This issue is related to losing the reference to the weakly referenced object.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by passing the weak reference object `period` to `_engine_type` instead of the actual `PeriodIndex` object. This results in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `NoneType` object instead of the expected `PeriodIndex` object, leading to an `AttributeError` when trying to access attributes on that `NoneType` object.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to pass the actual `PeriodIndex` object to `_engine_type` instead of the weak reference object. This can be achieved by calling `period()` to extract the original object from the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

By modifying the `_engine` function to call `period()` before passing it to `_engine_type, we ensure that the actual `PeriodIndex` object is passed to the `PeriodEngine`, resolving the bug. This correction should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and pass the failing test.
