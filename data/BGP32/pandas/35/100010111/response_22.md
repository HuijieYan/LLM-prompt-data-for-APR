### Analysis
- The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` (which is a `PeriodIndex` object) to avoid reference cycles.
- The function then calls `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, where `period` is a weak reference object.
- The error message suggests an `AttributeError` related to `NoneType` object not having the attribute `view`.
- The failing test involves checking whether the levels of a `MultiIndex` are monotonic, which is done by accessing `self._engine.is_monotonic_increasing`.

### Error Cause
The error occurs because the weak reference `period` is not properly handled or used in a way that leads to a `NoneType` object being passed to `_engine_type`, causing the AttributeError when trying to access an attribute on a `NoneType` object.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object is correctly utilized by `_engine_type`.
2. Handle the weak reference object to prevent it from returning `None`.

### Corrected Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    period = period_ref()  # Retrieve the referenced object
    if period is None:
        raise RuntimeError("Weak reference is no longer valid")
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This corrected function properly handles the weak reference object and ensures that the referenced object is retrieved before passing it to `_engine_type`, preventing any `NoneType` issues.
