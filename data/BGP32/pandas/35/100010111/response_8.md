### Identify potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The creation of a weak reference to `self` might not be working as expected.
2. The `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))` statement might not be handling the weak reference correctly.

### Explain the cause of the bug:
The bug seems to be related to the weak reference created in the `_engine` function. The error message points to an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, indicating that the `_engine` function is returning `None` instead of the expected object with a `view` attribute. This suggests that the weak reference handling might be incorrect, resulting in the `_engine` function not obtaining the correct object.

### Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug:
To resolve this issue, the weak reference creation and usage in the `_engine` function need to be revised. Ensure that the weak reference `period` correctly refers to `self` without any loss of reference. Additionally, the `_engine_type` function should be able to handle the weakly referenced `self` and return the appropriate object.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    result = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    if result is None:  # Check if _engine_type returned None
        return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))  # Use a proxy object
    
    return result
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we ensure that `_engine_type` receives a proxy object that maintains the weak reference to `self`. This approach should resolve the issue by ensuring that the `self` reference is correctly maintained during the computation in `_engine_type`.
