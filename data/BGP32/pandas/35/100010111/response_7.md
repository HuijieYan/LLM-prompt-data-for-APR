### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, but the return statement is passing `period` instead of `period()`. This seems to be causing the `_engine` function to receive a `NoneType` object instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by passing `period` instead of `period()` in the return statement. This results in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `NoneType` object since `period` itself is the weak reference object, not the referenced `self`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly retrieve the referenced object from the weak reference by calling `period()`. This change ensures that the `_engine` function receives the intended `self` object.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By making this change and calling `period()` to retrieve the referenced `self` object, the corrected version of the function should resolve the issue and pass the failing test for `is_monotonic` checks on multi-index levels.
