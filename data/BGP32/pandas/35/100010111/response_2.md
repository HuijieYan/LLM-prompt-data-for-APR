### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` uses a weak reference to `self` to avoid a reference cycle. However, the issue arises when the weak reference is passed to `_engine_type`, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving None instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

The error message indicates that an AttributeError is raised because a NoneType object doesn't have the 'view' attribute, which is due to the weak reference not properly maintaining the reference to `self`.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the weak reference to `self` being passed incorrectly to `_engine_type`, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving None instead of `PeriodIndex`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the weak reference should be correctly implemented to maintain a reference to `self` throughout the execution of `_engine_type`. This will ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives the `PeriodIndex` as intended.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By modifying the function to call `period()` when passing the weak reference to `_engine_type`, it ensures that the `PeriodIndex` is correctly passed instead of None. This correction should resolve the issue and enable the function to return the expected output values, satisfying the failing test and the GitHub issue.
