### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` utilizes `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object, but it seems that the weak reference is not being utilized correctly when invoking `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. This leads to an error where the `PeriodEngine` object is receiving a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

### Bug Cause:
- The weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is not being passed correctly to the `_engine_type`.
- This results in the `NoneType` error when attempting to access the `view` attribute.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is properly passed to the `_engine_type`. This can be achieved by dereferencing the weak reference before sending it to `_engine_type`.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Dereference weak reference before passing it to _engine_type
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By dereferencing `weakref.ref(self)()`, we retrieve the original `PeriodIndex` object from the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`. This corrected version should resolve the issue and ensure that the `PeriodEngine` object receives the `PeriodIndex` object as intended.
