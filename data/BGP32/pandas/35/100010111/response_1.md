### Analysis
1. The `PeriodEngine` class is expecting a weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object, but due to a bug in the `_engine` method, a regular reference to `self` is being passed.
2. The error message `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` indicates that `self._engine_type` is returning `None` instead of the expected engine.
3. The cause of the bug is that a weak reference (`weakref.ref(self)`) is not being used correctly in the `_engine` method, leading to the engine receiving a `NoneType` object. This is causing the error when trying to access the `.view()` method.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correctly use `weakref.ref` to pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`.

### Fix
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)  # Create a weak reference
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))  # Pass the weak reference object instead of self
```

### Expected corrected version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)  # Create a weak reference
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))  # Pass the weak reference object instead of self
```
