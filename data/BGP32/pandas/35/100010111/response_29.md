## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is supposed to return an instance of `self._engine_type` with a weak reference to `self` as a parameter. The error message indicates an `AttributeError`, specifically `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`. This implies that the engine object is being set to `None` instead of an actual object.

## Error Location
The error occurs at the line `period = weakref.ref(self)` where `period` is intended to be a weak reference to `self`, but it seems that this weak reference is not being used appropriately when constructing the engine object.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the weak reference `period` is not being used correctly to create the engine object, leading to the engine object being set to `None`. This causes subsequent operations on the engine object to fail with an `AttributeError`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly utilized when constructing the engine object. We should pass the weak reference `period` when creating the engine object instead of directly passing `self`.

## Bug-fixed Function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By using `period()` instead of `period` while passing to `_engine_type`, we are extracting the actual object from the weak reference and passing it to the engine type constructor. This ensures that the engine object receives a valid reference to `self`.
