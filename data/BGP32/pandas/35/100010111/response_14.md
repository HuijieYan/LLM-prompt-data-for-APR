### Analysis:
1. The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to pass a weak reference of `self` to the `_engine_type` function.
2. The error occurs when trying to access `self._engine.is_monotonic_increasing` due to a 'NoneType' object.
3. The expected input values include `self._values` as a `PeriodArray` and `self` as a `PeriodIndex`.
4. The issue on GitHub mentions that weak references are being lost, leading to the NoneType error.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference of `self` is correctly passed and maintained within the `_engine` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Make sure that the weak reference of `self` is stored properly within the `_engine` function.
2. Confirm that the `self` object retains its reference throughout the function.
3. Handle cases where the weak reference might become None or lost.
4. Update the `_engine` function to correctly handle the weak reference and prevent the 'NoneType' error.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weak reference of self to _engine_type and keep it alive
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    # Ensuring that the weak reference is still valid
    if engine is None:
        period_instance = period()
        engine = self._engine_type(period_instance, len(self))

    return engine
```

By adding a check for the weak reference in the corrected function, we ensure that the weak reference is correctly utilized and does not result in the 'NoneType' error.
