### Analysis:
1. The `_engine` function is a cached read-only property that returns an instance of `self._engine_type`. It internally uses `weakref.ref` to avoid reference cycles.
2. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` due to a `NoneType` object not having the `view` attribute.
3. The failing test involves checking if `idx2.levels` are monotonic. The issue appears to be related to losing weak references.
4. The bug arises because the weak reference to `self` in `period = weakref.ref(self)` is not properly handled, leading to `PeriodEngine` receiving a `NoneType` instead of `PeriodIndex`.
5. To fix the bug, a stronger handling of the weak reference should be implemented to ensure that a valid reference is passed to `_engine_type`.

### Bug Fix:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    period = period_ref()
    
    if period is not None:
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        raise RuntimeError("Weak reference to PeriodIndex is lost.")
```

By directly accessing the weak reference's object using `period = period_ref()`, we ensure that a valid reference to `self` is passed to `_engine_type`. If `period` is `None`, an explicit `RuntimeError` is raised to indicate the loss of the weak reference.

This fix should address the weak reference issue and resolve the `AttributeError` related to the `NoneType` object.
