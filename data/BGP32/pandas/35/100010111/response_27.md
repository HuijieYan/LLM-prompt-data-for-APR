### Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_engine` function when creating a weak reference to `self` and then passing it to `_engine_type`. The issue seems related to the weak reference not behaving as expected, resulting in `self` not being properly retained when accessed within `_engine_type`.

### Identifying the Bug
The bug seems to be related to the weak reference `period`. When passing `period` to `_engine_type`, it might not retain the reference to `self` properly, leading to a `NoneType` error.

### Error Cause
The weak reference to `self` in the `_engine` function is not being maintained properly, leading to the `NoneType` error in the `_do_monotonic_check` method when attempting to access `self._values`. This results in the AttributeError.

### Suggested Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` remains valid throughout the `_engine` function call and when accessed internally. This can be achieved by assigning the weak reference to an instance variable to keep it alive during the execution.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Assign weak reference to an instance variable to maintain its reference
    self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference as an instance variable (`self._period_ref`), we ensure that it remains valid and allows access to `self` when needed inside `_engine_type`. This correction should resolve the weak reference issue and prevent the `NoneType` error.
