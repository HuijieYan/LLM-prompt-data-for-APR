### Analysis
The `_engine` function is intended to return an instance of the `_engine_type` class with a weak reference to the period index. However, the weak reference is not being handled correctly, leading to an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` when trying to access the `self._engine` attribute.

### Error Cause
The bug is caused by the weak reference not being properly maintained, resulting in `self._engine` being `None`, leading to the AttributeError when trying to access an attribute on `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the weak reference must be properly implemented to ensure that the period index instance is maintained during the execution of the `_engine` function.

### Corrected Code
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    def create_engine(instance):
        return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(instance), len(instance))

    return create_engine(self)
``` 

By using `weakref.proxy`, we create a weak reference proxy to the `self` instance, ensuring that the instance is maintained during the `_engine` function execution. This corrected version should resolve the weak reference issue and pass the failing test cases.
