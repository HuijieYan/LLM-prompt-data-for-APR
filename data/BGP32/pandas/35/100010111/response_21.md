### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine(self)` utilizes weak referencing to avoid reference cycles.
2. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` with `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.
3. The failing test expects the correct monotonic behavior from the levels of the multi-index, which involves the `_engine` property.
4. The bug is likely caused by the weak referencing not functioning correctly, leading to `self._engine_type` receiving a `None` value.
5. To fix the bug, we should ensure that the weak referencing operation properly retains a reference to `self`.

### Correction:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period_weakref, len(self))
    
    if engine is None:
        # If _engine_type returns None, raise an AttributeError
        raise AttributeError("PeriodEngine could not be created")
        
    return engine
```

By checking if the `_engine_type` function returns `None` and handling it accordingly, we ensure that a valid engine object is returned, resolving the AttributeError issue encountered in the failing test.
