## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine(self)` is using a weak reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type` to avoid reference cycles. However, the issue arises when the weak reference `period` is being created but not used correctly, leading to an AttributeError when later operations are performed on `self`.

### Error Location
The issue lies in how the weak reference `period` is created and used improperly. The attribute access `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` leads to an error.

### Cause of the Bug
The weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object is being dropped prematurely before being used by `self._engine_type` due to the incorrect handling of the weak reference creation. This results in `self._engine` returning `None`, leading to the `PeriodEngine` operation error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To resolve the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is handled properly and passed on correctly to `_engine_type`. The weak reference creation and usage need to be corrected to maintain the reference throughout the `_engine` function's execution.

### Bug-fixed Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    def create_period_ref():
        return weakref.ref(self)

    period_ref = create_period_ref()
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

In the bug-fixed version, `create_period_ref` is a nested function that creates a weak reference to `self`. This reference is maintained until it is passed to `_engine_type`, ensuring that the `PeriodIndex` object is not dropped prematurely.
