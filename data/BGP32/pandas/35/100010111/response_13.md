### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` incorrectly, which is creating issues when retrieving the engine type later on. This leads to an AttributeError due to `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` returning `None`. The weak reference isn't behaving as intended, causing the engine type to be None, leading to the error.

### Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref`. The weak reference should be maintained to avoid reference cycles while allowing the original object to be garbage collected. However, in the buggy code, the weak reference `period` is being passed on as `self` instead of dereferencing it to get the original object.

### Strategy for Fixing
To fix this bug, the weak reference `period` needs to be dereferenced correctly to get the original object before passing it to `_engine_type`. This will ensure that the engine type receives the proper object and does not return `None`.

### Corrected Version

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

This corrected version correctly uses `weakref.proxy` to dereference the weak reference and pass the original object to the `_engine_type`. This modification will fix the bug by ensuring the engine type receives the actual object and not `None`.
