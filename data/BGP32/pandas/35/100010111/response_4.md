### Analysis:
1. The `_engine` function is designed to return an instance of `_engine_type` initialized with a weakref of `self` and the length of `self`.
2. The error message indicates that there is an issue with `return super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter().view("i8")`, where `self` appears to be None.
3. This bug results in returning NoneType instead of the expected `_engine_type` instance.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly handled and not lost in the `_engine` function.

### Bug Fix:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` instead of just `period`, we dereference the weak reference to `self`, ensuring that the instance is still alive when passed to `_engine_type`.
