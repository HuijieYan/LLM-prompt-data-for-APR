### Analysis:
1. The `_engine` function is a cached readonly property that returns the engine specific to the index.
2. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` related to `NoneType` object not having the attribute `view`.
3. The expected input values are a `PeriodArray` (`self._values`) and a `PeriodIndex` (`self`).
4. The bug seems to arise from the way the weak reference `period` is created and passed to `_engine_type`.
5. The GitHub issue confirms that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.
6. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is maintained correctly and that the `PeriodIndex` is passed without losing the reference.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the weak reference `period` being defined inside the `_engine` function but not being stored or retained anywhere, leading to the `period` being collected as garbage. This results in `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` receiving a `None` instead of the intended weak reference.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to store the weak reference `period` in a class attribute or another suitable location so that it does not get garbage collected. This will ensure that the `PeriodIndex` instance is correctly referred to when passed to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# The relative path of the file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

def _create_period_ref(self):
    self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    if not hasattr(self, '_period_ref') or self._period_ref() is None:
        self._create_period_ref()
    return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

In the corrected function:
- We use a separate method `_create_period_ref` to store the weak reference `self._period_ref` at the class level.
- Within `_engine`, we check if the weak reference exists or is still valid. If not, we recreate it using `_create_period_ref`.
- Pass the stored weak reference `_period_ref` to `_engine_type` to avoid losing the reference.

This corrected version should resolve the `AttributeError` issue and maintain the weak reference correctly to pass the failing test cases.
