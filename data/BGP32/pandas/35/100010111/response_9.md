### Analysis:
1. The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` and passing it to `_engine_type` function. 
2. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` when attempting to access the `view` attribute on a `NoneType` object.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the weak reference created using `weakref.ref(self)` is not handling the weakly referenced object properly, resulting in the `NoneType` object causing an `AttributeError` when trying to access `view`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object `self` is maintained properly, and not lost before accessing it in the `_engine` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    def ref_callback(ref):
        if self is not None:
            getattr(self, '_engine_type')[0].vgetter().view("i8") # This is a guess
    period = weakref.ref(self, ref_callback)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

The `ref_callback` function is provided to handle the weak reference, ensuring that the reference is accessible when needed in `_engine` function. This approach should resolve the issue by maintaining a valid weak reference.
