### Analyzing the buggy function
- The buggy function is `_engine` from the file `pandas/core/indexes/period.py`.
- The function uses a weak reference of `self` named `period` and passes it to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self` to create an engine object.
- The error message points to an AttributeError in the `IndexEngine.is_monotonic_increasing.__get__` method, specifically at the line `return super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter().view("i8")`.

### Error cause and potential locations
- The error occurs because the weak ref `period` is not used correctly, resulting in `self` being referenced as `None` at a deeper level causing the AttributeError.
- The cause lies in the weak reference handling and the subsequent usage of `self`.

### Bug-fixing strategy
- Ensure that the weak reference usage is correct and that it's correctly retrieved when needed to avoid `self` being referenced as `None`.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `period` is correctly called to retrieve the reference before being passed to `_engine_type`. This way, the weak reference is properly utilized, and `self` is retained as expected.
