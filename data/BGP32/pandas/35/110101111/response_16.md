To fix the bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class, the weak reference needs to be maintained properly to prevent it from getting dropped unexpectedly. The issue arises because the weak reference `period` is not stored as an attribute of the class instance, leading to it getting garbage collected prematurely.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference as an attribute of the class instance to prevent premature garbage collection
    self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference `self._period_ref` as an attribute of the class instance, we ensure that it remains alive as long as the `PeriodIndex` instance is alive. This prevents the issue of the weak reference being dropped before it is intended to be used.

The corrected version of the `_engine` function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
