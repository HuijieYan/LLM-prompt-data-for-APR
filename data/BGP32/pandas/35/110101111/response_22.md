To fix the bug in the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained correctly. The current implementation loses the weak reference causing the `_engine_type` method to receive `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex` object.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Correctly maintain the weak reference of self during the creation of the Period engine
    weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    def create_engine(period, length):
        return self._engine_type(period, length)
    
    return create_engine(weak_period, len(self))
```

This corrected version ensures that the weak reference to `self` is maintained within the `create_engine` function, which is passed to the `_engine_type` method correctly, avoiding the issue of receiving `None`.

By implementing this fix, the `test_get_level_values_when_periods` test case should pass successfully, resolving the GitHub issue related to losing weakrefs in the `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`.
