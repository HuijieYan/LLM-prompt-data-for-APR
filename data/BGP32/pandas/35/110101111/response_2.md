## Bug Explanation

The bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class arises from the fact that it attempts to create a weak reference to the `self` object using `weakref.ref(self)`, but it does not retain a strong reference to the `self` object within the function. This results in the `self` object getting garbage collected, causing a `None` to be passed to the `_engine_type` constructor. This behavior is inconsistent with the intended functionality of preserving a weak reference to `self`.

## Fix Strategy

To address this issue, the `_engine` function should store a local reference to `self` before creating a weak reference. By doing so, a strong reference to `self` will be maintained throughout the function's execution, preventing premature garbage collection.

## Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a local reference to self before creating a weak reference
    period = self
    # Pass the weak reference along with the length of the index to _engine_type
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(period), len(self))
```

By modifying the `_engine` function as shown above, the issue related to weak reference handling will be resolved, and the corrected function should now pass the failing test case.
