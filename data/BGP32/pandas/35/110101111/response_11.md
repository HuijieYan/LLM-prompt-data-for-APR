To fix the bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly maintained throughout the lifetime of the `_engine` method. The bug arises from the weakref not being fully utilized.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use a lambda function to create a weak reference to self
    period_ref = lambda: self
    
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

Explanation of the fix:
- Instead of directly applying `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference, we use a lambda function to maintain the weak reference to self.
- The lambda function `period_ref` will return `self` when called, ensuring that a reference cycle is avoided.
- This corrected version ensures that the weak reference is preserved during the execution of the `_engine` method.

The corrected function implementation should now pass the failing test case provided, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue posted on GitHub related to weak references being lost for `PeriodIndex` levels in a `MultiIndex`.
