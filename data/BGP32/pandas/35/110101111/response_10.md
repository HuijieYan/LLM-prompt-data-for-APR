Since the issue is related to weak referencing, the problem lies in how the weak reference is handled in the `_engine` calculation. The weak reference to `self` gets lost before the `_engine_type` is called, resulting in the `_engine` method not functioning as intended.

To resolve this issue, we need to maintain a reference to `self` throughout the `_engine` calculation. One way to achieve this is by storing `self` in a variable within the `_engine` function scope and using that variable during the calculation.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weak_period, len(self))
```

This correction ensures that the weak reference to `self` is maintained throughout the `_engine` calculation, addressing the issue with losing weakrefs and allowing the `_engine` method to work correctly.
