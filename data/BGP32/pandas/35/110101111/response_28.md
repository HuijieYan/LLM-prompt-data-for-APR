To fix the bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained properly. The issue arises from the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped prematurely, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

One way to address this issue is by storing the weak reference to `self` as an instance variable of the class, so that it remains available throughout the lifecycle of the `PeriodIndex` object.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# Fix for the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Maintain the weak reference to self as an instance variable
    if not hasattr(self, "_period_ref"):
        self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    
    return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference in an instance variable `_period_ref`, we ensure that the reference to `self` remains available for the `PeriodEngine` without being prematurely dropped.

This fix should resolve the issue described in the GitHub bug report and ensure that the failing test case `test_get_level_values_when_periods` passes successfully.
