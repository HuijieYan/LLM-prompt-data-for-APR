## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is returning an instance of `_engine_type` with a weak reference to `self` named `period`. However, the issue arises when `period` is being garbage collected before being passed to `_engine_type`, resulting in `_engine_type` receiving `None` instead of a proper reference to `self`. This leads to unexpected behavior and failing test cases.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `weakref.ref` object `period` does not get garbage collected prematurely. One way to achieve this is by storing the weak reference within `self` or making sure the weak reference is in scope as long as it's needed.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def _engine(self):
    # Storing the weak reference to self within the instance
    self._period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period, len(self))
``` 

By storing the weak reference `_period` within the instance, we prevent it from being garbage collected prematurely, ensuring that `_engine_type` receives a valid reference to `self`. This correction should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass successfully.
