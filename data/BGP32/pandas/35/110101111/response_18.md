To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, we need to ensure that the weak reference is correctly passed to `_engine_type` to prevent a reference cycle. The issue is related to losing weakrefs when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` in the return statement, we create a strong reference from the weak reference `period` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This will prevent the weak reference from being lost and ensure that `_engine_type` receives the `PeriodIndex` instance as intended.

This fix should resolve the issue described on GitHub and pass the failing test scenario.
