Based on the analysis of the provided buggy function, the issue arises from the fact that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped prematurely before it is intended to be used in the `PeriodEngine`, leading to `None` being passed instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`. To fix this issue, we need to modify the `_engine` function to correctly maintain the weak reference to `self`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)  # Maintain a weak reference to self
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))  # Use period() to obtain the actual reference to self
```

In this corrected version, we pass `period()` to `self._engine_type` instead of just `period`. This change ensures that we obtain the actual reference to `self` in the `PeriodEngine` by calling `period()`. This way, the weak reference is maintained properly throughout the lifespan of the `_engine` function.

By making this correction, the issue reported in the GitHub bug should be resolved, and the failing test should now pass as expected.
