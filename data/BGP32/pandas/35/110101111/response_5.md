To fix the bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class, the weak reference to the `self` object should be maintained properly to prevent a reference cycle. This bug can be fixed by updating the `_engine` function definition as follows:

```python
# Updated _engine function with fixed weak reference
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

Explanation of the fix:
- The issue was occurring because the weak reference to the `self` object was not being properly utilized in the original `_engine` function. By calling `period()` instead of passing `period` directly to the `_engine_type` constructor, the strong reference to `self` is maintained through the weak reference, resolving the bug.

This fix will ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is correctly handled, allowing the `_engine_type` constructor to receive the `PeriodIndex` object while still avoiding reference cycles.

After applying this fix, the `test_get_level_values_when_periods` test case should pass without any issues.
