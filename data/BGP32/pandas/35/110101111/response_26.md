To fix the bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly handled to avoid reference cycles. The issue is related to losing weak references during the copying of `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

To address this, we should modify the `_engine` function as follows to correctly handle the weak reference:

```python
# Updated _engine function to fix the bug
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    
    def create_engine():
        return self._engine_type(period_ref(), len(self))
    
    return create_engine
```

In this corrected version, a new `create_engine` function is defined to create the engine with the weak reference. This approach ensures that the `self` reference used in creating the engine is properly maintained without leading to a reference cycle issue.

By implementing this fix, the `PeriodEngine` will receive the expected `PeriodIndex` object instead of `None`, resolving the bug and allowing the failing test case to pass successfully.
