To fix the bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly maintained during the function's execution. The issue arises when the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object is dropped prematurely, leading to `None` being passed to the `PeriodEngine`. 

We can resolve this by modifying the `_engine` function and handling the weak reference properly. Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Maintain a weak reference to self for the duration of the function
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    
    def engine_closure(period_ref, length):
        # Use the weak reference within the closure
        period = period_ref()
        return self._engine_type(period, length)

    return engine_closure(period_ref, len(self))
```

In this corrected version:
- We create a closure `engine_closure` that captures the weak reference to `self` and uses it within the inner function to ensure that the reference is not lost prematurely.
- By executing the `engine_closure` function with `period_ref` as an argument, we maintain the reference to `self` throughout the execution.

This correction ensures that the weak reference to `self` in the `_engine` function remains valid until the `PeriodEngine` is initialized, addressing the bug and resolving the failing test case.

By applying this fix, the test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` should pass as expected, and the issue reported on GitHub regarding weakrefs in `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` should be resolved.
