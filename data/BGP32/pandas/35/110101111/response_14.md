## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is utilizing weak referencing incorrectly, leading to a reference cycle issue. The function is returning the result of `_engine_type` called with a weak reference to `self`, which causes `period` to be garbage-collected immediately and turns into `None`. This behavior results in unexpected behavior when the `PeriodEngine` is created with a `None` reference.

## Bug Cause
The bug arises from weak referencing `self` without maintaining the reference in the function. This causes the weak reference `period` to be collected prematurely, resulting in `None` being passed to `_engine_type`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the weak reference `period` needs to be stored as an instance attribute to retain the reference throughout the function's runtime. By doing this, the weak reference will not be garbage-collected prematurely, ensuring that the expected behavior is maintained.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference as an instance attribute
    self._period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
