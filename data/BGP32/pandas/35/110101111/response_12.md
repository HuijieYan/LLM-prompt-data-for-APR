To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained throughout the function. The issue arises because the weak reference is not kept properly, resulting in `period` being deleted before it is returned, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive None instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

We can resolve this by storing the weak reference in a class attribute to keep it alive throughout `_engine` function execution. This way, the weak reference won't be deleted prematurely.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a weak reference to self in the class attribute to keep it alive
    self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference to `self` in `_period_weakref` attribute, we ensure that the reference is not deleted prematurely, allowing the `PeriodEngine` to receive the correct `PeriodIndex`.

This correction should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test pass by maintaining the weak reference throughout the function.
