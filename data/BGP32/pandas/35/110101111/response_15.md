## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using a `cache_readonly` decorator, implying that it is intended to cache the result. The function is expected to return the `_engine_type` created with a weak reference to the `self` instance of `PeriodIndex`.
2. The bug is likely related to the usage of weak references and possibly incorrect handling of the weak reference to `self`.
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is trying to create a `MultiIndex` based on a `PeriodIndex` and check if the resulting levels are monotonic. The bug in `_engine` is causing issues with the weak reference to `self`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly handled to prevent unintentional reference drops.

## Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In this fix, `period()` is used to obtain the actual `self` instance from the weak reference, counteracting any potential reference drops. This ensures that the expected `self` is passed to `_engine_type`, resolving the weak reference issue identified in the bug analysis.

By making this adjustment, the function should now correctly handle the weak reference, ultimately fixing the bug reported in the failing test and the associated GitHub issue.
