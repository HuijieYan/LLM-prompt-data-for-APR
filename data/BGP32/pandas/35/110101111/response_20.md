To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained during the lifecycle of the `_engine`. The issue arises when the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped prematurely, leading to a `None` value instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

To address this issue, we can modify the `_engine` function to store the weak reference to `self` in a class attribute. This way, the reference will persist as long as the `PeriodIndex` instance exists.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a weak reference to self in the class attribute
    if not hasattr(PeriodIndex, '_weakref_self'):
        PeriodIndex._weakref_self = weakref.ref(self)
        
    return self._engine_type(PeriodIndex._weakref_self, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference to `self` in the `PeriodIndex` class attribute `_weakref_self`, we ensure that the reference is maintained throughout the lifecycle of the `PeriodIndex` instance. This modification should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the test case `test_get_level_values_when_periods` passes successfully.
