To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly maintained throughout the function execution. The issue seems to stem from the weak reference being lost prematurely, resulting in `None` being passed to `_engine_type`.

We can address this by storing the weak reference to `self` outside the function and using it when needed in the `_engine` function. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# Fix for the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)  # Store the weak reference outside the function
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

By capturing the weak reference to `self` before returning from the function, we ensure that the reference is not lost prematurely. This fix should address the issue of losing the weak reference in the `PeriodIndex` class.
