To fix the bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained properly. The issue is related to losing weakrefs during the transition to `MultiIndex`, which results in the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

One strategy to resolve this issue is to store the weak reference to `self` as an attribute of the `PeriodIndex` class, so it persists even when instances are manipulated in different contexts like creating `MultiIndex` objects.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# Updated _engine function in the PeriodIndex class
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    if not hasattr(self, '_weakref'):
        self._weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._weakref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference to `self` in the `_weakref` attribute, we ensure that the reference persists and is correctly passed to the `PeriodEngine` constructor. This modification should fix the bug and allow the `test_get_level_values_when_periods` test to pass as expected.

This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub thread "BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs." The corrected version of the `_engine` function maintains the weak reference throughout different operations involving the `PeriodIndex` instances.
