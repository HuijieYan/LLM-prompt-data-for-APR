To fix the bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained properly. The issue described in the GitHub report indicates that weak references are being lost leading to `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of a valid `PeriodIndex`.

To address this problem, we can modify the `_engine` function to store the weak reference to `self` as an instance attribute to prevent it from being lost prematurely.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a weak reference to self as an instance attribute
    if not hasattr(self, '_period_ref'):
        self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    
    return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

This modification ensures that the weak reference to `self` is maintained throughout the function's lifecycle, preventing it from being lost inappropriately. Now, the `PeriodEngine` will receive the correct reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance, resolving the weak reference issue described in the GitHub report.
