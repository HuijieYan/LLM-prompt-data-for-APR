To fix the buggy function `_engine`, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained correctly. The bug is causing the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to be dropped prematurely, leading to issues in the PeriodEngine.

To address this, we can modify the `_engine` function to store the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object within a closure. In this way, we ensure that the reference is retained as long as the `_engine` function is utilized.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a closure to hold the weak reference
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    
    def create_engine():
        # Access the period_ref from the closure
        period = period_ref()
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    return create_engine()
```

By utilizing a closure to store the weak reference within the `create_engine` function, we maintain the reference to the `PeriodIndex` object throughout the usage of the `_engine` function.

This correction should ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is not dropped prematurely, resolving the issue described in the GitHub report.
