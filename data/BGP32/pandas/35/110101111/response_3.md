To fix the bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly passed to `_engine_type`. The issue arises because the weak reference is not being handled properly, leading to `None` being passed instead of the `PeriodIndex` object.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` instead of `period`, we are retrieving the actual object that the weak reference is pointing to, which is the `PeriodIndex` object. This ensures that the `PeriodIndex` object is correctly passed to `_engine_type` and avoids passing `None`.

This correction should address the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report and ensure that the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` passes successfully.
