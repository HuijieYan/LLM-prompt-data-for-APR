To fix the bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly passed to the `_engine_type` constructor. The current implementation fails to pass the correct reference due to the way it creates the weak reference.

Here, we can modify the implementation to ensure that the weak reference is correctly handled. We can update the function as follows:

```python
# Updated corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By modifying the line `period = weakref.ref(self)` to `period = weakref.ref(self)`, we ensure that the weak reference is dereferenced properly when passed to `_engine_type`.

With this correction, the weak reference is correctly passed to the `_engine_type` constructor, resolving the issue of losing the weak reference. This correction should now allow the test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods` to pass successfully.
