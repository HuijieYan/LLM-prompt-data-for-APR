To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly maintained throughout the function. The issue arises due to the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped prematurely.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    def _create_engine(period, length):
        return self._engine_type(period, length)
    
    return _create_engine(period, len(self))
```

In this corrected version, we create a locally scoped function `_create_engine` that takes `period` and `length` as arguments before calling `self._engine_type`. This ensures that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until it's passed into `_engine_type`. By doing this, we prevent the premature dropping of the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex`.

With this correction, the `_engine` function should now preserve the weak reference as intended, resolving the issue identified in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
