I identified the potential error location in the buggy function:
- The `_engine` function uses `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` and then returns the `_engine_type` function with this weak reference and the length of `self`.
- The issue lies in the weak reference usage where the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` remains valid throughout the lifetime of the `_engine` function. One way to achieve this is to store the weak reference as an instance variable so that it maintains the reference for as long as needed.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference to self as an instance variable to maintain the reference
    self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference as `self._period_ref`, we ensure that the reference remains valid during the execution of the `_engine` function. This should resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report and pass the failing test case.
