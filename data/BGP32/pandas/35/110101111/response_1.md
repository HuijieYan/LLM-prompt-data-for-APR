To fix the bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class, we need to make sure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly passed to the `_engine_type` constructor.

In the current implementation, the weak reference `period` is not properly preserved as it is immediately called inside the `_engine_type` constructor. This causes the weak reference to `self` to be lost, resulting in the engine receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

We can resolve this issue by storing the weak reference to `self` in a local variable before passing it to the constructor. This will ensure that the weak reference remains valid during the construction of the engine object.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference in `period_ref` before passing it to the `_engine_type` constructor, we maintain the reference to the `self` instance throughout the construction process. This change should fix the bug and ensure that the weak reference behavior is correctly preserved.

This correction should address the failing test case and resolve the GitHub issue related to losing weakrefs in `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`.

This fix ensures that the weak reference to `self` is correctly maintained within the `_engine` function, resolving the issue caused by the weak reference being lost prematurely.
