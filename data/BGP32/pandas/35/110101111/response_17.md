## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using a weak reference for `self` but not handling the weak reference appropriately, leading to the `period` variable being reassigned before being used in `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `weakref.ref(self)` operation inside the `_engine` function. When the weak reference is created and returned, the reference count to the `PeriodIndex` object decreases, making it eligible for garbage collection. This results in the weak reference pointing to a non-existent object during the call to `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` does not get collected before it is used. One way to achieve this is to store the weak reference in a local variable within the `_engine` function, ensuring that the weak reference remains valid throughout the function's execution.

## Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)  # Store weak reference in a local variable
    return self._engine_type(period_weakref, len(self))
``` 

By storing the weak reference in `period_weakref` before passing it to the `_engine_type` method, we ensure that the weak reference remains valid until it is used. This corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
