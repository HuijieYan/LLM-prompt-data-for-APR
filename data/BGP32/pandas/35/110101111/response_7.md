## Bug Fix

### Issue Analysis
The issue arises from the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class. The `weakref` to `self` is created, but during the return statement, the `PeriodArray` is accessed with `len(self)` before leveraging the weak reference. This leads to a reference cycle issue and raises an error.

### Fix Strategy
To resolve the bug, we need to maintain the weak reference to `self` throughout the function, including when accessing the `PeriodArray` data. By properly utilizing the weak reference, we can prevent the reference cycle and return the correct value.

### Corrected Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```

### Expected Changes in the Corrected Function
- Instead of `self`, `self._values` should be used when determining the length for the `PeriodArray`.
- Maintain the weak reference to `self` in the `period` variable.

By making these adjustments, the bug related to weak references in the `PeriodIndex` class should be resolved.
