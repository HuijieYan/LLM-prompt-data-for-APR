To fix the bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class, the weak reference `period` should be stored outside the function scope to prevent it from being garbage collected before the engine is instantiated. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Storing the weak reference outside the function scope
    self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    period = self._period_weakref
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This modification ensures that the weak reference to `self` is kept alive until the engine is instantiated, therefore preventing the reference cycle issue that was causing the bug.

With this correction, the function should work correctly and pass the failing test case provided.
