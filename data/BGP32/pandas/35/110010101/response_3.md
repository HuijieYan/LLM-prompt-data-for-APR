### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`. The purpose is to avoid creating a reference cycle.
2. The error message indicates an AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute of a `NoneType`.
3. Possible cause of the bug:
   - The variable `period` is created using `weakref.ref(self)`, but it is not used properly when initializing `_engine_type`. This may result in the `_engine` being set to `None` instead of the expected `_engine_type`.
4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
   - Ensure that the `weakref.ref(self)` is used correctly when initializing `_engine_type` to avoid `NoneType` errors.
5. Revised version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine_type
```

By updating the buggy function to properly assign the result of `_engine_type` to `engine_type`, we can address the AttributeError issue. This fix ensures that the `_engine` function returns the expected engine type instead of `None`.
