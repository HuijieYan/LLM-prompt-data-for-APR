### Analysis
1. The `@cache_readonly` decorator suggests that the `_engine` function is designed to return a cached value which is lazy-loaded and stored for subsequent calls.
2. The error message `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` indicates that the method `view("i8")` is being called on a `NoneType` object, suggesting that the `_engine_type` method is not returning a valid object.
3. The expected input for `_engine` is an instance of `PeriodIndex` and it should return an object that can be accessed via `view("i8")`, which is typically associated with NumPy arrays.

### Bug Cause
The bug is likely due to `_engine_type` method returning `None` instead of the expected object that can be converted to `int64` view. This leads to the error when trying to access the view of `None`.

### Fix Strategy
1. Check the implementation of the `_engine_type` function to ensure it returns a valid object.
2. Consider updating the logic in `_engine_type` to correctly create and return the appropriate object rather than returning `None`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_instance = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    if engine_instance is None:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type method returned None")
    
    return engine_instance
```
