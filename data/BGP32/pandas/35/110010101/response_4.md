### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` method within the `PeriodIndex` class. It seems to be attempting to create an instance of `_engine_type` with a weak reference to `self` as an argument.
2. The error message is related to an AttributeError occurring when trying to access the `view` attribute when `self._do_monotonic_check()` is called. This implies that the `_engine` attribute is not being set correctly.
3. The cause of the bug is likely due to the weak reference usage not correctly maintaining a reference to the `self` object within the `_engine` method.
   
### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly maintained within the `_engine` method so that it can be used to create an instance of `_engine_type` without causing any attribute errors.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version above, `period` is modified to dereference the weak reference using `()` before passing it as an argument to `_engine_type`. This change ensures that the reference is valid when creating the instance.
