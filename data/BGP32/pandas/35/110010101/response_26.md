### Analyzing the buggy function and the error message

1. The buggy function `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object.
2. It then attempts to initialize `_engine_type` with this weak reference along with the length of `self`.
3. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` related to `NoneType` when trying to access the `view` attribute. This implies that the `_engine_type` function is returning `None` instead of the expected object with the `view` attribute.

### Error Explanation
The bug lies in the `_engine` function's implementation, specifically in the return statement:

```python
return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

The issue here is that the `self._engine_type` function is returning `None`, which results in the `AttributeError` when attempting to access the `view` attribute.

### Suggested Fix Strategy
To fix this bug:
1. Ensure that `_engine_type` function is correctly returning an object of the expected type.
2. Check the implementation of `_engine_type` to see why it might be returning `None`.
3. If `_engine_type` is designed to return `None`, handle this scenario in the `_engine` function so that it doesn't result in an `AttributeError`.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_instance = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    if engine_instance is None:  # Handle the case where _engine_type returns None
        raise ValueError("_engine_type returned None")
    
    return engine_instance
```

By adding a check to handle the case where `_engine_type` returns `None`, the corrected function should prevent the `AttributeError` from occurring.
