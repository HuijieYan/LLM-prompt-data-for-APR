### Fixing the bug
The bug in the provided function `_engine` is likely due to the weak reference creation process with `period = weakref.ref(self)` not being handled correctly. The error message suggests that the `view` method is being called on a `NoneType` object, causing an AttributeError.

To fix this bug, we should ensure that the weak reference `period` is correctly maintained and used within the `_engine` function. Specifically, we need to check if `period` is not `None` before further operations are performed on it.

Additionally, it seems that the `len(self)` operation is being utilized to determine the length of the `PeriodIndex`. We should ensure that `len(self)` returns the expected length.

The corrected version of the `_engine` function should handle the weak reference appropriately and ensure that any operations performed on it are valid.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        if period() is not None:
            return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
        else:
            # Handle the case where period() is None
            return None  # Or any appropriate action for handling this case
```

By incorporating the check `if period() is not None`, we can prevent the AttributeError that was encountered before. This check ensures that the weak reference `period` is valid before proceeding to create the `_engine_type` instance.

This corrected version of the `_engine` function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
