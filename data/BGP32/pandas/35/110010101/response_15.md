### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference `period`, but the reference to `period` is not used and the weak reference itself is not being accessed correctly.
2. The cause of the bug is that the function is not returning the expected value due to the incorrect usage of `weakref`.
3. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` related to a `NoneType` object not having the attribute 'view'. This error occurs when trying to access an attribute of a `NoneType` object.
4. To fix the bug, the weak reference `period` should be dereferenced properly to obtain the actual object it refers to and then utilize that object in the function instead of returning the weak reference directly.

### Bug Fix
```python
    # Fixing the buggy function    
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
