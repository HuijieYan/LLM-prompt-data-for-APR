### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine(self)` is a cached readonly function within the `PeriodIndex` class.
2. The function returns an instance of `_engine_type` passing a weak reference of `self` and the length of `self` as arguments.
3. The error message indicates an AttributeError caused by a 'NoneType' object having no attribute 'view'.
4. The issue is likely due to the weak reference handling in the `_engine` function.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` does not become `None` unexpectedly, causing the AttributeError. We can achieve this by explicitly checking if the weak reference is still alive before using it to construct the `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    if period() is None:  # Check if the weak reference is still alive
        raise RuntimeError("Weak reference is already dead.")
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
