### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class has a `@cache_readonly` decorator applied to it.
2. The function returns an instance of `_engine_type` class with arguments `period` and `len(self)`.
3. The error message indicates an issue related to returning a `NoneType` object when trying to access the `view` attribute.
4. The expected input values include a `PeriodArray` representing the periods '2019Q1' and '2019Q2', and a `PeriodIndex` instance containing these periods.
5. The expected output should be an instance of `_engine_type` class.

### Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by the return value of the `_engine` function being set to `None`, hence leading to an `AttributeError` when attempting to access the `view` attribute on a `NoneType` object.

### Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that the `weakref.ref` function correctly captures a weak reference to the `self` object.
2. Check if the `_engine_type` initialization is being done correctly with the weak reference and the length of `self`.
3. Ensure that the return value of the `_engine` function is the initialized `_engine_type` instance.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
