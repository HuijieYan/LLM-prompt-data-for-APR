### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `@cache_readonly` function that is supposed to return an `_engine_type` object by passing a weak reference of `self` and the length of the index.
2. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` at `return super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter().view("i8")`, suggesting that `self` might be `None`.
3. The cause of the bug could be that the `weakref` being created is not being correctly accessed or utilized in the `_engine` function, leading to `self` being `None` when trying to return the `_engine_type`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is correctly accessed and used to create the `_engine_type` object.

### Fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to correctly access the weak reference `period` and use it to create the `_engine_type` object.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))  # access the weak reference to get the actual object
```

By modifying the `_engine` function to access the weak reference `period` and call it to get the actual `self` object, we ensure that the correct `self` object is used to create the `_engine_type` object.
