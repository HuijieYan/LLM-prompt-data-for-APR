### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a cached readonly property that returns an instance of `self._engine_type`. In this case, `self._engine_type` expects two arguments: `period` and `len(self)`.
2. The bug seems to be occurring when trying to access the `view` attribute on a `NoneType` object, indicating that the `self._engine` property is somehow returning `None` instead of the expected engine object.
3. The bug is likely due to the use of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` within the `_engine` function. This weak reference is then passed to `self._engine_type`, which may result in `self` being garbage collected before `_engine_type` is called.
4. To fix the bug, we can ensure that `self` is not garbage collected prematurely by storing a strong reference to `self` before creating the weak reference.
5. We should modify the `_engine` function to store a strong reference to `self` before creating the weak reference and passing it to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a strong reference to self to prevent premature garbage collection
    period = self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
