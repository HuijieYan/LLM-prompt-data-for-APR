### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is supposed to return an instance of `_engine_type`, passing a weak reference of the `self` object and the length of the index.
2. The error message indicates an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` when trying to access the view method on a `NoneType` object, suggesting that the `_engine` method might be returning `None` instead of an instance of `_engine_type`.
3. This bug is likely causing the failing test due to incorrect behavior of the `_engine` method, leading to unexpected values being used in subsequent operations.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine` method returns an instance of `_engine_type` instead of `None`.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_engine` method to properly create and return an instance of `_engine_type` using a weak reference of `self` and the length of the index.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` method:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_instance = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine_instance
```

By ensuring that the `_engine` method returns `engine_instance` (an instance of `_engine_type`), we address the bug where `NoneType` was being returned instead of the correct object. This should resolve the `AttributeError` and make the function behave as intended.

By implementing this fix, the corrected function should now return the expected values and types in the failing test case, allowing it to pass successfully.
