### Analysis
1. The buggy function is `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class in the pandas library.
2. The error message indicates an AttributeError when trying to access the 'view' attribute of a 'NoneType' object.
3. The `_engine` function is returning the result of calling `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. The issue likely arises from the `period = weakref.ref(self)` line, where `period` is a weak reference to `self` instead of the actual reference.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `period` is correctly referring to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`.

### Bug Fixing Strategy
To fix the bug, we will modify the `_engine` function to ensure that `period` is referencing `self` properly before calling `_engine_type`.

### The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Pass self directly to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
