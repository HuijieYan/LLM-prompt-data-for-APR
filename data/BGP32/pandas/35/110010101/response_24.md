### Identification of potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The `_engine` function uses a `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`, but it seems to be incorrectly constructed.
2. The bug seems to be related to the `_engine_type` function being called with incorrect arguments.

### Explanation of the bug
The bug in the `PeriodIndex` class's `_engine` function is likely causing an `AttributeError`. The `weakref.ref(self)` construction seems incorrect, leading to a `NoneType` object error when trying to access an attribute that doesn't exist. This error is likely happening when the `_engine` function is attempting to call `_engine_type`.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
1. Ensure that the weak reference to `self` is constructed correctly in the `_engine` function.
2. Verify that the `_engine_type` function is being called with the appropriate arguments.

### The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
from pandas._libs.index import PeriodEngine

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return PeriodEngine(period, len(self._values))

```

By correcting the construction of the weak reference and passing the correct arguments to `_engine_type`, we aim to address the `NoneType` attribute error and ensure that the function works as expected.
