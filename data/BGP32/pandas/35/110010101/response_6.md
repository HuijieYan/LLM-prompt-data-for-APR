### Analysis:
1. The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is a cached readonly function that returns an `_engine_type` instance with a weakref of `self` passed as an argument.
2. The bug in the current implementation is that it returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` where `period` is a weakref to `self`. However, the method `_engine_type` is not implemented correctly or is returning a `NoneType`.
3. The error message indicates an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, indicating that the `_engine` is returning `None` instead of the expected `_engine_type` instance.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `_engine` correctly instantiates and returns an instance of `_engine_type` instead of returning `None`.

### Fix:
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        engine_instance = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
        if engine_instance is None:
            engine_instance = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
        return engine_instance
```

This fixed version checks if the `_engine_type` instance is None and reattempts the instantiation before returning the instance. This ensures that a valid `_engine_type` instance is returned without encountering the `AttributeError`.
