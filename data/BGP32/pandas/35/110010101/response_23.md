### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is dealing with weak references to the `self` object.
2. The error message indicates that there is an issue with trying to access the `view` attribute of a `NoneType` object.
3. The `_engine` function is used to create an engine of a specific type for the `PeriodIndex`.
4. The bug seems to occur when attempting to create the engine type.
5. The `weakref.ref(self)` should be used correctly to avoid reference cycles and ensure the `self` object is reachable.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of weak references in the `_engine` function, leading to the engine object not being created correctly, resulting in a `NoneType` object being accessed.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Ensure the weak reference is used properly to keep the `self` object reachable.
2. Verify that the engine type is being created successfully without any issues.
3. Confirm that the engine object is not becoming `None` unexpectedly.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
    return engine
```
