### Incorrect Implementation Analysis:
In the buggy function `_engine`, the issue lies in the line where `period = weakref.ref(self)` is defined. When creating a weak reference to `self`, it should be stored in a variable. However, in this implementation, the weak reference is stored in a variable called `period`, but this variable is not used afterwards. This results in the actual reference not being held on to, leading to an attribute error when trying to access the `_engine_type`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to store the weak reference to `self` in a variable that is then used to create and return the `_engine_type` object. This will ensure that the reference to `self` is held and used when accessing the necessary attributes and methods.

### Corrected Implementation:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a weak reference of self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Access the weak reference when creating the _engine_type object
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
