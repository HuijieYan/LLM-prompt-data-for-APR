### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `_engine` function is likely caused by the incorrect initialization of the `period` object with a weak reference to `self`. In the buggy implementation, the `weakref.ref(self)` is assigned to `period`, but the weak reference is not being properly utilized later when creating the `_engine_type` object. This leads to a `NoneType` error when attempting to access an attribute of the weak reference.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly utilize the weak reference created using `weakref.ref` to access the object it references. This will ensure that the object is properly retained in memory while avoiding the reference cycle issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))  # Utilize the weak reference properly by calling it to obtain the object
```
