The buggy function `_engine` is trying to create an instance of `self._engine_type` class by passing a weak reference of `self`, but it seems that the weak reference is not being correctly utilized, leading to an AttributeError when trying to access an attribute of a NoneType object.

To fix this issue, we should ensure that the weak reference is properly maintained and resolved to the original object before accessing any attributes. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    period_obj = period()
    return self._engine_type(period_obj, len(self))
```

By resolving the weak reference `period` to `period_obj` before passing it to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the original `self` object is correctly used in the `_engine_type` initialization process. This should resolve the AttributeError issue during the failing test execution.
