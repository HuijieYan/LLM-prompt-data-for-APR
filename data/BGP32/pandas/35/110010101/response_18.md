### Error Analysis
- In the buggy function `_engine`, the `weakref.ref(self)` is called to create a weak reference to the `self` object which is a `PeriodIndex` instance. The intention seems to be avoiding potential reference cycles.
- However, the issue arises when returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, as it seems that `self._engine_type` is not correctly handling the weak reference object `period`, resulting in an AttributeError when trying to access the `.view()` method on a `NoneType` object.

### Bug Cause
- The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of the weak reference object `period` passed to `self._engine_type` in the `_engine` function.
- The `_engine_type` function may not correctly handle receiving a weak reference object instead of an actual reference, leading to the `NoneType` object error.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
- Instead of passing `weakref.ref(self)` to `_engine_type`, the corrected version should pass `self` directly after resolving the weak reference, so that `_engine_type` receives the actual `PeriodIndex` instance.
- Make sure `_engine_type` is able to handle weakly referenced objects correctly.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)()  # Resolve weak reference to get the actual object
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
