### Correction strategy
The error message indicates that the `_engine` method is returning a `NoneType` object, which is leading to the `AttributeError`. This could be due to an issue in the way the weak reference is being created inside the `_engine` method.

To fix this bug, we need to properly create the weak reference to the `self` object and ensure that it does not become `None`. One way to do this is by storing the weak reference in a variable outside of the return statement so that it remains in scope and doesn't get garbage collected.

### The corrected version of the function

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

By storing `weakref.ref(self)` in `period_ref` before returning, the weak reference to `self` is maintained and prevents it from becoming `None`, thus resolving the `AttributeError` issue.
