### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `self` to create a weak reference, which can potentially result in a reference cycle.
2. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` with a `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`. This suggests that the `_engine` attribute is returning `None` instead of the expected type.
3. The expected behavior of the `_engine` function is to create an instance of `PeriodEngine` using the weak reference of `self` and the length of the index.
4. The bug can be fixed by ensuring that the weak reference is correctly passed to the `_engine_type` constructor.

### Fix
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
