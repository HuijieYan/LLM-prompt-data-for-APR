### Analysis
1. The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is not necessary as `weakref.ref(self)` returns a weak reference object.
2. The bug is likely caused by passing the weak reference object `period` to `self._engine_type` instead of passing `self` directly.
3. The error message indicates that `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, which suggests that the `_engine` function is returning `None` instead of the expected `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.
4. The fix is to pass `self` directly to `self._engine_type` instead of passing the weak reference object.

### Fix
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
