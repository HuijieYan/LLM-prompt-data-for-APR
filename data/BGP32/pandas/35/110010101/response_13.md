### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `@cache_readonly` function that returns a `_engine_type` object. The bug likely arises from the way the `weakref` is being used to pass `self` to `_engine_type`.

2. The error message mentions an AttributeError related to a 'NoneType' object not having an attribute 'view'. This indicates that the `self._engine_type` is somehow not being properly initialized or returned as expected.

### Bug cause
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref(self)` inside the `_engine` function. The `weakref.ref` function returns a weak reference object pointing to `self`, but it should be used properly to obtain the actual reference when needed.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, instead of just storing the weak reference to `self` in a local variable `period`, the reference should be dereferenced properly using `period()` when it needs to be passed as an argument to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
