### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is attempting to create a weak reference to the `self` object by using `weakref.ref(self)` and then passing it to `_engine_type` constructor. This is intended to avoid reference cycles. However, the bug arises from the fact that the `weakref.ref()` function is returning a weak reference object and not the actual object, which causes an `AttributeError` when trying to access attributes or methods on it.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix this issue, we need to modify the `_engine` function to extract the actual object from the weak reference before returning it. This can be done by calling the `weakref.ref(self)` object itself, which returns the actual object. Then, this object can be passed to `_engine_type` constructor.

### Corrected Implementation
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Extract the actual object from the weak reference
    period = weakref.ref(self)()

    if period is not None:
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        return None
``` 

By using `weakref.ref(self)()` to extract the actual object from the weak reference, we ensure that the returned value to `_engine_type` is the actual `PeriodIndex` object, not a weak reference object, which should prevent the `AttributeError` in the failing test.
