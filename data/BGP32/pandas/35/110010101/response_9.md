The buggy function `_engine` is attempting to create an instance of `self._engine_type` by passing a weak reference of `self` and the length of `self` as arguments. However, there is an issue with creating a weak reference to `self` in this context, leading to the error message `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.

The cause of this bug is related to how the weak reference is being created for `self`. Due to the way weak references work in Python, the reference is not being stored correctly, resulting in a `NoneType` object when trying to access attributes like `view`.

To fix this bug, we need to store a strong reference to `self` before creating a weak reference. This will ensure that `self` is not garbage-collected prematurely and can be accessed properly in the `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    strong_self = self
    period = weakref.ref(strong_self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(strong_self))
``` 

By storing a strong reference to `self` before creating the weak reference, we prevent the premature garbage collection of `self`. This should resolve the issue and allow the function to work correctly in all test cases.
