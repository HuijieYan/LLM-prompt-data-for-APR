### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class is supposed to return an instance of the `_engine_type` class with a weak reference to `self`.
2. The error message indicates that an `AttributeError` occurs because the `_engine` method is producing a `NoneType` object instead of the expected `_engine_type` object.
3. The expected input values are a `PeriodArray` representing the periods and a `PeriodIndex` object, but the buggy function is not correctly returning the `_engine_type` instance.
4. The bug is likely due to a problem in the instantiation of the `_engine_type` object and the use of weak reference.
5. To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should correctly construct and return an instance of the `_engine_type` class.

### Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By ensuring that the `_engine_type` object is properly instantiated and passed the weak reference of `self`, the bug should be fixed.
