### Analysis
1. The `PeriodIndex` class contains a `_engine` function that is using `weakref.ref(self)` to avoid reference cycles. This function is supposed to return `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.
2. The error message indicates that the issue is with the `return super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter().view("i8")` line, specifically where `self` is a NoneType object.
3. The cause of the bug seems to be that `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` is not correctly initialized, leading to `self` being `None` in the subsequent code.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `_engine_type` is correctly initialized with the weak reference of `self` before returning it.

### Solution
We can fix the buggy function by modifying the `_engine` function to correctly initialize `_engine_type` with the weak reference of `self`.

### The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
