### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` decorator that returns an instance of `_engine_type` using a weak reference of `self`.
2. The error message indicates that the `AttributeError` is raised because the `_engine` method returns `NoneType`. This implies that the `_engine_type` is not being initialized correctly.
3. The cause of the bug could be related to the weak reference usage or the initialization of the `_engine_type`.
4. To fix the bug, you need to ensure that the weak reference is correctly passed to `_engine_type` and that the `_engine_type` instance is initialized properly.

### Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` instead of just `period`, the weak reference is called to return the actual object referenced, which should resolve the issue with the `NoneType` error.
