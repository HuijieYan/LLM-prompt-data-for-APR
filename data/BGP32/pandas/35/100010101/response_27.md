### Analysis
1. The error message is pointing to an AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view', which occurs in the function `return super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter().view("i8")`.
2. This error suggests that the `vgetter()` method is returning a NoneType object, leading to the AttributeError when trying to access the `view("i8")` attribute.
3. The function `_engine` is implemented as a `@cache_readonly` decorator, which is used for caching the return value of the function. However, it seems that the issue lies in the instantiation of `period` using `weakref.ref(self)`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine` function is returning a valid object and not just a reference.
5. In this case, we should directly pass `self` to `_engine_type` without creating a weak reference.

### Fixing the Bug
```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
``` 

By directly passing `self` instead of `weakref.ref(self)` to `_engine_type`, we avoid the `NoneType` object error and provide a valid input object.
This should resolve the AttributeError issue and ensure that the `_engine` function returns a valid object for further operations.
