### Explanation:
The bug in the `_engine` function is causing an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error when trying to access the `view` attribute of a `None` object. This error is likely due to the `_engine_type` function not returning a valid object, resulting in `None` being returned.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `_engine_type` function returns a valid object that can be used to access the `view` attribute without any issues.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type function returned None")
    return engine
``` 

By adding a check for `None` before returning the engine object, we can ensure that a valid object is returned and no `NoneType` errors occur.
