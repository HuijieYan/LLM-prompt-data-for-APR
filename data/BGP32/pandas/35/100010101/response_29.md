### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` and then passing it to `_engine_type` method. However, the error message indicates that the issue is with `self._engine.is_monotonic_increasing`, specifically, `self._engine` being of type `NoneType`. This implies that `_engine_type` is returning `None` instead of an actual engine object, leading to the error.

### Bug Cause
The buggy function is not returning the expected engine object from `_engine_type`. Instead, it is returning `None`.

### Fix Strategy
Ensure that `_engine_type` returns the correct engine object and not `None`. This can be achieved by validating the return value of `_engine_type` before returning it from the `_engine` function.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is not None:
        return engine
    else:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type returned None instead of an engine object.")
