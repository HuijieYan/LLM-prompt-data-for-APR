### Analysis
- The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self` and then passing it to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`.
- The error message indicates an `AttributeError` with 'NoneType' object, suggesting that the `_engine` function is returning `None` instead of the expected value.
- The expected input values include a `PeriodArray` stored in `self._values` and a `PeriodIndex` stored in `self`.
- The current implementation of `_engine` is not correctly returning the engine object, which is resulting in the `NoneType` error when trying to access attributes on it.

### Bug Cause
- The bug is caused by returning only the weak reference object instead of properly creating and returning the `_engine_type` object using the weak reference.
- The weak reference object itself does not provide the necessary access to attributes required by the caller, leading to the `NoneType` error.

### Fix Strategy
- The `weakref.ref` function creates a weak reference to an object. To access the original object, it should be dereferenced using the `()` operator on the weak reference.
- Modify the `_engine` function to correctly dereference the weak reference and return the `_engine_type` object.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

By dereferencing the weak reference `period` using `period()`, the corrected version ensures that the `_engine_type` object is created and returned as expected, fixing the bug.
