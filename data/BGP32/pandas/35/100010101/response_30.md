### Explanation
The error message indicates that there is an issue with referencing a `NoneType` object in the `PeriodEngine` class. This error occurs because the `_engine` method is returning `None` instead of the expected `PeriodEngine` object.

### Bug Location
The bug is in the `_engine` method where a weak reference is being created for the `self` object but is not properly used to initialize the `PeriodEngine`.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by not correctly passing the weak reference to the `_engine_type` constructor, resulting in `None` being returned instead of the expected `PeriodEngine` object.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_engine` method to correctly pass the weak reference to initialize the `PeriodEngine`. This will ensure that the `PeriodEngine` object is created properly and returned by the `_engine` method.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))()
```
