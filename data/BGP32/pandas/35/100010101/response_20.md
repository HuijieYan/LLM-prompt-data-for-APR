### Bugs in the Buggy Function:
1. The variable `period` is assigned to `weakref.ref(self)`, which creates a weak reference to `self` instead of passing a weak reference to `_engine_type`.
2. The return statement is using `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, which is incorrect because `period` is a weak reference.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the assignment of the `period` variable to actually create a weak reference to `self`.
2. Modify the return statement to correctly pass the weak reference to `_engine_type`.

### The Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
