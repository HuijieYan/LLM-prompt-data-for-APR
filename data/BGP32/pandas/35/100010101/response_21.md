### Analysis
The error message indicates an AttributeError related to a 'NoneType' object not having the 'view' attribute. This suggests that the `_engine` function is returning `None` instead of the expected engine type.

### Bug
The bug in the `_engine` function is that the `weakref.ref(self)` statement creates a weak reference to `self`, but it doesn't retain a strong reference. This leads to the `period` being garbage collected and resulting in `None` being returned.

### Fix
To fix this bug, we need to retain a strong reference to `period` while still utilizing a weak reference to avoid a reference cycle. One way to do this is by assigning `period` to an instance attribute of the `_engine` function.

### Corrected code
```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    self._period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period, len(self))
``` 

By storing the weak reference in `self._period`, we ensure that the weak reference doesn't get garbage collected prematurely. This should fix the issue and the function should now return the correct engine type.
