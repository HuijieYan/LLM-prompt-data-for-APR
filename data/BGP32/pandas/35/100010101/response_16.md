### Potential Error Location
The bug seems to be in the `_engine` function where it returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. This might be causing an issue with the `self._engine_type()` function or how it handles the `period` argument.

### Bug Explanation
The error message `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` suggests that the `_engine_type` method returns `None`, which causes the subsequent `.view("i8")` call to fail. This indicates that the `_engine_type` method is not returning the expected object.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Check the implementation of the `_engine_type` method to ensure it is returning a valid object.
2. If the `_engine_type` method is supposed to return an object that supports `.view("i8")`, make sure it does so correctly.
3. Ensure that the `period` argument is being passed correctly to the `_engine_type` method.

### The Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type should not return None")
    return engine
```

By explicitly checking if the `_engine_type` method returns `None` and raising a `ValueError` in that case, we ensure that the function does not attempt to access attributes on a `NoneType` object.
