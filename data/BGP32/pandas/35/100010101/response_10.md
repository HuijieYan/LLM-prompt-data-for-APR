### Analysis
- The error message indicates an `AttributeError`, specifically `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.
- The function `_engine` uses a weak reference to `self`, which might be causing an issue when trying to access attributes or methods of `self`.
- The error occurs when trying to return `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, suggesting an issue with the creation or usage of `self._engine_type`.
- The expected input values involve a `PeriodArray` and a `PeriodIndex`, indicating that the function should handle period-related data structures.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- The issue seems to be related to the usage of weak references with `_engine_type`. We need to ensure that the weak reference is being used correctly and provides the necessary information to `self._engine_type`.
- One possible solution is to use weak references appropriately, so that the required attributes/methods of `self` are accessible.
- It might also be necessary to check the implementation of `self._engine_type` to see how it interacts with the weak reference provided.
- The corrected function should properly handle the weak reference and any associated attributes/methods.

### Corrected Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self), show_warning=False)
```

In the corrected version, we are passing `period` and the length of `self` to `_engine_type`, along with `show_warning=False` as an additional argument. This should help in resolving any issues related to weak referencing and accessing 'NoneType' objects.
