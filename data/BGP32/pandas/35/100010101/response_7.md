### Explanation:
The bug in the code is that the `weakref.ref(self)` is being assigned to `period`, but it should actually be assigned to `period()` to create a weak reference object. This is causing the `_engine` method to return `None` instead of the expected `_engine_type` object, leading to the `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error message.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to correctly assign a weak reference object to `period` by calling `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference object. This will ensure that the `_engine` method returns the expected `_engine_type` object instead of `None`.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

By making this correction, the function will now correctly create a weak reference object and return the `_engine_type` object as expected, resolving the `AttributeError` issue.
