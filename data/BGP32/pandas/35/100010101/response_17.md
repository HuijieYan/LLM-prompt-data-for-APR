### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `_engine` function arises from the fact that the weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` is created but not properly used when calling `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. This results in the `self._engine` being set to `None` instead of the expected value, causing the AttributeError when trying to access an attribute of `None`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is properly dereferenced when calling `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. This involves using `period()` to access the original object referenced by the weak reference.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

By using `period()` to dereference the weak reference, we ensure that the original object is passed to `_engine_type` instead of `None`, fixing the bug and allowing the function to work as intended.
