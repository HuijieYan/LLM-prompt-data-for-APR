### Analysis
- The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object, which is a `PeriodIndex` object.
- The error message indicates an `AttributeError` on a `NoneType` object, suggesting that the `_engine_type` method is returning `None` instead of an actual object.
- The returned value from `_engine_type` should not be `None` and should be an object that has a `view` method, as the error message suggests.
  
### Bug Cause
- The bug is caused because the `_engine_type` method is returning `None` instead of a valid object, leading to an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` method on a `NoneType`.

### Fix Strategy
- Verify the implementation of the `_engine_type` method to ensure that it correctly returns an object instance.
- Update the `_engine` function to handle the case where `_engine_type` returns `None` by either raising an error or handling it gracefully.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type should not return None.")
        
    return engine
```
