### Cause of the Bug
The bug in the `_engine` function is caused by the fact that `weakref.ref()` returns a weak reference object and not the actual object itself. When `self` is passed to `_engine_type`, it is expecting the actual object, but instead, it is receiving a weak reference object which leads to the `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to dereference the weak reference object obtained from `weakref.ref(self)` and pass the actual object to `_engine_type`.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Dereference the weak reference to get the actual object
    period = self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By directly passing `self` as `period`, we ensure that the actual object is passed to `_engine_type` instead of a weak reference object. This should fix the bug and the function will return the expected output.
