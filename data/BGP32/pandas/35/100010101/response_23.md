### Analysis
The function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` incorrectly by passing `self` directly to create a weak reference instead of passing the object to which the weak reference will be created. This is causing an `AttributeError` when attempting to access the weak reference object.

### Bug
The bug is caused by passing `self` directly to `weakref.ref`. This results in a weak reference that does not behave as expected when trying to access its attributes or methods.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we should pass `self` to `weakref.ref` as an argument to create a weak reference to the `self` object correctly.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to the 'self' object
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By making this correction, the function will correctly create a weak reference to the `self` object, avoiding the `AttributeError` mentioned in the failing test.
