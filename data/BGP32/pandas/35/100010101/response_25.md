### Explanation
The error message `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` indicates that the `_engine` function is returning a `NoneType` object instead of the expected engine type. This is causing an attribute error when trying to access the `.view("i8")` attribute.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference `period` is not correctly capturing a reference to `self`. As a result, when `self` is passed to `_engine_type`, it is not being properly used to create the engine, leading to the function returning `None`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` correctly captures a reference to `self` and is used properly to create the engine type in `_engine`.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.proxy(self)  # Use weakref.proxy to capture a reference to self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, we are ensuring that `period` maintains a strong reference to `self`. This should fix the bug and allow the function to return the correct engine type.
