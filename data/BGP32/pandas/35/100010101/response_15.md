### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` currently returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, where `period` is generated with `weakref.ref(self)`. 
The error message indicates an `AttributeError` related to `NoneType` object in the method `view("i8")`, implying that the `_engine_type` is returning a `None` object instead of the expected type.
This issue might arise from the way the weak reference is being handled or due to an improper initialization of `_engine_type`.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused due to the weak reference `period` not being correctly utilized when passing into `_engine_type`, which results in `_engine_type` returning `None` instead of the expected object.

### Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that the weak reference `period` is properly dereferenced before passing it to `_engine_type`.
2. Check the implementation of `_engine_type` to ensure it returns the correct type/object.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if period else None
``` 

This correction correctly dereferences the weak reference `period` before passing it to `_engine_type`. If the weak reference is valid (not `None`), `_engine_type` will be called with the correct reference, otherwise it will return `None`.
