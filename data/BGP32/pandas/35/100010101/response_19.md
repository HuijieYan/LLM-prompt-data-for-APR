### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to self, but it is not being used correctly when calling `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.
2. The error message indicates an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, which suggests that the `_engine_type` is returning `None`.
3. The expected input values are `self._values` and `self` which are of types `PeriodArray` and `PeriodIndex` respectively. The goal is to return a valid engine type based on these inputs.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `_engine` function correctly handles the weak reference creation and subsequent usage when calling `_engine_type`.

### Fix
To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, we need to modify how the weak reference is used and ensure that `_engine_type` does not return `None`. Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    
    engine = self._engine_type(period_ref(), len(self))
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type returned None")
    
    return engine
```

This fix addresses the issue by properly utilizing the weak reference and explicitly handling the case when `_engine_type` returns `None`. This corrected version should resolve the `AttributeError` and satisfy the expected input/output values.
