### Analyzing the buggy function and error message
The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self` and then using it to instantiate a new object of `self._engine_type`. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` with the message `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`. This suggests that the `_engine_type` object is not properly instantiated and is returning `None`.

### Error location
The issue seems to be with the instantiation of the `_engine_type` object using the weak reference to `self`.

### Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by not properly dereferencing the weak reference before using it to instantiate the `_engine_type` object. This leads to the `_engine` function returning `None` instead of the expected engine object.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to properly dereference the weak reference `period` before using it to instantiate the `_engine_type` object. This can be done by calling `period()` to get the actual reference to `self`.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` to properly dereference the weak reference, we ensure that the actual `self` object is passed to the `_engine_type` instantiation, fixing the bug.
