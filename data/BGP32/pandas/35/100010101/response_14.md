### Analysis
- The buggy function `_engine` is supposed to return the engine type associated with the PeriodIndex.
- The error message indicates an `AttributeError` related to a `NoneType` object not having the attribute `view`.
- The bug seems to arise from the `_do_monotonic_check` method in the `IndexEngine`.
- The weak reference usage in the `_engine` function might not be correctly handling the reference to `self`, leading to the `NoneType` error.

### Bug Cause
The weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` might be implemented incorrectly, leading to the engine object (self._engine_type) not being correctly referenced when the function is called later.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we should ensure that the weak reference `period` correctly references `self` so that the engine object is retained. One way to achieve this is to modify the weak reference creation and retrieval in the `_engine` function.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use a weak reference to avoid a reference cycle
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we create a weak reference that allows access to the original object without the need to call additional methods like `is_monotonic_increasing`. This should resolve the `NoneType` error and correctly handle the engine object reference.
