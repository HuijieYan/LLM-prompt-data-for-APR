### Analysis
- The buggy function `_engine` is trying to create a weak reference to `self` and pass it to `_engine_type`.
- The error message indicates an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, which suggests that `_engine_type` is returning `None`.
- This means that `self._engine_type()` is not returning a valid object.
- The bug is likely in how `_engine_type` is constructed or initialized, resulting in it not returning the expected object.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Check the implementation of `_engine_type` to ensure it returns a valid object.
- Make sure that `_engine_type` is properly initialized with the weak reference to `self`.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if self._engine_type is not None else None
```

By adding a check for `self._engine_type` not being None before calling it, we prevent the error caused by it returning None. This fix should resolve the `AttributeError` issue and allow the function to behave as expected.
