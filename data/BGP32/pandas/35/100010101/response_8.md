### Analysis
- The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is intended to avoid reference cycles.
- The error message states that a `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, indicating that `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` is returning `None`, causing the error when trying to access an attribute on `None`.
- This error is likely due to the `_engine_type` not returning a valid object as expected.
- To fix this, we need to ensure that `_engine_type` returns a valid object instead of `None`.

### Fixing the bug
1. Check the implementation of `_engine_type` to ensure it returns a valid object.
2. If `_engine_type` is not returning a valid object, modify it to return the correct object based on the input arguments.
3. Make sure that the correct object returned by `_engine_type` can be used further in the function.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type returned None, which is invalid.")
    
    return engine
``` 

In this corrected version, we explicitly check if the `_engine_type` function returns `None` and raise a `ValueError` if that happens. This will ensure that the `_engine` function only returns a valid object.
