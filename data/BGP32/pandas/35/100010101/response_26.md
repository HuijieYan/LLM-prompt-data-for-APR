### Analysis
1. The error message is pointing to an AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view', which indicates that a NoneType object is being used where an attribute 'view' is expected.
2. The bug seems to be related to the `_engine_type` function not returning the expected object.
3. The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object, but the return value (`self._engine_type(period, len(self))`) is not guaranteed to be a valid object.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check the implementation of `_engine_type` to make sure it returns a valid object.
2. Make sure that the `_engine` function returns a specific type of object that has the `view` attribute.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_obj = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine_obj is None:
        return None  # Handle case where _engine_type returns None
    return engine_obj
```
