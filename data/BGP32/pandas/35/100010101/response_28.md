### Analysis
- The `_engine` function seems to be trying to create an instance of the `_engine_type` class using a weak reference to `self`.
- The error message indicates that `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, implying that the `_engine` is returning `None`.
- This bug might be caused by the weak reference usage or the way the `_engine_type` is being instantiated.
- To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is correctly used and that the `_engine_type` instantiation is done properly.

### Fixing the Bug
1. Ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly used to avoid reference cycles.
2. Check the instantiation of the `_engine_type` and make sure it is returning the intended object rather than `None`.

### The Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_instance = self._engine_type(period(), len(self))  # Calling the weak reference to get the actual object
    return engine_instance
``` 

By modifying the `_engine` function to correctly call the weak reference and instantiate the `_engine_type` object properly, the bug should be fixed.
