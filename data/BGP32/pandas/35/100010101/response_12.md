### Explanation:
The `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error message indicates that the `_get_index_values()` method is returning a `NoneType`, which does not have the `view` attribute. This can happen if the `_engine` method returns `None` instead of the expected engine type.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the `_engine` method returns the correct engine type.
2. Make sure that the weak reference to `self` is used correctly within the `_engine` method.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period(), len(self))  # Use the weakref to get the actual instance
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("Failed to create engine")
    return engine
``` 

By ensuring that the weak reference is called to get the actual instance and checking for `None` values before returning the engine, we can fix the bug and prevent the `AttributeError` from occurring.
