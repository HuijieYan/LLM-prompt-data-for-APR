### Analysis
- The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference of `self`, which is then passed to `_engine_type` to avoid reference cycles.
- The error message points to an issue where a `NoneType` object does not have the `view` attribute, likely caused by `_engine` not returning the expected object.
- The expected input values involve a `PeriodArray` and a `PeriodIndex` object.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- The function needs to return the correct object to avoid the `NoneType` error.
- Ensure that the `_engine` function returns the appropriate object to resolve the issue.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, the corrected function returns the reference correctly, resolving the `NoneType` error.
