### Analysis
- The `_engine` method is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to self which is causing an issue with the further operations.
- The error message indicates an `AttributeError` related to the `_engine` object being of type `NoneType` and lacking the attribute `view`.

### Bug Cause
The weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` is not being used correctly which results in an issue when trying to access the `_engine` object later on.

### Fix Strategy
Instead of creating a weak reference to `self`, it's better to directly pass `self` to the `_engine_type` function within the `_engine` method.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected _engine method
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
