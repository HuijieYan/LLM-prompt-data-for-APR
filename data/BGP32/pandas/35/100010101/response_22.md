### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref()` to create a weak reference to `self`, but it's not correctly passing it to `_engine_type`. This is causing an issue when trying to access attributes of the weak reference in the subsequent code.
- The error message indicates that the function is returning a `NoneType` object, which is causing an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute on it.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by not correctly passing the weak reference `period` to the `_engine_type` constructor, which is resulting in a `NoneType` object being returned by the function instead of the expected engine object.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, ensure that the weak reference `period` is correctly passed to the `_engine_type` constructor to avoid returning a `NoneType` object.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Correctly pass the weak reference to _engine_type
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
