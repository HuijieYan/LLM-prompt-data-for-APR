### Analysis
- The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`, but it is not correctly passing it to `_engine_type`.
- The error message suggests that the `_engine` attribute is returning `None`, leading to the `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.
- The expected input values are a `PeriodArray` and a `PeriodIndex`.
- To fix the bug, we need to correctly pass the weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type` and ensure that the `_engine` attribute returns a valid object.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Modify the `_engine` function to correctly pass the weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`.
- Ensure that the `_engine` attribute returns a valid object during its execution.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
