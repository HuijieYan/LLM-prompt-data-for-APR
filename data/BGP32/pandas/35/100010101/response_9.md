### Analysis
1. The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` and then passing it to `_engine_type`. This might be causing the issue with accessing attributes/methods of the original object.
2. The error message indicates that `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, which means the `_engine` attribute is returning `None`.
3. The expected input values are `self._values` as a `PeriodArray` and `self` as a `PeriodIndex` object.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine` attribute is correctly initialized and not returning `None`.

### Bug Fix
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we can pass a weak proxy reference to `_engine_type` while ensuring that the original `self` object is accessible. This should fix the issue with the weak reference cycle and prevent the `NoneType` error.
