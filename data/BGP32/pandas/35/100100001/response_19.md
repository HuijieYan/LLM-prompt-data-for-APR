## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a cache readonly function that is used within the pandas package for handling PeriodIndex.
2. The function is supposed to create an instance of `_engine_type` with a weak reference to self (PeriodIndex) and the length of self.
3. The failing test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is checking if the level values of a MultiIndex created from PeriodIndex instances are monotonic.
4. The bug occurs when the `_engine` function in the `period.py` file is not creating the `_engine_type` instance correctly, leading to failures in the test.

## Bug:
The bug in the `_engine` function is that it is using `weakref.ref(self)` incorrectly. Instead of passing the weak reference of `self`, it should be passing the actual object `self` to the `_engine_type` constructor, which causes the test to fail.

## Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to pass `self` directly to the `_engine_type` constructor instead of a weak reference to self. This will ensure that the `_engine_type` instance is created correctly with the actual object.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
