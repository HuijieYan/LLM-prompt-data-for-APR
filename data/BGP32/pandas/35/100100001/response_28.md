### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` on `self` to avoid a reference cycle.
2. The test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is testing the behavior of `PeriodIndex` and is expecting all levels to be monotonic.

### Identified Issue:
The issue in the buggy function `_engine` lies in the usage of `weakref.ref(self)`. This creates a weak reference to `self`, which might not hold a strong reference to the object being referenced, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the weak reference not properly referencing `self`. This can cause issues when calling methods or attributes on `self`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function `_engine` should return the `self` object directly instead of creating a weak reference.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By returning `self` directly, the corrected function now returns the actual object `self` without creating a weak reference. This should fix the bug and ensure proper behavior when calling methods or attributes on `self`.
