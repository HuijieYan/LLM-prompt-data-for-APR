The bug lies in the `_engine` function where a weak reference to `self` is created but not correctly used. The correct usage should involve dereferencing the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
from pandas import Period
from pandas.core.indexes.multi import MultiIndex

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Dereference the weak reference to avoid reference cycle
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In this corrected version, `weakref.ref(self)()` is used to dereference the weak reference and obtain the object it refers to before passing it to `_engine_type`. This fix ensures that the potential reference cycle issue is resolved, and the code should pass the failing test case.
