## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` decorator function that returns the `_engine_type` attribute of the object.
2. The `_engine` function creates a weak reference of `self` and passes it to `_engine_type`.
3. The failing test involves creating a `MultiIndex` object from `PeriodIndex` objects and accessing the level values.
4. The failing test is related to handling `Period` objects in `MultiIndex`.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug is likely occurring due to the way the weak reference is being created and passed to `_engine_type`. This might be causing issues with object reference handling, especially when dealing with `Period` objects in the `MultiIndex`.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference creation and usage is done correctly in the `_engine` function. This will help in avoiding reference cycle issues and potential bugs related to object handling.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we are now passing the result of `period()` (which calls the weak reference to get the actual object) to `_engine_type` instead of the weak reference itself. This ensures that the correct object reference is passed and should fix the bug.
