## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is an instance of a class. The weak reference is then passed to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`.
2. The potential error location is with the use of `weakref.ref` which might not correctly create a weak reference to `self`.
3. The bug in the function results in incorrect behavior when constructing a weak reference. This can lead to unexpected results or failures in the test case.
4. To fix the bug, we should create a proper weak reference to `self` and ensure that it is correctly passed to `_engine_type`.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Creating a proper weak reference to self using weakref.ref
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, we can create a proper weak reference to `self` which will not prevent the object from being garbage collected. This should fix the bug and make the function behave as expected.
