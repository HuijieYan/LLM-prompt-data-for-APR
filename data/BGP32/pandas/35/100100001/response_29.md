## Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is the instance of the class. This weak reference is then passed to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`. The intention seems to be to avoid creating a reference cycle.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is trying to create a `MultiIndex` from `PeriodIndex` objects and then ensure that the levels are monotonic. The bug seems to be related to the method `_engine` not functioning correctly, possibly leading to incorrect behaviour in the creation of the `MultiIndex`.

## Error location:
The potential error in the buggy function is with the usage of `weakref.ref(self)`. Instead of creating a weak reference to `self`, it should actually be creating a weak reference to `_engine_type`, assuming that `_engine_type` is a class or function.

## Bug cause:
The bug causes incorrect behaviour because the weak reference `period` is being passed to `_engine_type` instead of a weak reference to the correct object. This leads to unexpected behaviour in the creation of the `MultiIndex` in the test function.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the weak reference creation to target the appropriate object (likely `_engine_type`) instead of the instance `self`. By correcting this, the `MultiIndex` creation in the test function should behave as expected.

## Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of _engine_type.
    engine_type = weakref.ref(self._engine_type)
    return engine_type(len(self))
```

By making this change, the corrected function should now pass the failing test.
