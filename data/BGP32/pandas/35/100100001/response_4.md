### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is the `PeriodIndex` instance. This is an attempt to avoid reference cycles.
2. The function then tries to pass this weak reference to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`.
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is focused on creating `MultiIndex` instances from `PeriodIndex` instances, indicating that the bug may be related to the handling of `PeriodIndex`.
4. The bug may be related to how the weak reference of `self` is being used within `_engine`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_engine` function is likely due to the usage of `weakref.ref(self)` which creates a weak reference of `self`. When this weak reference is passed to `_engine_type`, it may not be functioning as expected, leading to the failure of the test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is utilized correctly within `_engine_type`. It may require a different approach to handle the weak reference or remove it altogether if it's not necessary.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By directly passing `self` instead of a weak reference to `self`, we simplify the implementation and potentially avoid the issues related to weak references in this context.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods`.
