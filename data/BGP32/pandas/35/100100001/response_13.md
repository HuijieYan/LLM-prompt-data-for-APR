## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self` (an instance of the class where `_engine` is defined).
2. The weak reference created is not being passed correctly to `_engine_type` which results in incorrect behavior when accessing `self` within `_engine_type`.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Passing `period` (a weak reference to `self`) to `_engine_type` is not done properly.
2. Accessing the weak reference `period` within `_engine_type` may result in unexpected behavior.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect passing of the weak reference `period` to `_engine_type`, which leads to unexpected behavior when trying to access the weak reference `period` within `_engine_type`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to pass the weak reference `period` correctly to `_engine_type` and properly handle the weak reference within `_engine_type` to access the desired attributes of the original object.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` with parentheses, we extract the original object from the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`, ensuring that `_engine_type` receives a valid reference to `self`.

This corrected version should fix the bug and ensure that the test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods` passes successfully.
