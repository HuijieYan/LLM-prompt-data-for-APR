### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a cache_readonly function that returns the result of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.
2. The issue lies in the way `weakref.ref(self)` is being used to create a weak reference to `self`.
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is related to creating a `MultiIndex` with `PeriodIndex` objects, indicating that the issue may be with handling weak references correctly.
4. The bug could be related to the weak reference `period` not being properly dereferenced when used in `_engine_type`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by using `weakref.ref(self)` incorrectly. When creating a weak reference in Python, you should call the reference object to get the original object back. However, in the buggy code, the `period` weak reference is not being dereferenced before passing it to `_engine_type`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to dereference the weak reference `period` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This can be done by calling `period()` to obtain the original object reference before using it.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By making this change, the corrected version of the `_engine` function should now properly handle the weak reference and resolve the bug. The corrected version should pass the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods`.
