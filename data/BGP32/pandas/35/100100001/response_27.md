### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a cached property that returns the engine associated with the index.
2. The function is creating a weak reference to `self` and passing it to `_engine_type` along with the length of the index.
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is related to `MultiIndex` and involves checking the monotonicity of levels in the index.

### Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the buggy function lies in the usage of `weakref.ref(self)` as it might not be providing the expected reference.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises due to the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref(self)` in the `_engine` function, which may lead to unexpected behavior in creating the reference to `self`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should create a strong reference to `self` instead of using `weakref.ref(self)`. This will ensure the correct reference to the instance of the class.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version with a strong reference to self
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By making this change, the `_engine` function will create a correct reference to `self` without using a weak reference, which should address the bug and ensure the correct behavior of the function.
