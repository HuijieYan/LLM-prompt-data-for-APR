### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` seems to be attempting to avoid a reference cycle by using `weakref.ref(self)` before passing it to `_engine_type`. However, the issue lies in the fact that `weakref.ref(self)` is being assigned to the variable `period`, but it's not being used to instantiate the `_engine_type`.

### Potential Error Location:
The issue is that the weak reference created with `weakref.ref(self)` is not being dereferenced to access the actual object before passing it to `_engine_type`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by passing the weak reference object `period` instead of the actual object to `_engine_type`, which leads to incorrect behavior when accessing the object.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to dereference the weak reference object `period` before passing it to `_engine_type` in order to access the actual object being referred to.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `period()` is used to dereference the weak reference object before passing it to `_engine_type`. This allows the actual object referenced by `self` to be accessed correctly.
