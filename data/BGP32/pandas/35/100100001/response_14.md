## Analysis:
1. The `_engine` function is a cached readonly function that returns a weak reference to itself by calling `weakref.ref(self)` and then passing the weak reference to `_engine_type`.
2. The test code involves creating a `MultiIndex` from `PeriodIndex` objects, using `Period` objects with specific quarters as input.
3. The test fails due to an assertion error related to the monotonicity of levels in the created `idx2` object.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `_engine` function returning a weak reference of `self` rather than a strong reference. This weak reference causes issues with the creation of `idx2` in the test code because it does not hold onto the reference properly.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `_engine` returns a strong reference instead of a weak reference. By returning a strong reference, the object will be held in memory properly and prevent issues when creating `idx2` in the test function.

## Corrected Version:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By returning `self` directly instead of a weak reference to `self`, the corrected version of the function will maintain a strong reference to the object, preventing the issue observed in the failing test.

The corrected version ensures that the `self` object is properly referenced within the `_engine` function, eliminating the bug that caused the failing test.
