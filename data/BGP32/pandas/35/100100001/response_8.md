## Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `_engine`, which is a cache_readonly method in the `PeriodIndex` class.
2. The function creates a weak reference to the `self` object (in this case, a PeriodIndex instance) and passes it to `_engine_type` to create the engine object.
3. The bug might be due to the way the weak reference is being used or possibly how it interacts with the `_engine_type` function.
4. The failing test is related to checking if the `idx2.levels` are monotonic, which is affected by how `_engine` method works.

## Bug Cause:
The bug might be caused by the incorrect usage or handling of weak references in the `_engine` function. If the weak reference is not properly managed, it could lead to issues with the creation of the engine object.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference handling in the `_engine` function is correct. This involves properly creating and using the weak reference to avoid any reference cycles and memory leaks.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```

By correctly passing the weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`, we ensure that there are no reference cycles or memory leaks. This corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing test.
