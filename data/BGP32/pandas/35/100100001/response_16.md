### Analysis:
1. The `@cache_readonly` decorator is used on the `_engine` method, implying that the method's result will be cached after the first call.
2. The method `_engine` returns a result based on `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, where `period` is a weak reference to `self`.
3. The failing test involves creating a `MultiIndex` from `PeriodIndex` instances and then checking if the level values are monotonic.

### Potential Error Location:
- The usage of `period = weakref.ref(self)` could potentially lead to issues with weak referencing and garbage collection.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug can be caused due to the usage of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` in the `_engine` method. This weak reference may not maintain the reference to the `self` object correctly, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
Instead of using a weak reference, directly pass `self` to the `_engine_type` method in the `_engine` function. This would ensure that `self` is correctly referenced without loss of the object during garbage collection.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By directly passing `self` to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the correct reference to `self` is maintained without relying on weak references that might cause issues. This correction should resolve the bug and make the failing test pass.
