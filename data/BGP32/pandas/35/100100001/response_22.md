## Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to the `self` object (which is an instance of the class the function is defined in). However, the weak reference is not being properly passed to the `_engine_type` constructor. This can lead to potential reference cycle issues.

## Identified Issue:
The issue lies in the way the weak reference is being passed to the `_engine_type` constructor. The `weakref.ref(self)` line should actually be storing the weak reference as `period()` instead of just `period`. Additionally, the weak reference should be dereferenced using `()` before passing it to the `_engine_type` constructor.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the weak reference `period` is not properly dereferenced before being passed to the `_engine_type` constructor. This can cause incorrect behavior and potential reference cycle issues.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to store the weak reference as `period()` and dereference it before passing it to the `_engine_type` constructor.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By making this correction, the issue with potential reference cycles and incorrect behavior should be resolved.
