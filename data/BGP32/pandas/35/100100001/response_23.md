## Analysis:
1. The `_engine` function uses `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference of itself before passing it to `_engine_type()`.
2. The test function triggers the creation of a `MultiIndex` object with `PeriodIndex` elements.
3. The test function asserts that all levels of the resulting `MultiIndex` object are monotonic.

## Bug:
The bug is in the `_engine` function where a weak reference is created using `weakref.ref(self)` which may lead to a reference cycle issue, potentially causing unexpected behavior or memory leaks.

## Fix:
To fix the bug, we should remove the creation of the weak reference and pass `self` directly to `_engine_type()`. This should prevent any reference cycle issues and ensure proper functionality.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
``` 

By making this change, the corrected version of the `_engine` function should no longer create a weak reference and pass `self` directly to `_engine_type()`, resolving the bug and ensuring the test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` passes successfully.
