### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self` (presumably the instance of the class). The weak reference is intended to avoid reference cycles.
2. The function then attempts to instantiate `_engine_type` with the weak reference and the length of `self`.
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is related to `PeriodIndex` and `MultiIndex`, and it may be encountering issues due to the buggy behavior of the `_engine` function.

### Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the buggy function lies in the use of `weakref.ref(self)` and how it is being passed to `_engine_type`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug may be caused by the weak reference created using `weakref.ref(self)` not being used correctly in the instantiation of `_engine_type`. This may lead to unexpected behavior in the `PeriodIndex` operations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Instead of passing just the weak reference to `_engine_type`, we should extract the actual `self` object from the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`. This ensures that the correct `self` object is used for the instantiation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Extract the actual object from the weak reference
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using the corrected version of the function, we ensure that the `self` object is correctly passed to `_engine_type`, potentially resolving the issues with the failing test.
