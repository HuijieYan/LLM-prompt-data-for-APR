## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` uses `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object and then passes it to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`.
2. The use of `weakref.ref(self)` might not be correct in this context and could lead to unexpected behavior.
3. The failing test is related to the `PeriodIndex` class and its usage, indicating a problem with the `PeriodIndex._engine` function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to determine the correct way to instantiate the `_engine_type` class without any potential issues related to reference cycles.

## Fix:
```python
# Fixing the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By directly passing `self` to `_engine_type` instead of creating a weak reference to it, we eliminate the potential issue with weak references and ensure that the correct object reference is passed to `_engine_type`.

This fix should address the bug and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
