### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` uses a `cache_readonly` decorator, indicating that the function should only be called once and its result cached for subsequent calls.
2. The function creates a weak reference to the `self` object (presumably an instance of a class) and passes it to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`.
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` involves creating a `MultiIndex` and calling the `_get_level_values` method on it.
4. The failing test uses `Period` and `PeriodIndex` from the `pandas` library.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_engine` function lies in the line `period = weakref.ref(self)`. The `weakref.ref` function creates a weak reference to the object `self` without keeping it alive. This means that when `_engine_type` is called with `period`, it may not be a valid reference to `self` leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we should ensure that a strong reference to `self` is maintained while passing it to `_engine_type`. One way to achieve this is by using a bound method instead of a weak reference.

### Corrected Version of the `_engine` Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By directly passing `self` to `_engine_type` instead of creating a weak reference, we ensure that a valid reference to the object is used, fixing the bug.
