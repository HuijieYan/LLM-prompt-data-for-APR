## Analysis:
- The buggy function `_engine` is a `@cache_readonly` method in the `PeriodIndex` class located in the file `pandas/core/indexes/period.py`.
- The function uses `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self` (an instance of `PeriodIndex`) and passes it to `_engine_type` along with the length of the `PeriodIndex`.
- The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is checking whether the level values of a `MultiIndex` created from `PeriodIndex` objects are monotonic.

## Bug:
The bug in the `_engine` function is that it incorrectly creates a weak reference to `self` using `weakref.ref`. Instead of preserving a weak reference to the actual instance, it creates a weak reference to a bound method (i.e., the function object itself) due to missing parentheses after `weakref.ref(self)`.

This leads to incorrect behavior when `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` is called later in the function because it expects an instance of `PeriodIndex` instead of a bound method.

## Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the weak reference creation by adding parentheses after `weakref.ref(self)` to obtain a weak reference to the actual `self` instance. This will ensure that the correct instance of `PeriodIndex` is passed to `_engine_type`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Corrected weak reference creation with parentheses
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By making this change, we ensure that the correct instance of `PeriodIndex` is passed to `_engine_type`, fixing the bug and allowing the failing test to pass successfully.
