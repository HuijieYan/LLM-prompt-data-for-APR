### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a cache_readonly decorator that aims to avoid reference cycles by passing a weak reference of 'self' to `_engine_type`.
2. The potential error location is in the line `period = weakref.ref(self)`, where the weak reference may not be correctly applied.
3. The bug causes the test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` to fail because the weak reference handling in `_engine` is not implemented properly, leading to unexpected behavior in the test.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to 'self' is correctly passed to `_engine_type` without causing any reference cycles or unexpected behavior.


### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Address the weak reference handling in `_engine` to correctly pass a weak reference of 'self' to `_engine_type`.
2. Ensure that the weak reference does not cause any reference cycles or unexpected behavior.
3. Test the corrected function with the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` to verify the fix.


### Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, we ensure that a weak reference to 'self' is correctly passed to `_engine_type` without causing any reference cycles. This should fix the bug and allow the function to work as expected with the provided test.
