## Analysis:
1. The `_engine` function is decorated with `@cache_readonly`, indicating that it is intended to be memoized and only computed once.
2. The `_engine` function uses `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`.
3. The test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` with Period objects.
4. The test then creates a new `MultiIndex` by getting level values from the original `MultiIndex`.

## Identified Issue:
1. The issue seems to be with the use of `weakref.ref(self)` in the `_engine` function, where a weak reference to `self` is being passed to `_engine_type`. This weak reference approach might not be preserving the reference correctly for computations in `_engine_type`.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Instead of using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference, directly use `self` in `_engine` function.
2. Ensure that the `_engine` function is correctly memoized with the `@cache_readonly` decorator.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# the corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
