## Analysis:
- The buggy function `_engine` is a cached read-only function that returns the engine type for handling Period objects in pandas.
- The bug seems to be related to creating a weak reference to self and passing it to the `_engine_type` function.
- The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is related to `PeriodIndex` and checking if the level values are monotonic.

## Bug Cause:
- The bug in the `_engine` function lies in creating a weak reference `period` to `self` (an instance of the class) and passing it to `_engine_type` method. This might lead to a reference cycle issue or improper handling of the weak reference.
- The bug causes the `_engine` function to not function properly, which may lead to failures in operations involving Period objects like in the failing test.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Instead of creating a weak reference to `self`, it would be more appropriate to directly pass `self` to the `_engine_type` method.
- This approach would ensure that the correct reference to the instance is passed without any issues related to weak referencing.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By making this change, we ensure that the instance `self` is directly passed to the `_engine_type` method without creating a weak reference. This should fix the bug and ensure proper functionality of the `_engine` method.
