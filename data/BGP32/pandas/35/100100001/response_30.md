### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a cacheable read-only method that returns the engine type for the PeriodIndex.
2. The function uses `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object, which is then passed to `_engine_type` along with the length of the PeriodIndex.
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is checking if the levels extracted from the MultiIndex are monotonic.
4. The bug may be related to the way the weak reference of `self` is being passed to `_engine_type`.

### Error Location:
The error could potentially be in the way the weak reference `period` is created using `weakref.ref(self)` and then passed to `_engine_type`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug might be caused by the misuse or incorrect handling of weak references in the `_engine` function. This misuse could lead to unexpected behavior or errors when trying to access or use the weak reference.

### Fixing Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is correctly created and passed to `_engine_type`. This may involve revising the way weak references are used in the function to avoid any potential issues with the garbage collection of objects.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

In the corrected version, `period` is dereferenced by calling `period()` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This ensures that the actual object referenced by the weak reference is used in `_engine_type`. This change should address the potential issue with weak references in the original buggy function.
