## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` function that returns the engine type for a `PeriodIndex` object.
2. It uses `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to the `self` object (the `PeriodIndex`) to avoid reference cycles.
3. The function then calls `self._engine_type`, passing the weak reference and the length of the `PeriodIndex`.

## Identified Issue:
The issue in the provided `_engine` function is that it is creating a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object `self`, but it is not extracting the actual object from the weak reference when passing it as an argument to `self._engine_type`. This results in passing a weak reference object instead of the `PeriodIndex` object itself.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because `self._engine_type` expects a `PeriodIndex` object but receives a weak reference object instead. This mismatch in the argument type causes the test to fail.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to extract the actual object from the weak reference before passing it to `self._engine_type`. This can be done by calling the weak reference object with `()` to get the referenced object.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By incorporating the corrected version of the `_engine` function provided above, the bug should be fixed, and the failing test should pass successfully.
