### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a decorator function with a caching mechanism using `@cache_readonly`.
2. It takes `self` (presumably an instance of a class) as an argument and returns the result of calling `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.
3. The function tries to avoid reference cycles by creating a weak reference to `self`.
4. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` involves creating a `MultiIndex` and checking if the levels are monotonic.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_engine` function lies in the line `period = weakref.ref(self)`. The weak reference should be stored in a variable outside the function scope to maintain the reference. Due to this, the weak reference `period` gets garbage collected after the function call, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Store the weak reference to `self` outside the `_engine` function to prevent it from being garbage collected.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the _engine function
_period = weakref.ref(self)  # Store the weak reference outside the function

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(_period, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference `_period` outside the `_engine` function, the corrected version ensures that the weak reference remains valid throughout the program execution, fixing the bug.
