The bug in the `_engine` function occurs because `weakref.ref(self)` creates a weak reference to the `self` object instead of passing the `self` object itself to the `_engine_type` function. This leads to issues with the reference and results in a failing test.

To fix this bug, we need to pass the actual `self` object to the `_engine_type` function instead of a weak reference.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
# The corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By passing `self` directly to the `_engine_type` function, we avoid the weak reference issue and ensure that the function works correctly.

After applying this fix, the failing test should pass successfully.
