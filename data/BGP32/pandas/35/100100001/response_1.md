The buggy function `_engine` in the file `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` is causing the test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` in the file `pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py` to fail. The issue lies in the use of `weakref.ref(self)` within the `_engine` function.

The cause of the bug is that `weakref.ref(self)` creates a weak reference to the `self` object, which means that the object referenced can be garbage collected if there are no strong references to it. This leads to the `_engine_type` function receiving a weak reference instead of the actual object, causing unexpected behavior in the `_engine_type` function.

To fix this bug, you should modify the `_engine` function to return a strong reference to the `self` object instead of a weak reference.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By returning `self` directly instead of a weak reference, the `_engine_type` function will receive the actual object and not a weak reference, thus resolving the bug and allowing the test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` to pass successfully.
