First, let's analyze the buggy function `_engine(self)` in the file `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` and its relationship with the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` in the file `pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py`.

1. The `_engine(self)` function is a cache_readonly function that returns an engine type based on a weak reference to the `self` object passed to it. In the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods`, there is a reference to `idx._get_level_values(level)` which is related to the engine type.

2. The potential error location within the buggy function could be how the weak reference `period` is used in `_engine_type(period, len(self))`.

3. The cause of the bug could be related to how the weak reference `period` is interacted with in `_engine_type(period, len(self))`. This interaction might lead to incorrect behavior or a failure in the expected engine type creation.

4. To fix the bug, we can try storing the weak reference `period` as a strong reference temporarily before passing it to `_engine_type`. This can ensure that the correct object is being passed to `_engine_type`.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `_engine(self)` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    period = period_ref()  # Retrieve the object from the weak reference
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `period = period_ref()`, we extract the object from the weak reference to pass it to `_engine_type`. This corrected version should address the potential issue with the weak reference usage and ensure that the correct object is passed to `_engine_type`.
