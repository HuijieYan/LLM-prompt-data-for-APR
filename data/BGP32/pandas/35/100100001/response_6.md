## Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, but it is not passing the weak reference to `_engine_type` correctly. This can lead to a reference cycle issue and cause unexpected behavior.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Creating a weak reference to `self` incorrectly using `weakref.ref(self)` can cause issues.
2. Passing the weak reference to `_engine_type` might not be done correctly.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `_engine` function is that it is not passing the weak reference correctly to `_engine_type`, leading to potential reference cycle problems.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly pass the weak reference to `_engine_type` to avoid any reference cycle issues. We should ensure that the weak reference is being utilized properly in the function.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By making the correction as shown above, the weak reference `period()` is used instead of just `period` when calling `_engine_type`. This ensures that the correct object is referenced and should fix the issue.
