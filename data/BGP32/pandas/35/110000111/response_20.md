### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `@cache_readonly` decorator function within the `PeriodIndex` class.
2. The function creates a weak reference to `self` but does not handle it correctly, leading to potential issues with the `_engine_type` used to construct the engine.
3. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` leads to weak references being lost, resulting in errors.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained throughout the function's execution.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to the incorrect handling of weak references within the `_engine` function. The weak reference `period` is created within the function but not used properly in initializing the `_engine_type`. This leads to potential issues with garbage collection and weak reference dropping, as noted in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use the weak reference `period` throughout the function to ensure it is not dropped prematurely.
2. Pass the weak reference to `_engine_type` correctly to maintain the reference to `self`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self), **self._get_attributes_dict())
```

### Explanation:
In the corrected version of the function, we use the weak reference `period` to create a weak reference to `self`. We then pass this weak reference along with the length of the PeriodIndex and any additional attributes using `_get_attributes_dict()` to initialize the `_engine_type`. This ensures that the weak reference to `self` is maintained throughout the operation, resolving the issue of weak reference dropping and potential errors.
