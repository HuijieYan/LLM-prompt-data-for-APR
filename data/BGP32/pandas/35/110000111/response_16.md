The bug in the `_engine` function is caused by the fact that it uses a weak reference to self in combination with a normal reference assignment to `period`. This leads to the weak reference losing its reference to `self` prematurely, resulting in `self` being None when `_engine_type` is called.

To fix this issue, we need to properly create a weak reference to `self` and use it when calling `_engine_type`. We can achieve this by modifying the `_engine` function as follows:

```python
import weakref

# Fixing the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self to avoid reference cycle
    weak_self = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weak_self, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, we ensure that reference cycle issues are avoided and the weak reference still points to the correct object when passed to `_engine_type`.

This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the weak reference is maintained properly.
