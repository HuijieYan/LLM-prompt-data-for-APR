### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class uses `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object (which is an instance of `PeriodIndex`).
2. The `_engine` function then attempts to create an instance of the `_engine_type` class by passing the weak reference `period` and the length of the current `PeriodIndex`.

### Potential Error Location:
The bug seems to be with the weak referencing implementation or management, leading to the weak reference being dropped unexpectedly.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug causes the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object to be dropped prematurely, resulting in the `_engine_type` receiving `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex` object. This behavior contradicts the intention of using weak referencing to prevent reference cycles.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, ensure that the weak reference to the `self` object is maintained until its intended usage within the `_engine_type` class. This may involve modifying the weak reference creation or usage logic to appropriately retain the reference.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

This corrected version ensures that the weak reference is correctly utilized by calling `period()` to retrieve the referenced `self` object when creating an instance of `_engine_type`.
