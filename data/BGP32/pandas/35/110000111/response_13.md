## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object (which is an instance of `PeriodIndex`). The weak reference is then passed to `_engine_type` to avoid a reference cycle. However, the issue arises because the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object is being assigned to the variable `period`, but it is not being used in the subsequent return statement. Instead, the function returns the `PeriodIndex` object itself.

This causes a problem when attempting to ensure that weak references are maintained, leading to the issue described on GitHub where weak references are lost in certain scenarios involving copying `PeriodIndex` levels in a `MultiIndex`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference created using `weakref.ref(self)` is actually used in creating the `PeriodEngine`. By utilizing the weak reference properly, we can maintain the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object and prevent the loss of weak references in scenarios like the one described in the GitHub issue.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# Updated _engine function in the PeriodIndex class
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    # Use the weak reference when creating the PeriodEngine
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

By incorporating the weak reference `period_ref` in the `return` statement, we ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives a valid weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance, addressing the issue described on GitHub.
