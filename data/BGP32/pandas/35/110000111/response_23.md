### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is responsible for returning an instance of `_engine_type` by passing a weak reference of `self` to it. This is crucial to avoid reference cycles.
2. The provided function has an issue where `weakref.ref(self)` is assigned to `period` but not utilized effectively in passing it to `_engine_type`.
3. The bug causes the weak reference `period` to become unreachable, leading to the `_engine_type` receiving None instead of a valid weak reference.
4. To fix the bug, the weak reference `period` needs to be correctly passed to `_engine_type`.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)  # Create a weak reference to self

    # Pass the weak reference to _engine_type
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this fix, the weak reference to `self` is correctly utilized while calling `_engine_type`, ensuring that the weak reference remains valid.
