### Analyzing the buggy function:
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is defined as a `@cache_readonly`, which implies that the result of the function will be cached after the first call. The function takes `self` as a parameter and returns an instance of `_engine_type` using a weak reference of `self`.

### Potential error locations:
The potential error in the buggy function could be related to the weak reference usage or the instantiation of `_engine_type` with `period` and `len(self)`.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug may arise due to the weak reference usage where the reference to `self` (PeriodIndex instance) is not maintained properly, leading to `_engine_type` receiving `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex` instance.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the weak reference mechanism should be revised to ensure the correct reference to `self` is passed to `_engine_type`. The weak reference should be used properly to maintain the reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `period` in `weakref.ref(self)` is replaced with `period_ref` to properly store the weak reference to `self`, which then provides the correct reference to `_engine_type`. This correction ensures that the weak reference is handled properly within the `_engine` function.
