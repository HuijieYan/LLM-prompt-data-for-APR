## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object. The intention is to pass this weak reference to `_engine_type` to avoid a reference cycle. However, the problem lies in how the `WeakMethod` reference is stored and accessed. 

The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when copying levels of a `MultiIndex`, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is lost, leading to `None` being passed to `PeriodEngine`.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by storing the weak reference to `PeriodIndex` in a variable rather than passing it directly to `_engine_type`. As a result, when copying levels of a `MultiIndex`, the weak reference is lost, and `None` is passed to `PeriodEngine`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should directly pass the weak reference to `self` to `_engine_type` instead of storing it in a variable. This way, the weak reference will not be lost when copying levels of a `MultiIndex`.

## Corrected Function
```python
    def _engine(self):
        return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
``` 

This correction ensures that the weak reference to `PeriodIndex` is passed directly to `_engine_type` without being stored in a variable, preventing it from being lost when copying levels of a `MultiIndex`.
