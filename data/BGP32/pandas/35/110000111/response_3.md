### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference of the current `PeriodIndex` instance. It then passes this weak reference to `_engine_type` to create an instance of the engine.
2. The issue seems to be related to the weak reference being deleted prematurely, causing the engine to receive `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.
3. The bug is likely causing the engine to fail or behave incorrectly, leading to unexpected errors.
4. To fix the bug, we should ensure that the weak reference is maintained until it is no longer needed by the engine.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the weak reference `period` being assigned within the `_engine` function and not being held by any other variable or data structure. This can lead to the weak reference being garbage collected before it is used by `_engine_type`, resulting in `None` being passed to the engine.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we can store the weak reference `period` as an instance variable within the `PeriodIndex` class to ensure it stays alive until it is used by the engine.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference as an instance variable
    self._weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._weak_period, len(self))
``` 

By storing the weak reference as an instance variable `self._weak_period`, we ensure that the reference will not be garbage collected prematurely. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and prevent any unexpected errors related to the engine initialization.
