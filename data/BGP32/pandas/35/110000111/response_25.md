## Analysis:
1. **Issue:**
   The bug is present in the `_engine` method within the `PeriodIndex` class of the `pandas` library.
   
2. **Error Locations:**
   The error occurs in the `_engine` method due to the weak reference creation causing a reference cycle problem.

3. **Cause of the Bug:**
   - The buggy function `_engine` tries to create a weak reference to `self`, which is the `PeriodIndex` object.
   - However, due to the way the weak reference is created, it leads to a reference cycle issue where the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` gets dropped before intended.
   - This results in the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`, causing the error mentioned in the GitHub issue.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**
   To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference creation is handled correctly to prevent the premature dropping of the `PeriodIndex` object.

5. **Corrected Version of the Function**:
```python
# Corrected version of the _engine function
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference without the cyclic reference issue
    weak_self = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weak_self, len(self._data))
```

By creating a weak reference to `self` directly without any cyclic reference issues, the corrected version of the function can avoid the bug mentioned in the GitHub issue.
