The bug in the provided function `_engine` is due to the weak reference `period` not being correctly passed to `_engine_type`. This leads to the PeriodEngine receiving `None` instead of the intended PeriodIndex.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is used properly in creating the PeriodIndex object for `_engine_type`. We should also handle the weak reference properly to avoid reference cycles.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```

In this corrected version, we are correctly passing the weak reference `period` to `_engine_type` along with the length of the values in `self._values`. This should ensure that the PeriodEngine receives the correct reference to the PeriodIndex object.

By implementing this fix, the function should now correctly create the PeriodIndex object for `_engine_type` without losing the weak reference. This correction should resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
