### Analysis
The `buggy` function is a method within the `PeriodIndex` class, which is used to create an engine type based on the length of the `PeriodIndex` object. The `buggy` function uses a weak reference to avoid reference cycles. The `buggy` function returns the engine type based on the period and length of the `PeriodIndex` object.

The issue reported on GitHub indicates that copying `PeriodIndex` levels on a `MultiIndex` may lose weak references, causing an error when checking if the levels are monotonic. This is due to the weak reference of the `PeriodIndex` being dropped prematurely.

### Error location
The issue lies in the `buggy` function where the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object should be maintained throughout the creation of the engine type.

### Bug cause
The bug is caused by the premature dropping of the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object. This causes the `engine_type` function to receive `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

### Fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained until the `engine_type` function is created. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference in a variable that persists throughout the function's execution.

### Code Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `buggy` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

This fix ensures that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained throughout the function's execution, preventing premature dropping and resolving the reported issue on GitHub.

By implementing this fix, the `buggy` function should now operate correctly and maintain weak references as intended, resolving the reported bug.
