## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using weak references to prevent reference cycles and memory leaks. The function is returning an instance of `_engine_type` with a weak reference to `self` as an argument.
2. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` instances are being dropped prematurely, leading to unexpected behavior when accessing the levels of a `MultiIndex`.
3. The bug likely occurs because the weak reference `period` is not being properly stored or handled within the `_engine` function, causing it to be lost before it can be used.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is correctly stored and accessed within the `_engine` function, preventing it from being dropped prematurely.

## Bug Fix
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _engine(self):
    # Store a weak reference of self in a variable to prevent premature dropping
    self_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self_weakref, len(self))
``` 

By storing the weak reference `self_weakref` within the function and then passing it to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the weak reference is not dropped prematurely and can be used as intended. This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and prevent the unexpected behavior when accessing levels of a `MultiIndex` containing weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` instances.
