## Strategy for fixing the bug
The bug seems to be related to the weak reference handling within the `_engine` function. The weak reference is created with `period = weakref.ref(self)` but it is not correctly utilized when creating the `_engine_type` instance. To fix the bug, the weak reference `period` needs to be dereferenced properly before passing it to `_engine_type`.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    period = weak_period()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By dereferencing the weak reference with `period = weak_period()`, the issue related to the weak reference handling should be resolved. This corrected version ensures that the `period` variable contains a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance before passing it to `_engine_type`.
