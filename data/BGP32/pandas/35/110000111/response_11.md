## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` function used to create an engine type with a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object.
2. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` objects are dropped before the intended time, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.
3. The `PeriodIndex` class and `PeriodArray` class are related to handling regular periods in time.
4. The bug is likely occurring due to how the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is being handled within the `_engine` function.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Adjust the handling of the weak reference to ensure it is maintained until it is no longer needed.
2. Make sure the weak reference to `self` is correctly passed to the `_engine_type` function to avoid losing the reference prematurely.

## Bug Fix - Corrected Version
```python
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, the weak reference to `self` is maintained throughout the function, ensuring that it is passed correctly to the `_engine_type` function. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and prevent the premature dropping of weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` objects.
