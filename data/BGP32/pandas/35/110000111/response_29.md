## Analyzing the buggy function and issue

The buggy function is `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class. The function is using a `weakref` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance, and then it's trying to create an instance of `_engine_type` with the weak reference and the length of `self`.

The issue reported on GitHub indicates that copying `PeriodIndex` levels on a `MultiIndex` can result in losing weak references, causing errors when checking for monotonicity. This suggests that the weak reference created in the `_engine` function is not being maintained properly during certain operations involving `PeriodIndex`.

## Identifying potential error locations

1. The weak reference created in `_engine` might not be maintained properly during certain operations involving `PeriodIndex`.
2. There could be issues with the reference cycle and how the weak reference is being stored within the `_engine` function.

## Explanation of the bug

The bug seems to be related to the weak reference `period` created in the `_engine` function not being preserved correctly during operations that involve copying or reshaping the `PeriodIndex`. This results in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`, leading to errors down the line.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference created in the `_engine` function remains valid and is not lost during operations that involve copying or reshaping the `PeriodIndex`. This might involve modifying how the weak reference is stored or updating its behavior to handle such cases correctly.

## Corrected version of the `_engine` function

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a strong reference to self
    period = self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

In this corrected version, we are creating a strong reference `period` to `self` instead of using a weak reference. This ensures that the `PeriodIndex` instance is correctly passed to the `_engine_type` without the risk of losing the reference during certain operations.
