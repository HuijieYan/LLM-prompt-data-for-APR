### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using a `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self` object.
- The function is then returning the result of calling `_engine_type` with the weak reference and the length of `self`.
- The issue mentioned on GitHub indicates that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before intended, leading to `None` being passed to the `PeriodEngine`.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the weak reference to `self` is being created locally in the `_engine` function and is not retained after the function exits. This causes the weak reference to become `None` when attempting to use it in `_engine_type`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to create a class-level attribute to store the weak reference to `self` so that it persists beyond the `_engine` function call.
- This way, the weak reference will remain valid when used in `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
# The corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    if not hasattr(self, '_weakref'):
        self._weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._weakref, len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference to `self` is stored as a class attribute (`_weakref`) and reused when needed in the `_engine` function. This ensures that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object is not dropped prematurely.
