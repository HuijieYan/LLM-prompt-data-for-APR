### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is creating a weak reference to `self` and then passing it to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`.
2. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` results in losing weak references, which causes unintended behavior.
3. The bug is likely due to the use of `weakref.ref(self)` creating a weak reference that is not maintained properly when the `PeriodIndex` object is copied to another object.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference remains intact even when the `PeriodIndex` object is copied or referenced elsewhere.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Instead of creating a weak reference to `self` directly in the `_engine` function, we can encapsulate the weak reference mechanism within the `PeriodEngine`.
2. Modify the `PeriodEngine` class to handle the weak reference internally and maintain it correctly.
3. Ensure that weak references to `PeriodIndex` objects are maintained properly during operations like copying to `MultiIndex`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class PeriodEngine:
    def __init__(self, period_index, length):
        self.period_index = weakref.ref(period_index)
        self.length = length

class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        return PeriodEngine(self, len(self))
```

By encapsulating the weak reference mechanism within the `PeriodEngine` class, we ensure that weak references to `PeriodIndex` objects are handled correctly. This should resolve the reported bug related to losing weak references when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`.
