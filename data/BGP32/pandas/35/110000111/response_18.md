## Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function & Class Relationship**: The function `_engine` is an attribute of the `PeriodIndex` class. It is responsible for creating an instance of `_engine_type` using a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance.
   
2. **Error Location**: The issue is likely in the weak reference usage, where the weak reference to `self` is obtained but not appropriately handled when passing to `_engine_type`.

3. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - The bug leads to an issue where a weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` instance is dropped prematurely, resulting in `_engine_type` receiving `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.
   - This behavior leads to incorrect processing within `_engine_type`, likely causing the bug described in the GitHub issue.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**:
   - Ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained throughout the `_engine` function's scope and when passed to `_engine_type`.
   - Avoid premature dropping of the weak reference to prevent passing `None` to `_engine_type`.
   
5. **Corrected Version**:
```python
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version above, `period()` is used to retrieve the `PeriodIndex` object from the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`. This ensures that the weak reference is not dropped prematurely, resolving the issue.
