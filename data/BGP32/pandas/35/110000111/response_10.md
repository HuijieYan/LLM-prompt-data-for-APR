### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is expected to return an instance of `self._engine_type`. However, it is creating a weak reference to `self` and passing it to `_engine_type`, leading to potential reference cycle issues.
   
### Error Locations:
1. Creating a weak reference to `self` using `weakref.ref(self)`.
2. Passing the weak reference `period` to `_engine_type`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by creating a weak reference to `self` and passing it to `_engine_type`, which leads to potential reference cycle problems. This issue can cause unexpected behavior when accessing attributes of the `PeriodIndex` instance.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to pass `self` directly to `_engine_type` instead of creating a weak reference. This will ensure that there are no reference cycle problems and the intended `PeriodIndex` instance is passed to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
``` 

By directly passing `self` to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the `PeriodIndex` instance is correctly passed without introducing potential reference cycle issues.
