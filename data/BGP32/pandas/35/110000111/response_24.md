The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is creating a weak reference to `self` to avoid a reference cycle, but it is not being handled correctly. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when copying `PeriodIndex` levels in a `MultiIndex`, weak references get lost, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to handle the weak reference properly, ensuring that the `PeriodIndex` object remains available for the `PeriodEngine`. The corrected version should maintain the weak reference without losing it prematurely.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# Corrected `_engine` function
def _engine(self):
    def weakref_proxy(cls_self):
        return cls_self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(cls_self), len(cls_self))

    return cache_readonly(weakref_proxy, name="_engine")(self)
```

This fixed version handles the weak reference by creating a proxy using `weakref.proxy` to keep a reference to `self` without causing a reference cycle. The corrected function should now maintain the integrity of weak references for `PeriodIndex` objects even in scenarios where levels are copied within a `MultiIndex`.
