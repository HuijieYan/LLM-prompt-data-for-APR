## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is defined within the `PeriodIndex` class and it takes `self` as a parameter. It returns an instance of `_engine_type` by passing a weak reference of `self` and the length of `self` as arguments.
2. The issue mentioned on GitHub indicates that weak references are lost when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`, resulting in an error due to `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of a `PeriodIndex` object.
3. The bug is likely due to the way weak references are handled in the `_engine` function, leading to the loss of the weak reference when copying.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is maintained even when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`.
5. We can modify the `_engine` function to create a weak reference to `self` and pass it to `_engine_type` when needed.

## Fixing the Bug:
```python
import weakref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    # Pass the weak reference to _engine_type
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

By creating a weak reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the weak reference is maintained even when `PeriodIndex` levels are copied, resolving the issue mentioned on GitHub.
