### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, expecting that it will prevent a reference cycle. However, the use of `weakref.ref(self)` does not return the actual object but a weak reference proxy.
2. The issue described on GitHub highlights that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped unintentionally, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.
3. The bug occurs because the weak reference created by `weakref.ref(self)` does not serve the intended purpose in this context, leading to a loss of reference to `self`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is maintained correctly and does not drop the reference prematurely. Instead of using `weakref.ref(self)`, we can directly pass `self` to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    def _engine(self):
        return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
``` 

With this correction, the `PeriodIndex` object itself will be passed to `_engine_type`, ensuring that the reference is not lost prematurely.
