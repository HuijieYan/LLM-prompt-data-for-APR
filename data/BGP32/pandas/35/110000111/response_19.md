### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is supposed to create an instance of `_engine_type` using a weak reference of `self` as the `period` argument.
2. The function `weakref.ref(self)` creates a weak reference to `self` but does not maintain a strong reference to the object, which can lead to the weak reference becoming invalid when the object is garbage collected.
3. The issue on GitHub indicates that when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`, the weak references are lost because the `PeriodEngine` receives `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`, causing errors.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until it is used in the `_engine_type`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the premature garbage collection of the weak reference to `self` in the `_engine` function, leading to `None` being passed to the `PeriodEngine`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should store the weak reference to `self` as an instance variable of the `PeriodIndex` class to ensure its availability when needed in the `_engine` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    """
    Immutable ndarray holding ordinal values indicating regular periods in time.
    Index keys are boxed to Period objects which carries the metadata (eg,
    frequency information).
    ...
    """

    def __init__(self, data=None, copy=False, freq=None, year=None, month=None, 
                 quarter=None, day=None, hour=None, minute=None, second=None, tz=None, dtype=None):
        # Initialize the weak reference to self
        self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
        super().__init__(data=data, copy=copy, freq=freq, year=year, month=month, 
                         quarter=quarter, day=day, hour=hour, minute=minute, second=second, tz=tz, dtype=dtype)

    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Retrieve the weak reference to self
        period = self._period_ref
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference to `self` (`PeriodIndex`) during initialization in the `_period_ref` instance variable and then using it in the `_engine` function, we ensure that the weak reference remains valid until it is used by the `PeriodEngine`. This approach fixes the bug as described in the GitHub issue.
