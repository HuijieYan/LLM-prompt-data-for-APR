### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` aims to return an instance of `_engine_type` by passing a weak reference of `self` to it. However, the implementation is incorrect, leading to the weak reference not being maintained properly, causing issues as reported in the GitHub bug.

### Error Location:
The issue lies in how the weak reference is being constructed and assigned to the variable `period`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises due to the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref(self)` which does not maintain a reference to `self` as intended.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the weak reference should be stored correctly to avoid its premature disposal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def _engine(self):
        # Correct implementation to properly maintain weak reference
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

After applying this fix, the weak reference `period` will correctly reference `self`, ensuring that the intended weak reference cycle is maintained.
