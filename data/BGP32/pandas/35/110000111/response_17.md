## Analyze the buggy function

The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` method within the `PeriodIndex` class. It is intended to create an instance of the `_engine_type` class with a weak reference to the `self` object. The `_engine_type` constructor takes two arguments: a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object and the length of the `self` object.

The problem arises from the fact that a weak reference to `self` is created but not properly passed to the `_engine_type` constructor. This leads to the `_engine_type` receiving a `None` object instead of the intended `self` object.

## Identify potential error locations
1. The weak reference `period` is created but not used correctly when calling `_engine_type`.
2. There is a missing argument when calling `_engine_type`.

## Explain the cause of the bug
The bug is caused by creating a weak reference to `self` but not passing it properly to the `_engine_type` constructor. As a result, the `_engine_type` receives a `None` object instead of the actual `self` object. This leads to unexpected behavior and errors in the system.

## Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to correctly pass the weak reference to `self` when calling the `_engine_type` constructor. This involves ensuring that the weak reference is properly dereferenced before being passed as an argument.

## Bug-fix implementation
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a dereferenced weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, the weak reference `period` is dereferenced by calling `period()` before passing it to the `_engine_type` constructor. This ensures that the actual `self` object is passed to the constructor instead of a `None` object. This fix should resolve the issue with weak references in the `PeriodIndex` class.
