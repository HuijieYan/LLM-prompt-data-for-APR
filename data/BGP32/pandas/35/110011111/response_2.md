Based on the analysis of the provided function, error message, runtime input/output values, expected input/output values, and the GitHub issue, it seems that the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is not correctly handling the weak reference to the `self` object. The `NoneType` error indicates that the weak reference is not working as intended, causing a problem when accessing attributes of the weakly referenced object.

To fix the bug, you need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained correctly. Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if period() is not None else None
```

In this corrected version, we explicitly check if the weakly referenced `self` object is not `None` before using it to create the `_engine_type`. This check ensures that the weak reference is still valid and prevents the `NoneType` error that was occurring.

By implementing this fix, the function should now properly handle the weak reference to the `self` object and prevent the error from occurring. It should pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output values provided.
