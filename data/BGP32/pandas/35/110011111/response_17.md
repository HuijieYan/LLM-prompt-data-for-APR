To fix the bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is maintained correctly and not dropped prematurely. The `PeriodEngine` is expecting a valid reference to the PeriodIndex object, but it receives a `None` object instead in certain scenarios, leading to attribute errors.

To resolve this issue, we should modify the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class as follows:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    class PeriodEngine(IndexEngine):
        def __init__(self, data, *, index, dtype, copy):
            self.period = period()  # Retrieve the weak reference and create a strong reference
            
            super().__init__(data, index=index, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)

    return PeriodEngine(self._values, index=self, dtype=self._dtype, copy=False)
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that `period()` retrieves the underlying object from the weak reference, creating a strong reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance. This approach prevents the premature deletion of the object and ensures that the `PeriodEngine` functions correctly with the valid object reference.

By making this adjustment, the `PeriodEngine` will have access to the correct `PeriodIndex` instance throughout its operation, resolving the attribute errors seen in the failing test case.

This fix addresses the issue raised in the GitHub report and ensures the expected behavior of the `PeriodIndex` class and its associated `PeriodEngine`.
