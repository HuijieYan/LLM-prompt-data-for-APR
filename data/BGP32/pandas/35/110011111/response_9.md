## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_engine` is meant to return an instance of `_engine_type` class with a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object. However, the weak reference implementation seems to be incorrect.
2. The error message indicates an AttributeError `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, which suggests that the `view` method is being called on a `NoneType` object.
3. The failing test involves constructing a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` and checking if the resulting levels are monotonic. The error occurs during this check due to the incorrect weak reference handling in the `_engine` function.
4. To fix the bug, the implementation of the weak reference in the `_engine` function needs to be corrected to ensure that the weak reference to `self` (`PeriodIndex`) is maintained correctly.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the weak reference implementation in the `_engine` function should be adjusted to ensure that the reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained properly. This can involve creating a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object and using it when constructing the `_engine_type` instance. Additionally, the `_engine_type` initialization logic needs to handle weak references appropriately.

## Bug-fixed Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
    from pandas.errors import PerformanceWarning

    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Create a weak reference to self (PeriodIndex) to avoid reference cycles
        period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)

        try:
            # Construct the _engine_type instance with the weak reference and length
            return self._engine_type(period_weakref, len(self))
        except PerformanceWarning as warning:
            # Handle PerformanceWarning, potentially log or handle accordingly
            warnings.warn(str(warning), PerformanceWarning)
            return None  # Return a default value or handle the situation appropriately
```

This updated version creates a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object (`self`) and passes it to `_engine_type` during initialization. It also handles any potential warnings that may arise during the construction of `_engine_type`.
