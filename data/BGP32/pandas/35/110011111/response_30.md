## Correction

The issue in the `PeriodIndex` class is related to the use of weak referencing in the `_engine` function. The weak reference to `self` is not being maintained properly, leading to an attribute error when accessing the `view()` method.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the weak reference is properly maintained throughout the class lifecycle. One approach is to use a `WeakMethod` to create a weak reference to the method `_engine_type` and bind it to the instance `self`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, create a weak reference to the _engine_type method.
    weak_method = WeakMethod(self._engine_type)
    return weak_method(self)
```

By using `WeakMethod`, we can maintain a weak reference to the `_engine_type` method bound to the instance `self`. This ensures that the reference to `self` is not lost prematurely, resolving the attribute error that was occurring.

With this correction, the `PeriodIndex` class should properly maintain the weak reference to `self` in the `_engine` function, resolving the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
