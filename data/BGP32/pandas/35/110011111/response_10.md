## Analysis
The error message indicates an `AttributeError` occurring in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The failing test is related to weakrefs being lost in a `MultiIndex` operation.

### Potential Error Locations
1. The weak reference creation inside the `_engine` function might not be correctly handled.
2. The initialization of the `PeriodEngine` or access to its attributes might have issues.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug seems related to weak references being lost prematurely, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` object instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`. This results in the `AttributeError` when trying to access an attribute on a `NoneType` object.

### Suggested Fix Strategy
- Ensure proper handling of the weak reference in the `_engine` function.
- Verify that the `PeriodEngine` initialization uses the weak reference correctly.
- Prevent premature loss of weakrefs in `PeriodIndex` operations.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if period() is not None else None
```

In the corrected version, we check if the weak reference to `self` is not `None` before calling the `PeriodEngine` initialization. This will prevent passing a `None` object to the `PeriodEngine`, resolving the AttributeError issue.
