## Bug Analysis
The issue stems from the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class, which is using a weak reference. The error message indicates that a `NoneType` object does not have the attribute `'view'`, pointing towards an issue with the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex`. The failing test indicates that copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` loses weak references.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To resolve this issue, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained correctly. This can be achieved by modifying the implementation of the `_engine` function to handle weak references appropriately.

## Corrected Version

```python
# The corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    index_values = self._data._values  # Get the PeriodArray values
    return self._engine_type(period, len(index_values), index_values)
```

In the corrected version, we retrieve the `PeriodArray` values (`_data._values`) and pass them along with the weak reference to `_engine_type`. This modification ensures that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is retained and utilized correctly within the `_engine` function, resolving the issue reported in the failing test.
