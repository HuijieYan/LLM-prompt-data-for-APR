To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, we need to ensure that the weakly referenced `self` object is properly passed to the `_engine_type` constructor. The current implementation is causing an `AttributeError` due to a `NoneType` object being accessed.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `period()` is called to dereference the weak reference and obtain the actual `self` object before passing it to the `_engine_type` constructor. This ensures that the `self` object is available for accessing attributes and methods in the engine, avoiding the `AttributeError`.

By making this adjustment, the corrected function should pass the failing test case, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue posted in GitHub regarding weakrefs being dropped prematurely.
