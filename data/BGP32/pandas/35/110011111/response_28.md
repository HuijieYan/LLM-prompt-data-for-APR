## Bug Fix

### Error Analysis:
The bug is caused by the weak reference handling in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The `period` variable is defined using `weakref.ref(self)`, but the weak reference is not used correctly when creating the `_engine_type` instance. This leads to an AttributeError in the code when trying to access an attribute of a `NoneType`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to properly handle the weak reference in the `_engine` function while creating the `_engine_type` instance. This involves ensuring that the weak reference is accessed correctly to avoid the `NoneType` error.

### Code Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self)) # Access the weak reference correctly with `()` to get the actual object
```

By accessing the weak reference with `()` when creating the `_engine_type` instance, we ensure that we get the actual object instead of `None`, fixing the bug. This corrected version should fulfill the expected values and resolve the GitHub issue related to losing weakrefs in the `PeriodIndex` levels of `MultiIndex`.
