To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly stored and retrieved when needed. Currently, the `weakref.ref(self)` is assigned to the local variable `period` which goes out of scope once the function exits, resulting in the weak reference being lost.

We need to store the weak reference as an attribute of the `self` object, so it remains available for as long as the object is alive. Then, when `_engine` is called, we retrieve the weak reference from `self` and use it to create the `PeriodEngine`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    self._weakref = weakref.ref(self)  # Store weak reference as an attribute
    return self._engine_type(self._weakref, len(self))  # Use the stored weak reference
```

By storing the weak reference within the `self` object, we ensure that it persists as long as the `PeriodIndex` object is alive, addressing the issue of weakrefs being dropped prematurely.

This change should resolve the error message related to the `NoneType` object attribute and ensure that the function works correctly as expected.
