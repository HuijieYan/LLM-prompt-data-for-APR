To fix the bug in the `_engine` function causing the AttributeError, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly maintained. The current implementation is not correctly handling the weak reference, leading to the error.

We should modify the implementation to store `self` in a weak reference object and then access it through the weak reference to prevent the reference cycle.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period_ref(), len(self))
```

This modification ensures that the weak reference `period_ref` correctly maintains a reference to `self`, allowing the `_engine_type` method to access the `PeriodIndex` instance without causing a reference cycle or losing the reference.
