To fix the bug, it's important to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained properly within the `_engine` function. The error message indicates that an AttributeError is being raised because the `self._engine_type` call is receiving `None` instead of the expected value. This suggests that the weak reference to `self` is not being properly used.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if period() is not None else self._engine_type(None, len(self))
```

Explanation:
- We maintain the weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)`.
- Before returning the `_engine_type` object, we check if the weak reference is still pointing to a valid object by using `if period() is not None`.
- If the weak reference is still valid, we pass `period` to `_engine_type`, otherwise we pass `None`.
- This change ensures that even if the reference to `self` is lost during the function's execution, it will not result in an AttributeError.

By making this adjustment, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and ensure that the weak reference to `self` in the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained properly.
