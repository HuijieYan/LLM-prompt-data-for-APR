To fix the bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained properly. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `PeriodEngine` being passed a `NoneType` object.

The issue seems to be related to the weak reference handling. When the weakly referenced `self` is passed to `_engine_type`, it may not be maintained properly, leading to a `NoneType` object being passed to `PeriodEngine`. This results in the AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute.

To address this issue, we should modify the `_engine` function to hold a strong reference to `self` while still passing a weak reference to `_engine_type`. By doing this, we ensure that the `PeriodIndex` object is kept alive during the `_engine` function execution.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Get a strong reference to self while passing a weak reference to _engine_type
    self_ref = self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self_ref))
```

With this modification, the `PeriodIndex` object will be maintained while being passed as a weak reference to `_engine_type`, resolving the issue with weak reference handling.

This correction should address the AttributeError and ensure that the `PeriodIndex` object is correctly passed to the `PeriodEngine`.
