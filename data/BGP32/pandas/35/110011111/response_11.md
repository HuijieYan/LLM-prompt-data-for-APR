## Bug Analysis:

The bug occurs in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The function is meant to return an instance of `_engine_type` by passing a weak reference to `self`. However, it seems that the weak reference to `self` is not correctly passed, resulting in the error `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.

The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is trying to check if all levels of the `MultiIndex` are monotonic, which involves accessing the `is_monotonic` property. This property eventually calls `is_monotonic_increasing` on the engine, leading to the erroneous behavior due to the issue with `_engine`.

## Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly passed to `_engine_type`. This way, the engine will have a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance.

## Corrected Version:

```python
from pandas.core.arrays.period import PeriodArray
from pandas.core.indexes.numeric import Int64Index
from pandas.core.arrays.period import PeriodEngine

class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    """
    Immutable ndarray holding ordinal values indicating regular periods in time.
    
    Index keys are boxed to Period objects which carries the metadata (eg,
    frequency information).
    """
    
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))

    def _engine_type(self, period_ref, length):
        return PeriodEngine(period_ref, length)
```

In the corrected version, we call `period()` to obtain the `PeriodIndex` instance from the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`. This ensures that a valid reference is passed to the engine, addressing the issue causing the AttributeError.
