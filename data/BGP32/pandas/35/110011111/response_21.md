## Bug Fix

### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is utilizing `weakref.ref` incorrectly, leading to a reference cycle issue. This issue causes the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `NoneType` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.
2. The failing test involves creating a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` and checking if the levels are monotonic. This test fails due to the misuse of `weakref.ref`, resulting in the incorrect behavior of the `PeriodEngine`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_engine` function arises from the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref`. This misuse creates a reference cycle issue, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `NoneType` instead of a valid `PeriodIndex`.

### Proposed Fix:
To resolve the bug, we should avoid using `weakref.ref` in this context. Instead, we can directly pass `self` to the `_engine_type` constructor without creating a weak reference. This change will prevent the reference cycle issue and ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives the correct `PeriodIndex` instance.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
``` 

By directly passing `self` to the `_engine_type` constructor, we avoid the reference cycle problem associated with `weakref.ref`, ensuring that the `PeriodEngine` receives the expected `PeriodIndex` instance.
