To fix the bug in the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained correctly. The issue is related to weakrefs dropping prematurely, leading to the `NoneType` error when trying to access the weakly referenced object.

Based on the analysis, the buggy function `_engine` does not properly maintain the weak reference due to implementation issues, causing the weakref object to be lost before being accessed, leading to the attribute error.

To address this issue, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` remains valid throughout the function's execution. One way to achieve this is to store `self` in a local variable within the function, ensuring that the weak reference is not lost prematurely.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store self in a local variable to maintain the weak reference
    period_index = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_index, len(self))
```

By storing `self` in the `period_index` variable, we maintain a reference to it throughout the function, ensuring that the weakref remains valid when accessed later on. This fix should prevent the attribute error caused by the premature loss of the weak reference.
