## Bug Fixing Strategy
The bug likely stems from the weak reference `period` not being used correctly when creating the `_engine` object. The weak reference might lead to `self` being deallocated before being referenced, causing the `_engine` to have a `NoneType`. To fix this issue, we should ensure that the weak reference is properly utilized and that the `PeriodIndex` instance is kept alive until `_engine` is created.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    self_period = period()
    return self._engine_type(self_period, len(self))
```

By modifying the implementation in this way, we ensure that a strong reference to `self` is maintained during the process of creating the `_engine` object, preventing premature deallocation. This should resolve the issue and prevent the `NoneType` error from occurring.
