To fix the bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class, we need to ensure that the weak reference is properly maintained until needed. The error occurs because the weak reference is dropped before it is used by `PeriodEngine`, resulting in a `NoneType` error.

To address this issue, we can modify the `_engine` function to store the weak reference in a class variable so that it exists as long as the class instance exists. This guarantees that the reference will be available when needed by `PeriodEngine`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a weak reference to self in a class variable
    PeriodIndex._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference in a class variable `_period_ref`, we ensure that the reference remains valid as long as the class instance exists. This should resolve the `NoneType` error encountered during the failing test.

Please update the `PeriodIndex` class with this corrected `_engine` function and ensure that the failing test now passes without any errors.
