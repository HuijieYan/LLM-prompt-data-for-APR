## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class appears to be intended to create an instance of the `_engine_type` using a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance. However, based on the error message and the failed test case, it seems that the weak reference is not being properly resolved, leading to an AttributeError when trying to access an attribute on a NoneType object.

The failing test involves creating a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` and checking if the resulting levels are monotonic. The bug causes the weak reference to become lost, resulting in a NoneType object being accessed later on, leading to the error.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs due to the weak reference not being properly maintained, causing the referenced object to be garbage collected prematurely, resulting in a NoneType object where it is not expected.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance should be stored in a stronger reference (like a class attribute) to prevent it from being garbage collected. This will ensure that the `_engine_type` can correctly access the `PeriodIndex` instance when needed.

## Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store weakref in a class attribute
    self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```
