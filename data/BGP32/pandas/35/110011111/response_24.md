To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is kept until it is used by `_engine_type`.

The issue seems to be related to the weak reference `period` being used incorrectly. In the current implementation, the reference `period` is defined inside the `_engine` function and is returned without a persistent reference. This leads to the weak reference being lost when passed to `_engine_type`, resulting in a `NoneType` error later on.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to properly maintain the weak reference. We can achieve this by storing the weak reference as an attribute of the `self` object.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a weak reference of self as an attribute to maintain the reference
    self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference as an attribute (`self._period_weakref`), we ensure that the reference is maintained throughout the lifespan of the `self` object. This modification should resolve the issue and prevent the `NoneType` error encountered during the test execution.
