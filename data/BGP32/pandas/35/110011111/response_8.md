To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained correctly to prevent it from being dropped prematurely. This premature dropping results in the `NoneType` error observed during the failing test.

We can address the issue by modifying the `_engine` function to maintain the weak reference properly. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    class FixedPeriodEngine(PeriodEngine):
        def __init__(self, period, length):
            super().__init__(period, length)
            self._wrapped = period()
    
    return FixedPeriodEngine(period, len(self))
```

By creating a `FixedPeriodEngine` class that holds a reference to the weakly-referenced `self`, we prevent the weak reference from being prematurely dropped. This ensures that the `PeriodEngine` can operate correctly without encountering the `NoneType` error.

With this corrected version, the failing test should now pass without any attribute errors.
