### Fixing the Bug
The bug occurs because the weak reference to self (PeriodIndex) is mistakenly passed as a direct reference to the `_engine_type` without properly accessing the referenced object. This results in `_engine` returning `None`, causing the subsequent error.

To fix the bug, we need to properly access the object referenced by the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`. Additionally, we should perform error handling in case the object has been garbage collected.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Check if the weakly referenced object still exists
    if weakref.getweakrefcount(self) == 0:
        raise RuntimeError("Weakly referenced object has been garbage collected.")
    
    # Retrieve the referenced object from the weak reference
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    
    if period is None:
        raise RuntimeError("Weakly referenced object has been garbage collected.")
    
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By including the checks for the existence of the weakly referenced object and handling the case where it has been garbage collected, we ensure that the `_engine` function properly accesses the PeriodIndex to create the engine instance, preventing the `NoneType` error. This fix should resolve the failing tests and address the reported issue on GitHub.
