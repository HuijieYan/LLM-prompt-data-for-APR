To fix the bug in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained correctly. The issue arises from the weak reference being dropped prematurely, resulting in an inappropriate value (`None`) being passed to the `_engine_type`. This incorrect reference leads to the AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute.

To resolve this issue, we should modify the `_engine` function to correctly maintain the weak reference to `self`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    class WeakRefPeriodEngine(PeriodEngine):
        def __init__(self, weakref_self, *args, **kwargs):
            self.weakref_self = weakref_self
            super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        
        @property
        def frame(self):
            return self.weakref_self().values

    return WeakRefPeriodEngine(period, self, len(self))
```

In this corrected version, we create a subclass `WeakRefPeriodEngine` of `PeriodEngine` to hold the weak reference to `self`. By passing `period` (the weak reference) and `self` to `WeakRefPeriodEngine` during initialization, we maintain a proper reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance.

This modification ensures that the weak reference remains valid throughout the execution of the engine functions. As a result, the error related to the `view` attribute of `NoneType` should be resolved, and the test case mentioned should pass successfully.
