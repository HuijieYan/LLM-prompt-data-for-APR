Based on the analysis of the buggy function, it seems that the issue lies in the `return super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter().view("i8")` line of code, specifically in the `vgetter()` method returning a `NoneType` object, causing the `AttributeError`. The function `_engine` is meant to create an instance of `PeriodEngine` but is not handling the weak reference properly, leading to the `NoneType`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is handled correctly. This can be achieved by modifying the `_engine` function to properly handle the weak reference, ultimately returning the correct instance of `PeriodEngine`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    
    class WeakPeriodIndex(PeriodIndex):
        def _engine_type(self_weakref, len):
            return PeriodEngine(period_ref(), len)
    
    return WeakPeriodIndex(period_ref(), len(self))
```

In this corrected version, we create a nested class `WeakPeriodIndex` that stores a reference to the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object. We then instantiate `WeakPeriodIndex` with the weak reference and use it to create the `PeriodEngine` instance. This way, we ensure that the weak reference is properly handled throughout the process, avoiding the `NoneType` issue.

After applying this fix, the function should properly return the `PeriodEngine` object, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and passing the failing test case.
