To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained properly. The issue is related to the weak reference being lost before it's intended to be used, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` object instead of a `PeriodIndex`.

One strategy to address this is to store the weak reference to `self` within a variable that persists throughout the function's life cycle. By doing so, we can prevent premature garbage collection of the weak reference.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    
    def create_engine():
        return self._engine_type(period_ref(), len(self))
    
    return create_engine()
```

In this improvement, we create a closure `create_engine` that encapsulates the generation of the `_engine` object. The weak reference is now properly retained within the closure, ensuring that it remains available for the entire duration of the function's execution.

This fix should address the issue raised in the GitHub bug report and provide the expected outcomes for the failing test cases.
