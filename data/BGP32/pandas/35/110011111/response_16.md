To fix the bug in the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly passed to the `_engine_type` constructor. The error message is indicating that the `PeriodEngine` is receiving a `NoneType` object instead of the expected reference to `self`.

Here is a corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In this corrected version, the `period` function is called to access the reference stored in the weak reference object, ensuring that a valid reference to `self` is passed to the `_engine_type` constructor.

By making this change, the function should now correctly return an instance of `_engine_type` with the expected weak reference to `self`, resolving the AttributeError experienced during the failing test. The corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
