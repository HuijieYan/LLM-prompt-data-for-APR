To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained correctly. The current implementation fails to retain the reference, resulting in `None` being passed to `_engine_type`. This causes the `AttributeError` during execution.

To address this issue, we can modify the function to correctly store the weak reference using the `weakref.proxy` method to prevent the reference cycle from being broken prematurely.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we maintain a valid weak reference to `self`, ensuring that it remains accessible when passed to `_engine_type`.

This correction should resolve the `AttributeError` issue and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
