After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test, it seems that the issue lies in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The `_engine` function is supposed to create an engine instance, but it fails to pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`, leading to the `AttributeError`.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `_engine` function to correctly pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`. By ensuring that the reference to `self` is maintained correctly, we can avoid the `NoneType` error when trying to access the engine's properties.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By modifying the `_engine` function to pass `period()` instead of just `period`, we can ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained correctly, resolving the `AttributeError` issue when accessing the engine's properties.

This fix should address the problem reported in the GitHub issue and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
