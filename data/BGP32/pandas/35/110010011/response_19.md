### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `@cache_readonly` method in the `PeriodIndex` class.
2. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` with `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.
3. The GitHub issue mentions that weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` levels are being lost, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` object instead of the `PeriodIndex`.
4. The bug occurs due to weak referencing issues in the `_engine` method, where the reference to `self` is lost before it should be.
5. The bug can be fixed by modifying the weak reference usage to ensure that the reference to `self` remains valid.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained correctly throughout the `_engine` method. This can be done by storing `self` in a variable before creating a weak reference. By capturing a reference to `self` in a local variable, we can ensure that it is not garbage-collected prematurely.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Fixing the weak reference issue in the _engine method
def _engine(self):
    this = self  # Store a reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(this)  # Use the local reference to create the weak reference
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

This correction ensures that the reference to `self` is maintained until the weak reference `period` is created. This should resolve the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` levels being dropped issue, and the corrected version should pass the failing test and address the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
