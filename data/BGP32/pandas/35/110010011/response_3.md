### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is intended to return an instance of `PeriodEngine` by passing a weak reference of the `PeriodIndex` object to the `_engine_type`.
2. The error occurs when using the `is_monotonic` property on the MultiIndex levels, as it tries to access `self._engine.is_monotonic_increasing`, which leads to an AttributeError due to a `NoneType` object.
3. The bug is related to weak referencing not working as intended, causing `self._engine` to be `None`, resulting in the AttributeError when accessing properties on it.
4. The bug can be fixed by ensuring that the weak reference of `self` assigned to `period` in the `_engine` function is maintained properly until `PeriodEngine` creation.


### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` remains valid until the `PeriodEngine` object is created. We can achieve this by storing the weak reference in an attribute of the instance. This approach ensures that the weak reference does not get garbage collected prematurely.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The buggy function is fixed here

from pandas.core.dtypes.common import PeriodDtype
from pandas.core.indexes.datetimes import DatetimeIndexOpsMixin
from pandas.core.arrays.period import PeriodArray, PeriodEngine
from pandas.util._decorators import inherit_names, Appender, cache_readonly, doc

# Corrected the buggy function to maintain the weak reference correctly
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, store a weakref to self in an attribute
    if not hasattr(self, '_period_weakref'):
        self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    
    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference in the `self._period_weakref` attribute, we ensure that it remains valid and does not get garbage collected prematurely. This correction should resolve the issue and prevent the AttributeError when accessing properties on the `PeriodEngine` object.
