### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` defined within the `PeriodIndex` class is using a weak reference to avoid a reference cycle.
2. The error message indicates that the `vgetter()` method of `PeriodEngine` is returning `None`, leading to an `AttributeError`.
3. The GitHub issue states that copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` loses weak references, causing `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained properly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the weak reference not being retained correctly in the `_engine` method. When the `PeriodEngine` tries to access the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex`, it receives `None` instead of the expected object, leading to the `AttributeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is preserved throughout the lifetime of the `PeriodEngine`. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference as an attribute of the `PeriodIndex` instance, ensuring that the reference is not lost prematurely.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Updated _engine method with modified weakref handling
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    if not hasattr(self, '_period_weakref'):  # Check if weak reference already exists
        self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)  # Store weak reference to PeriodIndex

    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))  # Pass weak reference to PeriodEngine
```

By storing the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance within the instance itself, we ensure that the reference is maintained throughout the `PeriodEngine` lifetime. This modification should address the bug and resolve the `AttributeError` as described in the failing test and GitHub issue.
