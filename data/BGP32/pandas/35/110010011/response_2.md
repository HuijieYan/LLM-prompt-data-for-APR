### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is part of the `PeriodIndex` class, which is responsible for creating an engine type using a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object.
2. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` related to a `NoneType` object not having the attribute `view`, which suggests that the `_engine` is not being created correctly, resulting in a `NoneType` instead of the intended `PeriodEngine` object.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the problem where weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` levels are being lost in `MultiIndex`, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object not being properly maintained, leading to the `_engine` method returning a `None` object instead of the expected `PeriodEngine` object.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is correctly passed to the `_engine_type` method and maintained throughout the operation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `period()` is called immediately after creating the weak reference. This ensures that the weak reference is converted to a strong reference when passed to the `_engine_type`, preventing the issue of receiving a `NoneType` object.
