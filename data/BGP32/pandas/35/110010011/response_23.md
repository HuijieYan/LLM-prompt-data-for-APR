### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` method in the `PeriodIndex` class.
2. The error message indicates an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` when trying to access the method `view("i8")` on a `NoneType` object.
3. The issue on GitHub highlights the problem of weak reference dropping before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.
4. The bug seems to be related to weak referencing the `PeriodIndex` object, which is not working as expected.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained properly so that the `PeriodEngine` receives a valid reference.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained throughout the `_engine` method.
2. Use a `ref` object to hold the reference to `self`, ensuring it remains valid when passed to the `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use ref to hold a reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if period() is not None else None
```

This corrected version ensures that the reference to `self` (the `PeriodIndex` object) is maintained throughout the `_engine` method by checking if the reference is not `None`. This way, the `PeriodEngine` will receive a valid reference, preventing the `NoneType` error.
