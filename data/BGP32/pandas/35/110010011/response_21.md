### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a method of the `PeriodIndex` class. It is decorated with `@cache_readonly`, indicating that the result will be cached for future use.
2. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` with `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, which suggests that the `_engine` method is returning `None` instead of the intended object.
3. The GitHub issue mentions that weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped prematurely, causing `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.
4. The bug needs to be fixed by ensuring that the weak reference to `self` is maintained properly within the `_engine` method to avoid premature dropping.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is preserved until the `_engine_type` object is created and returned. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference to `self` in a local variable before creating and returning the `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)  # Store weak reference to self
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

By capturing a weak reference to `self` in the `period_ref` variable before using it to create the `_engine_type` object, we ensure that the reference is not prematurely dropped, fixing the bug.
