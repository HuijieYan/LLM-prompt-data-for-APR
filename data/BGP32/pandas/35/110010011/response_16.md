### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is meant to return an instance of the `_engine_type` class, passing a weak reference of `self` (an instance of `PeriodIndex`) as an argument. However, the weak reference is being incorrectly assigned to the `period` variable instead of being passed directly to the `_engine_type`.
- This bug results in a `NoneType` object being used instead of the intended `PeriodIndex` instance, leading to an AttributeError when attempting to access attributes or methods on the `NoneType`.

### Bug Cause:
- In the buggy function `_engine`, the weak reference is stored in the `period` variable but not actually being used when calling `_engine_type`.
- Due to this incorrect usage, the `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` call receives `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex` instance. This causes an AttributeError later when trying to access the `view` method on `None`.

### Fix Strategy:
- Instead of assigning the weak reference to a variable, the corrected version of the function should directly pass the weak reference of `self` to the `_engine_type` constructor.
- This change will ensure that the `_engine_type` receives the actual `PeriodIndex` instance as intended, resolving the AttributeError issue.

### Corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Pass a weakref of self directly to _engine_type
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```

By making this correction, the weak reference of `self` will be properly passed to the `_engine_type`, preserving the intended reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance. This should resolve the AttributeError issue mentioned in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
