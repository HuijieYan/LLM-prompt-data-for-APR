### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is intended to return an `_engine_type` instance with a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance to avoid reference cycles.
2. The error message indicates an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` which means that `self._engine` is returning `None`, causing subsequent issues.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the problem as an issue where weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` elements are being dropped prematurely, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance is held correctly to prevent it from being garbage collected prematurely.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is causing the `_engine` function to return `None` instead of the intended `_engine_type` instance due to premature garbage collection of the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance is held correctly within `_engine` function.
2. Implement a mechanism to prevent premature garbage collection of the weak reference.
3. Check if the weak reference is still alive before attempting to use it.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `weakref.proxy(self)` is used to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance without triggering premature garbage collection. This ensures that the weak reference remains valid while creating the `_engine_type` instance.
