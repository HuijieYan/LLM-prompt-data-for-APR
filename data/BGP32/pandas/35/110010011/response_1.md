### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is part of the `PeriodIndex` class, which inherits from `Int64Index` and `DatetimeIndexOpsMixin`.
2. The error occurs when attempting to access the attribute `view("i8")` on a `NoneType` object in the `_engine` method.
3. The bug is related to a weak reference cycle handling issue when constructing the `PeriodEngine` with a weak reference to `self`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly handled and is not lost prematurely, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` object.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_engine` method arises because the weak reference `period` is assigned but not properly used when constructing the `PeriodEngine`. This leads to the `NoneType` object error when trying to access the attribute `view("i8")`. The weak reference to `self` is not maintained correctly, leading to the issue.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly handled throughout the construction of the `PeriodEngine`. This involves making sure that the weak reference is accessed appropriately in the `_engine` method when creating the `PeriodEngine`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, the weak reference `period` is called `period()` when constructing the `PeriodEngine`, ensuring that it does not lose the reference to `self`. This should resolve the issue and prevent the `NoneType` error.
