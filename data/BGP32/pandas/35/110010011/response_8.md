### Analysis:
1. The function `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class is supposed to return an instance of the `_engine_type` class with a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object.
2. The error message indicates that an AttributeError occurs when trying to access the `view` attribute of a `NoneType` object in the `_engine` function.
3. The GitHub issue suggests that weak references are not handled correctly, resulting in weak references being dropped prematurely, leading to the AttributeError when accessing the `view` attribute.
4. The strategy to fix the bug would involve ensuring that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained and not dropped prematurely before accessing its attributes.

### Proposed Fix:
We need to ensure that the weak reference to the `self` object in the `_engine` function is maintained until it is used in `_engine_type`. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference as an instance variable of the `PeriodIndex` class. Then, we can use this weak reference when calling `_engine_type` to avoid the premature dropping of the reference.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a weak reference to the PeriodIndex object
    self._weak_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._weak_ref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference as an instance variable (`self._weak_ref`), we ensure that the reference is not dropped prematurely, allowing the `_engine_type` to correctly access the `PeriodIndex` object when needed. This fix should resolve the AttributeError issue and address the problem described in the GitHub issue.
