### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is causing a reference cycle issue when using weak references.
2. The error message indicates that the `_engine` function is returning a `NoneType` object instead of the expected output, leading to an `AttributeError`.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the problem with weak references in copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` object instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained properly to prevent the reference cycle issue.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is the premature dropping of the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex`, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` object instead of the expected `PeriodIndex` during the operation.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to properly handle the weak reference to `self` and ensure that it does not get garbage collected prematurely.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Prevent reference cycle and maintain weak reference using a lambda function
    # that returns a new reference to self during the engine creation.
    return self._engine_type(lambda: self, len(self))
``` 

By using a lambda function to create a new reference to `self` during the engine creation, we ensure that the weak reference is maintained properly, avoiding premature dropping of the `PeriodIndex`, resolving the reference cycle issue.
