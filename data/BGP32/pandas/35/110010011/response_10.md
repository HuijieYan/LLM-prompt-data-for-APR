### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` function within the `PeriodIndex` class. Its purpose is to return an instance of `_engine_type` class by passing a weak reference of the `PeriodIndex` instance and its length.
2. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `PeriodEngine` where a `NoneType` object is encountered while trying to access the `view` attribute. This error is observed during the `is_monotonic` check for the `PeriodIndex`.
3. The GitHub issue suggests that weakrefs are lost during the creation of `MultiIndex` from `PeriodIndex`, leading to the `NoneType` error when accessing attributes of the `PeriodEngine`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weakref is correctly implemented to maintain the reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance within the `_engine` function.
5. We will need to modify the `_engine` function to use a weak reference properly and ensure that it does not lose the reference prematurely.

### Bug Fix:
```python
from pandas.core.arrays import PeriodEngine

class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    # Existing class code
    
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return PeriodEngine(period, len(self))
```

By modifying the `_engine` function to correctly use `weakref.ref(self)`, the `PeriodEngine` will maintain a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance. This fix should resolve the issue in the failing test identified in the GitHub issue.
