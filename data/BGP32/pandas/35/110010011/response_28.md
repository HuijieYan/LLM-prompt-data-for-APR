### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `@cache_readonly` method defined in the `PeriodIndex` class from the `pandas.core.indexes.period` module.
2. The error message indicates an AttributeError related to `self._engine.is_monotonic_increasing`, suggesting the issue is causing a `NoneType` object.
3. Based on the GitHub issue, there is a problem with weak references in `PeriodIndex` levels when copying on `MultiIndex`, leading to the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped prematurely.

### Bug Cause:
The `_engine` function is supposed to return `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, where `period` is a weak reference to `self`. However, due to the premature dropping of weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` levels in a `MultiIndex`, the weak reference is lost, resulting in `self._engine` being `None` when needed later.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained properly until it's no longer needed. One way to achieve this is by modifying the way the weak reference is handled to ensure it remains valid.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Maintain a weakref reference of self throughout the function
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    
    def get_engine():
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    # Return the engine only if the weak reference is still valid
    if isinstance(period(), PeriodIndex):
        return get_engine()
    else:
        raise RuntimeError("Weak reference to PeriodIndex lost prematurely.")
```

By explicitly checking if the weak reference is still valid before returning the engine, we ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is retained until the engine is created and then safely discarded. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
