### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference `period`, but the reference to `period` is not used and the weak reference itself is not being accessed when creating the `_engine_type`.
- This results in the weak reference being immediately garbage collected, leading to the error where `self._engine_type(...)` receives a `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug lies in the fact that the weak reference `period` is created but not used further in the function. As a result, the weak reference is garbage collected and the `_engine_type` function receives a `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference created by `weakref.ref(self)` is properly utilized and retained so that it doesn't get garbage collected prematurely. We can store the weak reference in an instance variable of the `PeriodIndex` class to ensure its persistence and proper usage.

### Corrected Version:

```python
    # Corrected version of the function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Store the weak reference in an instance variable
        self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

In this corrected version, we are storing the weak reference `period` in the instance variable `_period_weakref`. This ensures that the weak reference persists as long as the `PeriodIndex` object is alive and can be used when creating the `_engine_type`. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
