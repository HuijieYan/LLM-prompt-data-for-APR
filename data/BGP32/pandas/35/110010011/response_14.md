### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `@cache_readonly` method within the `PeriodIndex` class.
2. The error message indicates that an AttributeError occurs when trying to access the `view` attribute on a `NoneType` object within the `_do_monotonic_check` method of the `IndexEngine`.
3. The issue on GitHub points out that copying of `PeriodIndex` levels on a `MultiIndex` results in losing weakrefs, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.
4. To fix this issue, the weakref of `self` passed to the `_engine_type` constructor needs to be maintained correctly.
5. The strategy for fixing the bug would involve ensuring that the weak reference `period` to `self` is valid and accessible within the `_engine` method.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the weak reference `period` is created within the `_engine` method and then returned to the `_engine_type` constructor. However, the weak reference to `self` is lost before being accessed within the `PeriodEngine`, leading to a `NoneType` error when trying to access attributes.

### Fix:
1. Modify the `_engine` method to store the weak reference to `self` as an instance variable instead of a local variable, ensuring it remains accessible.
2. Update the `_engine` method to use the instance-level weak reference `self._period` when calling the `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected version of the _engine method in the PeriodIndex class

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, store a weakref of self in an instance variable
    self._period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period, len(self))
```

By making the above change, the weak reference to `self` will be maintained correctly, resolving the issue of losing weakrefs and preventing the AttributeError in the `IndexEngine`.
