### Error Analysis:
- **Buggy Function**: The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is decorated with `@cache_readonly`, which indicates that it should cache its return value and be read-only.
- **Cause of the Bug**: The error message indicates that the `_engine` function is returning a `NoneType` object which leads to an `AttributeError`.
- The GitHub issue further explains that weak references to `PeriodIndex` levels are lost during the copying process, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the intended reference.
- The bug originates from the fact that weak referencing was not handled properly when creating the `_engine` object.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To address this bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to correctly handle the creation of weak references. Ensuring that the `PeriodIndex` object is kept alive until the `PeriodEngine` is done using it should fix the issue.

### Corrected Version of the `_engine` function:
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```

By using the `weakref.ref(self)` as the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object, we ensure that the `PeriodIndex` is kept alive while the `PeriodEngine` is using it, resolving the weak reference loss issue.
