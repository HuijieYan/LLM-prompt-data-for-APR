### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` decorator function in the `PeriodIndex` class from the `pandas` library.
2. The function attempts to create a weak reference to `self` (a `PeriodIndex` instance) and then calls `_engine_type` with that reference and the length of `self`.
3. The error message indicates that an AttributeError is raised due to a 'NoneType' object not having the attribute 'view'. This issue seems to be related to weak referencing handling.
4. The GitHub issue describes the problem with copying `PeriodIndex` levels in a `MultiIndex`, leading to the weak ref getting lost before the intended calculation.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` (`PeriodIndex` instance) is maintained properly.

### Bug Cause:
When creating a weak reference to `self` in the `_engine` function, the function `period = weakref.ref(self)` is not correctly maintaining the reference. This causes the weak reference to become invalid before its usage in `_engine_type`.

### Fix Strategy:
The weak reference handling needs to be improved so that the reference to `self` remains valid when used in `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a strong reference to self to avoid premature garbage collection
    strong_self = self
    period = weakref.ref(strong_self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(strong_self))
```

In the corrected version, we create a strong reference (`strong_self`) to `self` before creating a weak reference to ensure that `self` remains in scope during the weak reference's usage. This modification should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
