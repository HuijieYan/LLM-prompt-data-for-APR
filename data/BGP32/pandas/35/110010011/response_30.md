### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_engine` is responsible for returning an instance of `_engine_type` with a weak reference to `self`. However, there seems to be an issue where the weak reference is not being properly maintained.
- The error message indicates an `AttributeError` with a `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, which suggests that the weak reference might be losing its reference to the `PeriodIndex` object.
- The GitHub issue relates to the problem in maintaining weak references in a `MultiIndex` context, resulting in an unexpected `NoneType` error.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the weak reference `period` potentially losing reference to the `PeriodIndex` object. This can lead to the `_engine_type` function expecting a `PeriodIndex` instance but receiving a `NoneType` object, resulting in the `AttributeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly maintained throughout the `_engine` function. We can explicitly store the weak reference outside the function scope to prevent it from being garbage collected prematurely.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))

# Store the weak reference outside the function scope
engine_period = weakref.ref(_engine)
```
