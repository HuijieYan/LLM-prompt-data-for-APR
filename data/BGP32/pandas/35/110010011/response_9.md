### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is intended to return an instance of the `_engine_type` with a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object. This weak reference is meant to prevent a reference cycle.
2. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` where a `NoneType` object does not have the attribute `view`, suggesting that the `_engine` function might not be returning a valid `_engine_type` instance.
3. Based on the GitHub issue, it seems that the weak reference of `PeriodIndex` is being dropped prematurely, leading to the `_engine` function returning `None` instead of a valid instance of `_engine_type`.
4. To fix the bug, ensure that the weak reference to `PeriodIndex` is maintained throughout the lifetime of the `_engine` instance.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` (the `PeriodIndex` object) is maintained throughout the function lifetime. We can achieve this by storing the weak reference as an attribute of the `PeriodIndex` class instead of as a local variable within the `_engine` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference as an attribute of the PeriodIndex class
    self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference as an attribute of the `PeriodIndex` class, we ensure that the reference remains valid throughout the lifecycle of the `_engine` function. This should resolve the `AttributeError` observed in the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
