### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function**: The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is supposed to return an instance of the `_engine_type` class using a weak reference to `self`.
   
2. **Error Location**: The issue seems to arise from the usage of the weak reference `period` in the `_engine` function.

3. **Bug Cause**:
   - The error message indicates that a 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'. This suggests that the weak reference created in `_engine` is not functioning as intended, leading to a None object being passed to `_engine_type`.
   - The GitHub issue also mentions that weak references are being dropped prematurely, causing `_do_monotonic_check` to receive a None object instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.
   
4. **Strategy for Fixing**:
    - To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` remains valid until it is used by `_engine_type`.
    - One way to achieve this is to store a strong reference to `self` in the `PeriodIndex` instance itself before creating the weak reference. This way, the `PeriodIndex` instance will not be prematurely garbage collected.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class PeriodIndex(DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):
    # Other class definitions...
    
    def __init__(self, data=None, copy=False, freq=None, year=None, month=None, quarter=None, 
                 day=None, hour=None, minute=None, second=None, tz=None, dtype=None):
        super().__init__(data=data, copy=copy, freq=freq, year=year, month=month, quarter=quarter,
                         day=day, hour=hour, minute=minute, second=second, tz=tz, dtype=dtype)
        # Store a strong reference to self
        self._period_index = self

    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self._period_index)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By storing a strong reference to `self` in `_period_index`, we ensure that the `PeriodIndex` instance is not garbage collected before `_engine_type` uses the weak reference. This corrected version should resolve the weak reference issue and pass the failing test.
