### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine()` within the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self` which is then passed to `_engine_type` function.
2. The error message indicates that an `AttributeError` is raised because a `NoneType` object has no attribute `view`. This error occurs during the execution of the `_do_monotonic_check()` method when trying to retrieve index values from the `_engine`.
3. The bug causes the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to be dropped prematurely, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` object instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

### Bug Cause:
The weak reference to `self` (`period = weakref.ref(self)`) in the `_engine()` function is not correctly maintained, leading to premature deallocation of the referenced object.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` remains valid throughout the execution in `_engine()` function. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference as an instance attribute.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    # Corrected _engine function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Store a weak reference to self
        self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
``` 

By storing the weak reference as an instance attribute (`self._period_weakref`), we can prevent it from being prematurely deallocated. This corrected version should resolve the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
