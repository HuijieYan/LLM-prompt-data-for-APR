### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, but it seems like the weak reference is not properly maintained causing the issue.
2. The error message indicates that an AttributeError is raised when trying to access an attribute on a `NoneType` object.
3. The bug is related to `weakrefs` not correctly maintaining the reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance, resulting in `None` type accessed during the engine operations.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly maintained throughout the lifetime of the `PeriodIndex` instance.
5. Based on the issue reported on GitHub, the weak reference to `PeriodIndex` levels is lost on copying to `MultiIndex`, leading to the error. We need to ensure consistent handling of weak references.

### Fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure the weak reference to `self` is correctly maintained. We can achieve this by modifying the `_engine` function implementation. Here's the corrected version:

```python
# Modified version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Enable weak reference and store it in an attribute to maintain the reference
    self._weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._weakref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference in an attribute `_weakref` of the `PeriodIndex` instance, we ensure that the reference is maintained and accessible during engine operations. This modification should resolve the bug and pass the failing test.

### Updated Code:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@inherit_names(['strftime', 'to_timestamp', 'asfreq', 'start_time', 'end_time'] + PeriodArray._field_ops, PeriodArray, wrap=True)
@inherit_names(['is_leap_year', 'freq', '_format_native_types'], PeriodArray)

        Optional period-like data to construct index with.
    copy : bool
        Make a copy of input ndarray.
    freq : str or period object, optional
        One of pandas period strings or corresponding objects.
    year : int, array, or Series, default None
    month : int, array, or Series, default None
    quarter : int, array, or Series, default None
    day : int, array, or Series, default None
    hour : int, array, or Series, default None
    minute : int, array, or Series, default None
    second : int, array, or Series, default None
    tz : object, default None
        Timezone for converting datetime64 data to Periods.
    dtype : str or PeriodDtype, default None

    period_range : Create a fixed-frequency PeriodIndex.
    
    Examples
    --------
    >>> idx = pd.PeriodIndex(year=year_arr, quarter=q_arr)
    """

    # Modified version of the buggy function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Enable weak reference and store it in an attribute to maintain the reference
        self._weakref = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(self._weakref, len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference to `self` should be properly maintained, resolving the issue and passing the failing test.
