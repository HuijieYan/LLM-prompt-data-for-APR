### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.
2. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` with the message `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.
3. The GitHub issue describes a similar scenario where copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` loses weak references, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.
4. The cause of the bug is likely related to the weak reference handling in the `_engine` function, where the weak reference to `self` is not preserved correctly, resulting in a `None` object being passed when creating the `PeriodEngine`.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained correctly to prevent it from being dropped prematurely.

### Solution:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))  # Use period() to get the weak reference object
    
# Optionally, you can also modify the __init__ method of the PeriodIndex class to ensure weak reference handling.
def __init__(self, data=None, freq=None, copy=False, **kwargs):
    super().__init__(data=data, freq=freq, copy=copy, **kwargs)
    # Save a weak reference to self for internal use
    self._weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    
# Update in the constructor call
engine = self._engine_type(self._weakref(), len(self))  # Use self._weakref() to retrieve the weak reference object

```

By correcting the weak reference handling in the `_engine` function and possibly in the constructor, we ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained correctly, avoiding the issue of passing a `NoneType` object to the `PeriodEngine`.
