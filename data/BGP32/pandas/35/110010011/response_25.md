### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` where `period` is a weak reference to `self`. The intention is to avoid a reference cycle.
2. The error occurs when trying to access `self._engine.is_monotonic_increasing` in the failing test, which results in an `AttributeError` due to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `NoneType` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.
3. The bug relates to weak reference usage in the `_engine` function, causing the expected `PeriodIndex` to be lost during the operation. This leads to a `NoneType` error when accessing the `PeriodEngine`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `period` reference holds the `self` object properly during the `_engine` function execution to prevent losing the weak reference.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Revise the weak reference usage to ensure that `self` is properly maintained and not lost during the `_engine` function execution.
- Ensure that the `PeriodIndex` object is correctly passed as the reference to the `PeriodEngine` to avoid the `NoneType` error.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By directly passing `self` instead of a weak reference to `self` in the `_engine` function, we ensure that the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained correctly without being lost. This fix should resolve the `AttributeError` related to the `NoneType` object and make the failing test pass.
