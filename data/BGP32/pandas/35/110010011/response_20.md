### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is causing an AttributeError when accessed during the test scenario `test_get_level_values_when_periods`. This error is related to the `PeriodEngine` not receiving the intended `PeriodIndex`.
2. The `PeriodEngine` is unable to retrieve the correct values due to the weak reference being dropped prematurely.
3. The cause of the bug is that the weak reference to `self` (`period`) is not being used correctly in creating the `_engine`. This leads to the `_engine` returning `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until the `_engine` is created.

### Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug, the weak reference `period` should be accessed in a way that prevents it from being prematurely garbage collected. One way to accomplish this is by storing the weak reference in a separate variable outside of the `_cache_readonly` decorator.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version with the bug fixed
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)  # Store the weak reference separately
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```
