### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is supposed to return an instance of `_engine_type` initialized with a weak reference of `self` which is a `PeriodIndex`.
2. The error occurs when trying to access the view of the `PeriodEngine` instance returned by `_engine` during the test execution.
3. The error message indicates that a `NoneType` object is being used in a context where an attribute `view` is expected. This suggests that the `PeriodEngine` instance is not correctly initialized.
4. The issue on GitHub highlights that weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` objects are being dropped prematurely, leading to `None` being passed to the `PeriodEngine`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by prematurely dropping the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object before passing it to the `PeriodEngine`, resulting in a `NoneType` error when trying to access the attributes of the `_engine` instance.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained throughout the `_engine` function and correctly passed to the `_engine_type` constructor.

### Corrected Version of the `_engine` Function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    def _create_engine(period, length):
        return self._engine_type(period, length)
    return _create_engine(period, len(self))
``` 

By modifying the `_engine` function to create `_engine_type` instance within a nested function `_create_engine` along with the weak reference to `self`, we ensure that the weak reference is not lost prematurely. This corrected version should resolve the `NoneType` error and pass the failing test.
