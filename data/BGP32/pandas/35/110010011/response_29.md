### Analysis:
- **Buggy Function**: The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is returning the `_engine_type` with a weak reference to `self`. The issue arises when the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped early, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` object instead of the `PeriodIndex`.
- **Error Message**: The error message indicates an `AttributeError` due to a `NoneType` object having no `view` attribute.
- **GitHub Issue**: The issue highlights the loss of weakrefs when copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex`, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

### Error Location:
The error is occurring in the `_engine` function where the weak reference to `self` is being used to create the `PeriodEngine`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by premature dropping of the weak reference to `self` before the `PeriodEngine` attempts to access it, resulting in a `NoneType` being retrieved instead of the original `PeriodIndex`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` (`PeriodIndex`) remains valid until it is accessed by the `PeriodEngine`. This can be achieved by modifying the `_engine` function to maintain the weak reference properly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Pass a weakref of self to _engine_type that will maintain the reference.
    weak_period_index = weakref.ref(self)
    
    class WeakPeriodEngine(PeriodEngine):
        def __init__(self, period_index, length):
            self._parent = period_index
            super().__init__(length)

    return WeakPeriodEngine(weak_period_index, len(self))
``` 

By implementing this corrected version, we ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until the `PeriodEngine` requires it, resolving the issue of `NoneType` object error.
