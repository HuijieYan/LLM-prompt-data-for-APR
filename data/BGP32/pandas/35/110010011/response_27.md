### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the PeriodIndex object. However, the issue arises when the weak reference is passed to `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.
2. The error message indicates that `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, which suggests that the weak reference `period` might become `None`.
3. The cause of the bug is related to weak referencing and the dropping of weakly referenced PeriodIndex before intended, resulting in the PeriodEngine receiving a `None` object instead of the PeriodIndex.
4. To fix the bug, ensure that the weak reference `period` is correctly handled in the `_engine` function before passing it to `_engine_type`.

### Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to ensure that the weak reference `period` remains valid until it is used in `_engine_type`.

```python
    # Fixed version of the _engine function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(lambda: period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we use a lambda function to capture the weak reference `period` and ensure it remains valid until it is accessed inside the `_engine_type`. This modification ensures that the weak reference is correctly handled, preventing it from becoming `None` before it is used.

By implementing this fix, the bug related to weak referencing in the `_engine` function should be resolved, allowing the test to pass successfully.
