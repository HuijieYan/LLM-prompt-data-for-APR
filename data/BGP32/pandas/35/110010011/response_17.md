### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a cached readonly property within the `PeriodIndex` class.
2. The error occurs when trying to access the `view` attribute on a `NoneType` object in the `_do_monotonic_check` method.
3. The issue arises due to weak references not being handled correctly, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of a valid `PeriodIndex`.
   
### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` in the `_engine` property is maintained properly so that the `PeriodEngine` receives a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex`.

### Updated Bug-Free Function:

```python
# Fix for the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if period() is not None else self._engine_type(None, len(self))
```

By adding a check for `period() is not None` before returning the `_engine_type`, we ensure that even if the weak reference to `self` is lost, we provide a valid reference to `PeriodEngine`.

### Note:
In the corrected function, if the weak reference is lost and returns `None`, we pass `None` explicitly to the `PeriodEngine` constructor to handle this scenario.
