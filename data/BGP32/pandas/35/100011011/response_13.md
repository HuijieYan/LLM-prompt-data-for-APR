### Analysis
The `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error indicates that the `self._engine` attribute is returning None instead of the expected `PeriodEngine` object. This results in the subsequent issues when trying to access attributes or methods of `self._engine`.

### Explanation of the Bug
The `_engine` function utilizes `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is then passed to `_engine_type`. However, in this case, the weak reference mechanism is failing, and `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` is returning None instead of the expected `PeriodEngine` object. This leads to the AttributeError when attempting to access attributes or methods of the `PeriodEngine` object.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference mechanism works correctly and that the `PeriodEngine` object is properly instantiated and returned by the `_engine` function. One potential fix is to utilize `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref` to maintain a weak reference to `self` and ensure the correct return type.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref.proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By replacing `weakref.ref` with `weakref.proxy`, we ensure that a weak reference is correctly maintained, and the `PeriodEngine` object is returned as expected. This updated implementation should fix the bug and allow the failing test to pass.
