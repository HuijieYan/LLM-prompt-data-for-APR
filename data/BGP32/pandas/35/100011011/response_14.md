### Analyzing the buggy function and the failing test

1. The buggy function `_engine` has a decorator `@cache_readonly`, which suggests it's meant to cache the result of a computation and return the cached result on future calls.
   
2. The failing test is related to `idx2` created using `idx._get_level_values(level)`, where the test asserts `all(x.is_monotonic for x in idx2.levels)`. The error occurs when trying to access `is_monotonic` property, leading to an `AttributeError`.

### Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function

1. The issue seems to be related to the internal implementation of `PeriodEngine` or `_engine_type`.
   
2. The error message indicates that a `NoneType` object is being accessed for `view("i8")`, leading to the `AttributeError`.

### Explaining the cause of the bug

1. The `_engine` function should provide an instance of `PeriodEngine`, but due to weak referencing, the actual `PeriodIndex` instance is getting dropped or lost, resulting in a `NoneType` object being passed to `_engine_type`.

### Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug

1. Ensure that the weak reference to `self` in the `_engine` function is correctly managed to prevent the `PeriodIndex` instance from being lost while still avoiding reference cycles.
   
2. Make adjustments to how the weak reference is handled to ensure that the `PeriodIndex` instance is correctly passed to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The corrected `_engine` function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Correctly handle the weak reference to avoid losing the `PeriodIndex` instance
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By modifying the weak reference handling in the `_engine` function to immediately return the `PeriodIndex` instance, the bug should be resolved. This corrected version should help in passing the failing test related to `is_monotonic` checks.
