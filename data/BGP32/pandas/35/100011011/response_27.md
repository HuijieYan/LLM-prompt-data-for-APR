The buggy code is causing an issue where the `PeriodEngine` is receiving a `NoneType` object instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`, leading to an `AttributeError`. This is due to the weak reference `period` not being handled correctly.

To fix this bug, we need to properly handle the weak reference creation and retrieval in the `_engine` function. We should ensure that the weak reference is properly maintained and used when creating the `PeriodEngine`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `period()` is used to retrieve the original object referenced by the weak reference, so that `self._engine_type` receives the correct `PeriodIndex` object.

By implementing this fix, the `AttributeError` should be resolved, and the failing test related to weak referencing on `PeriodIndex` levels in `MultiIndex` should pass.
