### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is using weak referencing of `self` to avoid reference cycles when calling `_engine_type`. The error message `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` indicates that the weak reference is causing the `_engine` to return a `None` object leading to the attribute access error.

### Bug Cause:
The weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` is not correctly handling the reference to `self`, leading to `None` being returned from the weak reference when calling `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the weak reference must be properly managed to ensure it does not return `None` unexpectedly. Instead of directly using `self` in the weak reference, it's better to use `weakref.proxy(self)` to pass the weak reference to the `_engine_type` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use weakref proxy to avoid returning None
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` in place of `weakref.ref(self)`, we ensure that the weak reference is correctly handled, preventing the `None` return value and resolving the attribute access error.
