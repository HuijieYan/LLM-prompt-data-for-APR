### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the `AttributeError` is raised because the `PeriodEngine` is receiving a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`. This corresponds to the weak reference issue described in the GitHub problem where the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped prematurely.

The buggy function `_engine` creates a weak reference to `self` (the `PeriodIndex` object) and then tries to use that weak reference to create the `_engine_type`. However, due to how weak references work, the weakly referenced `period` is not being retained and therefore, `None` is received instead of the actual `PeriodIndex` object.

### Suggested Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly maintained until it is used to create the `_engine_type`. One approach to achieve this is by storing the weak reference externally in a separate variable to prevent it from being garbage collected prematurely.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weakref externally to prevent it from being garbage collected
    self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference externally in the `self._period_weakref`, we ensure that the weak reference is retained until it is used to create the `_engine_type`. This should resolve the weak reference issue and prevent the `AttributeError` from occurring.
