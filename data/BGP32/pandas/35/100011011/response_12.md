### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is intended to return an instance of `self._engine_type` with a weak reference to `self` passed as an argument. The error message indicates that a `NoneType` object is encountered while trying to access its attribute `view`.

The failing test involves creating a `MultiIndex` object with `PeriodIndex` levels and checking if they are monotonic. The bug is causing weak reference issues leading to the `NoneType` object error.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is introduced due to the weak reference, `period`, not correctly handling the reference to the `self` object. This results in the `_engine` function returning an incorrect or `NoneType` object, leading to attribute access errors in subsequent operations.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the weak reference mechanism needs to be corrected such that it accurately references the `self` object without any reference cycle issues.

### Code Fix:
```python
# The corrected version of the `_engine` function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Correct the weak reference usage
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By updating the weak reference to `period()` when calling, we can ensure that the correct `self` object is passed without any reference cycle problems. This change should resolve the weak reference issue and prevent the `NoneType` attribute access error.

After applying this fix, the corrected `_engine` function should behave as intended and pass the failing test as per the GitHub issue's expectation.
