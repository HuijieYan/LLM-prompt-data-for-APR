### Analyzing the buggy function and error message
The `_engine` function is utilizing weak references to avoid reference cycles. However, based on the error message, it seems that when trying to access the engine's view method, it encounters a NoneType object, resulting in the AttributeError. This suggests that the weak reference handling might be causing the issue.

### Identifying potential error locations
The issue seems to revolve around the management of weak references in the `_engine` function. Specifically, the way the weak reference is used might not be preserving the reference correctly.

### Cause of the bug
The weak reference to `self` created in the `_engine` function might not be maintained properly, causing it to be lost or referencing None instead of the expected `PeriodIndex` object. This leads to the AttributeError when trying to access the engine's view method.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly maintained throughout the `_engine` function. This involves verifying the creation and usage of the weak reference to prevent it from becoming None unexpectedly.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Properly utilize weak reference to preserve the reference to self
    _weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    if _weakref is not None and _weakref() is not None:  # Check if weak reference is still valid
        return self._engine_type(_weakref(), len(self))
    return None  # Return None if weak reference is None
```

By updating the `_engine` function to handle the weak reference more robustly, we should be able to preserve the reference to `self` correctly and avoid encountering the AttributeError.
