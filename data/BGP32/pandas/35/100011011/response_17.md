### Analysis:
The error message indicates an AttributeError `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`. This error occurs when trying to access the `view` attribute on a `NoneType` object. In the provided buggy function `_engine`, the return statement is trying to access the `self._engine_type` attribute with a weak reference to `self`. However, due to the weak reference, it seems that the reference is lost before the function is called, leading to `NoneType`.

### Bug Cause:
The weak reference is dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` object instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

### Fix Strategy:
Ensure that the weak reference to `self` is still valid when `_engine_type` is called. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference inside a variable and then accessing it only when needed.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Access the weak reference only when calling _engine_type
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By making this change, the weak reference to `self` is accessed at the moment the `_engine_type` function is called, maintaining the reference throughout the function call. This should resolve the issue and prevent the `NoneType` error from occurring.
