### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` uses `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is a `PeriodIndex` instance. The weak reference is passed to `_engine_type` to create an engine instance. In the failing test, when accessing the `is_monotonic` attribute of an index level (`x.is_monotonic for x in idx2.levels`), the `PeriodEngine` tries to access the weak reference created in the `_engine` function, but due to an issue with weak reference dropping prematurely, it results in `NoneType` object errors.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the weak reference created in the `_engine` function being prematurely dropped or not maintained correctly, leading to the `NoneType` object error when accessing attributes of the engine instance.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained correctly throughout the `_engine` function and that it is accessible when needed by the `PeriodEngine`. This could involve ensuring proper handling of the weak reference and potential modifications in the `_engine_type` instantiation.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)  # Create a weak reference to `self`
    engine = self._engine_type(period_weakref, len(self))  # Pass the weak reference to `_engine_type`
    return engine
```

By maintaining the weak reference throughout the `_engine` function and correctly passing it to the `_engine_type`, the bug should be fixed, and the error in the failing test should be resolved.
