### Analysis:
1. The `_engine` function is a `cache_readonly` method that returns an instance of `_engine_type` initialized with a weak reference to `self` (`PeriodIndex`). The issue seems to be related to the weak reference handling.
2. The error message points to an `AttributeError` in the `view` call on `NoneType`, indicating that the `PeriodEngine` is receiving `None` instead of a valid object causing the function to break.
3. The failed test provides a `PeriodIndex` input which is expected to return monotonic values but fails due to the weak reference handling issue with the `_engine` method. The weak reference drops before intended, leading to the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` value when accessed.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` (PeriodIndex) is correctly maintained and not dropped prematurely.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `_engine` method to properly handle the weak reference `period` to prevent premature dropping.
2. Ensure that the `_engine_type` method receives a valid reference to `self`.
3. Check and adjust the weak reference implementation to maintain a valid reference to `self` throughout the `_engine` function's lifetime.

### Corrected Version:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Passing a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference to `self` (PeriodIndex) will be maintained correctly throughout the `_engine` function's execution, ensuring that the `PeriodEngine` receives a valid reference and resolves the issue causing the `AttributeError`.
