### Analyzing the buggy function and the error message

The buggy function `_engine` is a cache readonly method that is intended to return an instance of the `_engine_type` class using a weak reference of `self` (PeriodIndex) to avoid creating a reference cycle. The error message indicates an AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute on a `NoneType` object, which suggests that the `_engine` method is not returning the correct instance.

### Identifying potential error locations

The potential error in the buggy function could be in the `_engine_type` instantiation using the weak reference of `self` (PeriodIndex). If the weak reference handling is incorrect, it might result in the `_engine` method returning a `None` object instead of the expected instance of `_engine_type`.

### Cause of the bug

The bug is likely caused by the weak reference handling in the `_engine` method, leading to the creation of a `None` object instead of the expected `_engine_type`. This behavior results in subsequent attribute errors when trying to access properties/methods on a `NoneType` object.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, the weak reference handling within the `_engine` method needs to be corrected to ensure that the correct instance of `_engine_type` is returned. This involves validating the weak reference creation and retrieval to prevent the creation of a `None` object.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)()  # Retrieve the weak reference
    if period:  # Check if weak reference is valid
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        return None  # Handle case where weak reference is None
```

By checking the validity of the weak reference before creating an instance of `_engine_type`, this corrected version of the function ensures that the `_engine` method returns the appropriate object and prevents the AttributeError described in the error message.
