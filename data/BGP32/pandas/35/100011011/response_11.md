### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` in the `period.py` file is using a weak reference to avoid a reference cycle. The issue arises when the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped earlier than intended, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

The failing test in `test_get_level_values_when_periods` checks for monotonicity in the levels of a `MultiIndex`. It accesses the `is_monotonic` property, which then tries to access `self._engine.is_monotonic_increasing`. The error occurs because `self._engine` is not functioning as expected and is a `NoneType`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by premature destruction of the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` instance before it is accessed by the `PeriodEngine`, resulting in it receiving `None` instead.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug:
To fix the bug, ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` instance remains valid until the `PeriodEngine` accesses it.

### Updated Function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By modifying the return statement to `return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))`, we ensure that the weak reference is converted to a strong reference through `period()`, preventing premature destruction of the `PeriodIndex` instance. This fix addresses the bug causing the `NoneType` error.
