### Correction

#### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs because the `weakref.ref` is used incorrectly to wrap `self`, causing a weak reference to be dropped prematurely. This results in `self._engine_type` receiving a NoneType where it expects a valid reference.

#### Correction Strategy:
1. Create a strong reference to `self` before passing it to `_engine_type`.
2. Adjust the return statement to use the strong reference instead of a weak reference.

#### Corrected Function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a strong reference to self
    period = self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By making these modifications, the bug should be resolved and the failing test should pass successfully.
