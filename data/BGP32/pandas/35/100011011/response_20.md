### Analysis
The error message indicates an AttributeError that occurs when the `_do_monotonic_check` method is trying to access an attribute `view` on a `NoneType` object. This error likely originates from the `_engine` method in the `pandas.core.indexes.period` module.

Looking at the runtime values, it is evident that the function `_engine` receives a `PeriodIndex` object as `self` parameter. The issue on GitHub mentioned a problem with weak referencing in `PeriodEngine`.

### Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by the weak referencing of the `self` object passed as an argument to the `_engine_type` constructor. When the weakref is created using `weakref.ref(self)`, the reference might be lost or not valid when accessed later in the `_engine` method.

### Proposed Fix
To address this issue, we can modify the `_engine` function to maintain a strong reference to `self` within its closure or directly pass `self` to `_engine_type`. By doing this, we ensure that the `self` object remains valid and does not become a `NoneType`.

Let's correct the function based on the analysis and suggested approach.

### Corrected Version
```python
# Corrected _engine function
# Fixed by removing the use of weakref
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By removing the weakref usage, we ensure that the `self` object remains a valid reference within the `_engine` function. This should resolve the AttributeError issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue related to weak referencing problems.
