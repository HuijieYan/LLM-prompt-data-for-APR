### Analysis:
The error message indicates an `AttributeError` on `NoneType` object. This error is related to a problem with weak referencing, as indicated by the GitHub issue involving weak references being dropped before intended.

### Identified issue:
1. The weak reference `period` being created is not being properly utilized in the `_engine` function, leading to potential loss of reference.
2. The `_engine_type` function is expecting a PeriodEngine instance to return, but due to the weak referencing issue, it might be receiving `None`.

### Cause of the bug:
The weak reference to `self` (PeriodIndex) is not being passed correctly to `_engine_type`, leading to a potential loss of reference when accessing it, hence the `NoneType` object error.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the weak reference `period` is properly utilized within the `_engine` function to maintain a valid reference to `self`.
2. Verify that the `_engine_type` function receives a valid reference by properly implementing the weak referencing mechanism.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
from weakref import ref

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = ref(self)  # Creating a weak reference to self
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))  # Passing the weak reference correctly
``` 

By creating a weak reference to `self` and passing it correctly to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the `self` reference is maintained without losing its validity within the `_engine` function. This should resolve the weak referencing issue and prevent the `NoneType` error.
