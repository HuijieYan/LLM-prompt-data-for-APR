### Analysis:
- The `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`, but the return statement is trying to access `self` after converting it to a weak reference.
- This causes the `self` object to be discarded prematurely, leading to the error message `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.

### Fix Strategy:
- Ensure that the `weakref.ref` is used properly to maintain the reference of `self` while accessing it.
- Modify the return statement to correctly utilize the weak reference.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
``` 

After making this change, the function should correctly handle the weak reference and avoid prematurely discarding the object. This fix should address the issue and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
