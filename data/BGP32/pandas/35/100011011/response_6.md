### Analysis:
The `_engine` function is intended to return a weakly referenced instance of the calling object. In this case, it should return a weak reference of the `PeriodIndex`. The error message suggests that the `PeriodEngine` is receiving a `NoneType` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex` instance.

The GitHub issue indicates that weak references are being dropped prematurely, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug lies in the weak reference creation and management within the `_engine` function. The premature dropping of the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` leads to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` object, causing the attribute error.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to correctly handle the weak reference creation and ensure that it maintains a reference to the `PeriodIndex` until it's no longer needed by the `PeriodEngine`. 

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)).view("i8")
```

### Updated Version Explanation:
In the corrected version, the weak reference `period` is correctly created to reference the calling object `self` (`PeriodIndex`) within the `_engine` function. By returning the `_engine_type` with the `period` reference and the length of `self`, we ensure that the weak reference remains valid until used by the `PeriodEngine`. Additionally, calling `.view("i8")` ensures that the correct view is returned from the `_engine`, resolving the attribute error issue.
