### Analysis:
The error message indicates an `AttributeError` specifically related to the `view` attribute with a `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`. This error likely stems from the use of weak referencing a `self` object in the `_engine` method, indicating that the weak reference might be causing the `_engine` to return a `NoneType` object.

### Bug Cause:
1. The `_engine` method tries to create a weak reference `period` to the `self` object, intending to avoid reference cycles.
2. However, weak references might not keep the object alive if no strong references exist, leading to the `period` variable being `None`.
3. Returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` with a potentially `None` `period` results in the subsequent AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` in the `_engine` method remains alive throughout the method's execution. This can be achieved by storing a strong reference to `self` before creating the weak reference.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store a strong reference to self to keep it alive throughout the method
    self_ref = self
    # Create a weakref pointing to the strong reference of self
    period = weakref.ref(self_ref)
    # Return the _engine_type with the weak reference
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By storing a strong reference to `self` before creating the weak reference, we ensure that the object will not be prematurely deallocated, resolving the `NoneType` object error and potential AttributeError. This correction should address the issue described in the GitHub report as well.
