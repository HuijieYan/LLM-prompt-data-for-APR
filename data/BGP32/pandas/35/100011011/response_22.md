### Analyzing the buggy function and error message

The buggy function `_engine(self)` is an instance method that is supposed to generate the `_engine_type` associated with a `PeriodIndex`. The error message indicates an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, which is triggered when the `view` method is called on an object that is `None`.

### Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function

The potential error location could be in how the weak reference `period` is being used to create the `_engine_type`.

### Explaining the cause of the bug

The bug is likely caused by the weak reference `period` not being properly used to create the `_engine_type`. This results in the `_engine` method returning `None`, leading to the AttributeError when trying to access the `view` method on this `None` object.

### Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is properly utilized to create the `_engine_type` without losing its reference. This will prevent the `_engine` method from returning `None`.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use the weak reference properly to avoid losing reference
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
    return engine
```

In this corrected version, we invoke the weak reference `period` with `()` to actually get the reference to the `self` object and then pass it to create the `_engine_type`. This modification ensures that the weak reference is properly utilized, preventing the return of `None`.
