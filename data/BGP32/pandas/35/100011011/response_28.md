### Analysis
The `_engine` function is trying to create a weak reference to the `self` object (in this case, a `PeriodIndex`), but it seems to be improperly handling the weak reference creation. The error message indicates that the `vgetter` function is returning a `NoneType`, which leads to the 'NoneType' object having no attribute 'view' error.

The GitHub issue description also confirms that weak referencing the `PeriodIndex` is leading to the issue.

### Error Cause
The weak reference to `self` (the `PeriodIndex`) might not be correctly stored in the period variable. This incorrect handling results in NoneType being returned by `_engine_type`. Consequently, it causes the 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view' error when trying to access the weakly-referenced `PeriodIndex` during the `vgetter().view("i8")` call.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly handled and passed to the `_engine_type` function. The weak reference has to be in a format that retains the reference during object creation in the `_engine` method.

### Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

This corrected version should properly create a weak reference to `self` (`PeriodIndex`) and pass it to `_engine_type`, resolving the weak reference issue and preventing the 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view' error.
