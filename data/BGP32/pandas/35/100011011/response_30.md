### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is a `PeriodIndex` instance. The issue arises because the weak reference is being passed to `self._engine_type`, likely expecting to retain weak reference semantics. However, since `weakref.ref(self)` returns a weak reference object, not the referred object itself, the `_engine_type` method receives `period` as a weak reference, which results in the error `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`. This error occurs when trying to access an attribute (`view`) on a `NoneType` object. This suggests that `self._engine_type` is not correctly handling the input `period`.

### Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to properly handle the weak reference object created by `weakref.ref(self)` and ensure that `self._engine_type` correctly interprets the weak reference to retrieve the original `self` object.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

In the corrected version, we are using `weakref.proxy(self)` to create a weak reference proxy instead of just a weak reference. This way, the `_engine_type` will receive the actual `self` object through the proxy and should avoid the `AttributeError` caused by passing a weak reference directly.

This fix should resolve the issue and allow the failing test related to weak references in `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` to pass successfully.
