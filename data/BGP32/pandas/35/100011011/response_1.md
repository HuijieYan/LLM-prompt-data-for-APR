The bug in the provided function `_engine` causes an issue related to weak references when manipulating `PeriodIndex` levels in a `MultiIndex` context. The issue is triggered by the `assert all(x.is_monotonic for x in idx2.levels)` statement, where the `is_monotonic` property is accessed through an engine that leads to a `NoneType` error due to incorrect weak references handling.

To fix this bug, the `_engine` function should properly handle weak references to avoid the `NoneType` error and maintain the necessary references for `PeriodEngine`. The corrected function should be able to correctly return the required engine type, ensuring the weak reference retains the intended `PeriodIndex` object.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By using `period()` instead of `period` in the return statement, the correct `PeriodIndex` object reference is obtained from the weak reference, preventing the `NoneType` error in subsequent operations like checking monotonicity. This fix aligns with the expected behavior outlined in the GitHub issue, resolving the weak reference handling problem.

Applying this correction should resolve the issue reported in the failing test and ensure the `is_monotonic` property can be correctly accessed without encountering `AttributeError` due to a `NoneType` object.
