### Analysis:
The error message highlights an `AttributeError` related to a `NoneType` object without the `view` attribute. This can be traced back to the `_engine` function where a weak reference is attempted to be created, but the weak reference is not maintained properly, leading to it being dropped prematurely.

The GitHub issue explains that weakly referencing `PeriodIndex` levels in a `MultiIndex` is not working as intended, which aligns with the error message received during testing.

### Bug Cause:
The `_engine` function creates a weak reference to `self`, but the weak reference needs to be kept alive during the engine's lifetime. However, in the current implementation, the weak reference is created but not stored in a place that would prevent it from being garbage collected.

### Fix Strategy:
To address this issue, we need to properly store the weak reference to prevent it from being destroyed before it is used, making sure it maintains its reference to `self`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    self._period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period, len(self))
```

By explicitly storing the weak reference in the instance (`self._period`), we ensure that the weak reference lives as long as the engine lives, preventing premature garbage collection and resolving the issue reported in GitHub.
