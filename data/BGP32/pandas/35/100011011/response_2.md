### Analysis:
1. The `_engine` function is being called to return the engine type for the PeriodIndex but is not properly handling the weak reference.
2. The error message indicates that a 'NoneType' object is being encountered when trying to access the `view` attribute in the `_do_monotonic_check` of the `IndexEngine`, which suggests that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is not being maintained correctly.
3. The `PeriodEngine` is encountering a 'NoneType' object because the weak reference is not being properly stored and accessed, resulting in an AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute of a NoneType object.
4. To fix this, we need to ensure that the weak reference is properly stored and accessed in the `_engine` function.

### Bug Fix:
```python
# The corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))()
```

By adding `()` at the end of `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))()`, we ensure that the engine is properly instantiated and not returning a weak reference object causing the issue. This fix should address the problem reported in the GitHub issue and allow the failing test to pass.
