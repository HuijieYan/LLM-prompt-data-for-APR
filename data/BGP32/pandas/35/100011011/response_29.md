### Analysis:
The error message indicates that there is an issue with the attribute `view` of a `NoneType` object. The context from the failing test suggests that the problem might be related to weak referencing of `PeriodIndex` causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

The function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is a `PeriodIndex`. However, the weak reference might not be preserved correctly, leading to the `None` value passed to `_engine_type`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the weak reference not being maintained properly, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` object instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained correctly and passed to `_engine_type` without being lost or turning into `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, the corrected version maintains a weak reference to `self` without risking it turning into `None`, resolving the bug and addressing the issue described on GitHub.
