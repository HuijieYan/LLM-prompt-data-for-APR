### Analysis
- The `_engine` function is a cache readonly function in the buggy file `pandas/core/indexes/period.py`.
- The error message indicates an `AttributeError` stating that a `NoneType` object has no attribute 'view'.
- Based on the runtime values, the input parameter `self` is a `PeriodIndex` object with values `['2019Q1', '2019Q2']`.
- The return value from the function is expected to be the result of `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.
- The GitHub issue describes a similar problem where weakref referencing is lost and the `PeriodEngine` receives `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

### Bug Cause
The issue occurs because `period = weakref.ref(self)` is creating a weak reference but not keeping it alive, leading to the reference being lost or returning `None` when accessed later in the `_engine_type()` function.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this issue, we need to modify the `_engine` function to store the weak reference properly and ensure it is still available when accessed by `_engine_type()`.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# Fixing the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store the weak reference to keep it alive
    if not hasattr(self, '_weak_period'):
        self._weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._weak_period, len(self))
``` 

By saving the weak reference in an attribute of `self`, we ensure that the reference is maintained and accessible when needed by `_engine_type()`. This modification should resolve the `AttributeError` and pass the failing test.
