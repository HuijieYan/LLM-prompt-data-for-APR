### Analysis:
1. The `_engine` function is trying to handle a weak reference of `self` to avoid reference cycles.
2. The error message indicates that the `AttributeError` occurs when trying to access the `view` attribute on a `NoneType` object in the `PeriodEngine` class.
3. The issue on GitHub details that weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped prematurely, leading to the `NoneType` error.
4. The premature dropping of the weak reference is causing the `NoneType` error when accessing the `view` attribute.
   
### Fix Strategy:
To resolve the issue:
- Ensure that the weak reference to `self` (`PeriodIndex`) is maintained until it is no longer needed.
- Check for the `None` object before accessing attributes to handle the error.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))

    if engine is None:
        return None
    
    return engine
``` 

With this corrected version, the weak reference to `self` remains intact until the engine is created. It also checks for `None` and returns `None` if the engine is `None`, avoiding the AttributeError.
