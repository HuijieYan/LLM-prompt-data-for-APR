### Analysis
The `_engine` method in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file is expected to create a weak reference to a `PeriodIndex` object and pass it to the `_engine_type` method. From the error message and the runtime values, it seems like the `_engine_type` method is not handling the weak reference correctly, resulting in an AttributeError when trying to access an attribute of a `NoneType`.

### Bug Cause
The current implementation of the `_engine` method does not properly handle the weak reference created using `weakref.ref(self)`. This leads to the `_engine_type` method receiving a `None` object instead of the `PeriodIndex` object, causing the AttributeError when trying to access an attribute. 

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is correctly handled within the `_engine` method. We should use the weak reference object to access the `PeriodIndex` object before passing it to the `_engine_type` method.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Obtain the weak reference object and access the original object from it
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    period = period_weakref()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This corrected version ensures that the weak reference is correctly resolved to access the original `PeriodIndex` object before passing it to the `_engine_type` method. This should resolve the AttributeError issue and allow the tests to pass successfully.
