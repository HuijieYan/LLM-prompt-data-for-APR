### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` function in the `PeriodIndex` class.
2. The function returns `self._engine_type` which is supposed to be initialized with `weakref.ref(self)` and `len(self)`.
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` instantiates a `PeriodIndex` with `Period` objects, then tries to get the level values and assert if they are monotonic.
4. The error message indicates an `AttributeError`, suggesting that the `_engine` is returning a `NoneType` object that is causing issues when trying to access the `view` attribute. This points to the fact that the `_engine_type` initialization might be returning `None`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_engine` function lies in the way the `_engine_type` is being initialized. It seems that the `_engine_type` is returning `None` instead of initializing properly with the weak reference and length of `self`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, the `_engine_type` initialization should be corrected to ensure that it properly initializes the engine with the weak reference and length. 

### Corrected Function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("_engine_type did not initialize properly")
    
    return engine
``` 

This corrected version adds a check after initializing the engine to ensure that it is not None and raises a ValueError if it is, indicating that the `_engine_type` did not initialize properly.
