### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `@cache_readonly` decorated function in the `PeriodIndex` class.
2. The bug is related to the `Weakref` implementation within the `_engine` function.
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `PeriodIndex` object and attempts to check if all the levels are monotonic, leading to the error message related to an attribute error within the `PeriodEngine`.
4. The bug seems to be related to the weak reference (`weakref.ref(self)`) inside the `_engine` function, which might be causing the `PeriodEngine` instance to be `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
We need to modify the way the weak reference is handled in the `_engine` function. Instead of directly assigning the weak reference as `period`, we should use it to access the referent object when needed.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def set_engine(self, engine):
        self._engine = weakref.ref(engine)
        
    @property
    def _engine(self):
        if not hasattr(self, '_engine_ref') or self._engine_ref() is None:
            self.set_engine(self._engine_type(self, len(self)))
        return self._engine_ref()

```

By setting the engine using `set_engine` method and accessing it through `_engine_ref`, we ensure that the weak reference does not become `None`. This corrected version should address the attribute error and pass the failing test.
