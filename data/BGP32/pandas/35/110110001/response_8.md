## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a method within the `PeriodIndex` class and is intended to create an instance of the `_engine_type` class using the weak reference of `self` (a PeriodIndex instance).
2. The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError raised when trying to access the `view` attribute on a `NoneType` object within the `_do_monotonic_check` method.
3. The bug is occurring because the weak reference is not being correctly accessed when trying to initialize `_engine_type`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is being properly utilized to instantiate the `_engine_type` class without resulting in a `NoneType` object.
5. Adjust the `_engine` method to correctly handle the weak reference and instantiation of `_engine_type`.

## Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` method within the `PeriodIndex` class:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```

This fix ensures that a weak reference to the `self` instance of `PeriodIndex` is being correctly passed to `_engine_type` during instantiation. This should resolve the `AttributeError` related to the `NoneType` object, allowing the test to pass successfully.
