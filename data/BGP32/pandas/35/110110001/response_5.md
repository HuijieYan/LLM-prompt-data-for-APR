### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is part of the `PeriodIndex` class in the `pandas.core.indexes.period` module.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is located in the `pandas.tests.indexes.multi.test_get_level_values` module.
3. The failing test attempts to check if all levels in the created `MultiIndex` are monotonic, but it fails due to an `AttributeError` related to the `PeriodEngine` being `NoneType`.
4. The bug is likely caused by the `_engine` method not correctly setting the period reference when creating an instance of `PeriodEngine`.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the reference to the period object is correctly set in the `_engine` method.

### Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))  # Corrected line to create an instance by calling weakref object
```

By modifying the `_engine` method to call the weak reference object `period` to create an instance of `self._engine_type`, we ensure that the reference is correctly set, fixing the bug that caused the `AttributeError`.

This fix should eliminate the `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error when running the failing test.
