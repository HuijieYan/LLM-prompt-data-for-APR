### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is part of the `PeriodIndex` class in the pandas library.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is trying to assert that the level values are monotonic in the `idx2` MultiIndex object.
3. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` which suggests that the function is trying to access an attribute of a `NoneType` object.
4. The bug seems to be related to the `_engine` function within `PeriodIndex` not being implemented correctly. The function is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, but the `period` reference seems to be incorrect and leading to a `NoneType` object error.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the `period = weakref.ref(self)` statement in the `_engine` function. It creates a weak reference to `self`, but it needs to dereference before usage. The use of `period` as a weak reference should be accessed correctly to prevent it from returning `None`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to properly access the weak reference `period` before using it to instantiate the `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Dereference the weak reference to get the actual object
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

In the corrected version, we include `()` after `weakref.ref(self)` to dereference the weak reference and obtain the actual object. This should prevent the `NoneType` error and allow the function to work correctly.
