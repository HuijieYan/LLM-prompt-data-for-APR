## Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class is causing an AttributeError due to returning `self._engine_type`, which is causing a cycle reference issue and returning `NoneType`.

## Bug Cause:
The `PeriodIndex._engine` function is creating a weak reference to `self` and then passing it to `_engine_type` constructor. However, due to a circular reference problem, it is returning `NoneType`, leading to the AttributeError during the test execution.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `weakref` reference is properly maintained and used within the `_engine` function to avoid the circular reference issue.

## Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class:

```python
# this is the corrected _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass the reference of self to _engine_type, not a weakref.
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

This modification eliminates the explicit use of `weakref` and directly passes a reference to `self` to the `_engine_type` constructor to avoid the circular reference issue.

With this corrected version, the test code provided should now pass without any AttributeErrors due to the circular reference problem.
