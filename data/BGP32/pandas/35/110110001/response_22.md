#### Analysis:
1. Buggy function: `_engine`
2. Related class: `PeriodIndex`
3. Error message: `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`
4. Test code: `test_get_level_values_when_periods` fails due to the error message mentioned above.

#### Potential Error Locations:
1. `weakref.ref(self)` usage in `_engine` function might be causing the issue.
2. Calling `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` might be returning a `NoneType` object causing the `AttributeError`.

#### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `_engine` function is that possibly the weak reference `period` is not holding a valid reference to `self`, which results in `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` returning a `NoneType` object. This leads to the `AttributeError` when trying to access the attribute `view` on the `NoneType` object.

#### Bug Fix Strategy:
Update the `_engine` function to ensure that the weak reference is properly holding a reference to `self`, resulting in the correct creation and return of the engine object.

#### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By making use of `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)` in the `_engine` function, we can maintain a reference to `self` without the risk of it becoming garbage collected. This should resolve the issue of `NoneType` object being returned and should help in passing the failing test.
