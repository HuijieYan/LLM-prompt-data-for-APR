### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is part of the `PeriodIndex` class in the pandas library.
2. The failing test attempts to create a `Period` and `PeriodIndex` object and then check if the level values are monotonic.
3. The error message points to an `AttributeError` in the `PeriodEngine` class related to a `NoneType` object missing the `view` attribute.
4. The `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` where `period` is a weakref. The issue likely arises from how the `self._engine_type` is dealing with the weak ref.
5. The bug can be fixed by ensuring that the weak ref is correctly handled by the `_engine_type` method.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `_engine` function to handle the weak ref correctly before passing it to `_engine_type`.
2. Ensure that the `_engine_type` class can unwrap or process the weak ref object correctly.
3. Check if the `self._engine_type` in `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` properly handles the weak reference and resolves it.

### Corrected Version of the `_engine` Function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we create a weak proxy reference that can be correctly resolved when passed to `_engine_type`. This should fix the bug and allow the failing test to pass.
