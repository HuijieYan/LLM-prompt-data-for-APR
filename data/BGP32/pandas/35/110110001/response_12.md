### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is part of the `PeriodIndex` class within the file `pandas/core/indexes/period.py`.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is located in the file `pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py`.
3. The error message indicates an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` which occurs while trying to access the `view` attribute on a `NoneType` object.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. The `_engine` function is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, where `period` is a `Weakref` object referencing `self`. There might be an issue with the `_engine_type` implementation in handling weak references or creating the engine object correctly.
2. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine` function creates and returns the correct engine object without any issues related to weak references.
   
### Bug Fix:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))()
```

By adding `()` after `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, we ensure that the engine object is correctly instantiated and returned. This change will help resolve the `NoneType` object attribute issue observed in the failing test.
