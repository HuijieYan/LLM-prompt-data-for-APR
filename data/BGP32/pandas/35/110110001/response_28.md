### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is part of the `PeriodIndex` class.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` object with `PeriodIndex` instances for testing purposes.
3. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` related to the 'NoneType' object not having the 'view' attribute. This error occurs when trying to access the `view("i8")` method on a `NoneType` object.
4. The bug seems to be related to the way the `_engine` function is handling the weak reference to self.

### Bug Cause:
1. The problematic line causing the bug is: `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))`
2. The weak reference `period` that is created with `weakref.ref(self)` does not maintain the reference to the actual object, leading to it being `None` when accessed.
3. This behavior causes the AttributeError when trying to access `view("i8")` on a `None` object.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` maintains a proper reference to the intended object. This can be accomplished by modifying the way the weak reference is created and accessed within the `_engine` function.

### Corrected Version of `_engine` Function:
```python
def _engine(self):
    def get_period_ref(self):
        return self

    period = weakref.ref(get_period_ref(self))
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By explicitly creating a reference to self within a function (`get_period_ref`), we ensure that a proper weak reference is being maintained for the `_engine` function. This should prevent the `NoneType` AttributeError issue.
