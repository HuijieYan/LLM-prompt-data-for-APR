### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a cached readonly function within the `PeriodIndex` class. It tries to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance and then instantiates an `_engine_type` object passing the weak reference and the length of `self`.
   
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `PeriodIndex` object with periods "2019Q1" and "2019Q2" and then constructs a `MultiIndex` from it. Later, it attempts to check if the levels of the resulting `idx2` are monotonic, triggering the error when calling `is_monotonic`.

### Error Cause:
The error occurs because the `_engine_type` implementation or initialization returns `None`, causing the `super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter().view("i8")` call to be made on a `NoneType` object, leading to an `AttributeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the implementation of `_engine_type` and ensure it properly returns an object.
2. Handle the case where `_engine_type` returns `None` within the `_engine` function, preventing the subsequent error.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        engine_instance = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
        return engine_instance if engine_instance is not None else NotImplemented
```

In the corrected version, the `_engine` function checks if the `_engine_type` instance is `None` and returns `NotImplemented` in that case to prevent any attribute access on a `NoneType` object. This ensures that the code can gracefully handle the case where the `_engine_type` initialization fails.
