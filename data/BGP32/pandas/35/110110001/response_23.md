## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a cached property that returns an instance of `self._engine_type` with a weak reference to the `self` object as an argument.
2. The failing test is testing the attribute `is_monotonic` of the levels of a `MultiIndex` object. The error occurs when trying to access the `is_monotonic` attribute due to an issue with the `_engine` property of `PeriodIndex`.

## Identified Bug:
The bug is in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The `_engine` function is returning `None`, leading to an AttributeError when trying to access the level values in the failing test.

## Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is that the weak reference to `self` in the `_engine` function is not being properly handled or utilized, resulting in `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` returning `None`, causing the AttributeError later in the failing test.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the weak reference created in the `_engine` function is being used correctly to prevent the garbage collection of the `self` instance.
2. Verify that the `_engine_type` constructor is returning the correct instance and not `None`.
3. Check for any issues related to the cached property or the handling of weak references that might cause the `_engine_type` to be `None`.

## Corrected Function:
```python
from keyword import kwonly_arg

# this is the corrected _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self, period_ref=kwonly_arg(1)):
    if period_ref is kwonly_arg(1):
        period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

In the corrected version of the `_engine` function, a default argument `period_ref` is introduced to handle weak references correctly. The function checks if `period_ref` is provided; if not, it creates a weak reference to `self`. Then, it returns the instance created by `_engine_type`. This modification ensures that the weak reference to `self` is maintained, preventing the issue of returning `None`.
