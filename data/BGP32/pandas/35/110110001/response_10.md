### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using a `cache_readonly` decorator which suggests that this function is meant to be cached and computed only once.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` containing periods and then checks if the levels of the resulting `MultiIndex` are monotonic.
3. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `is_monotonic` check, leading to an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute. This suggests that the `_engine` method in the `PeriodIndex` class is not working correctly.
4. The `_engine` method is returning a `PeriodEngine` instance created using the `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` call. This `PeriodEngine` instance is expected to provide the necessary functionality for the `PeriodIndex`, but the error suggests it is returning a `NoneType` instead.

### Potential Error:
The issue likely stems from the `_engine_type` method not returning a valid `PeriodEngine` instance, resulting in `NoneType` being returned and causing the subsequent `AttributeError`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `_engine` method returning a `NoneType` object instead of a valid `PeriodEngine` object.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the `_engine_type` method correctly creates and returns a valid `PeriodEngine` instance.
2. Check for any potential issues in the initialization or generation of the `PeriodEngine`.
3. Make sure that the `len(self)` argument is correctly providing the length needed for the `PeriodEngine`.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
        if engine is None:
            raise ValueError("Unable to create a valid PeriodEngine instance")
        return engine
```

By explicitly checking for `None` and raising an error if the `self._engine_type` method does not return a valid `PeriodEngine` instance, we can prevent the `AttributeError` caused by accessing attributes on a `NoneType`.
