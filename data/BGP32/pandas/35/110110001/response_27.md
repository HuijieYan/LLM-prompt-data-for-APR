### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` within the `PeriodIndex` class is using a weak reference to avoid creating a reference cycle, but it's not implemented correctly.
2. The bug arises from how `weakref.ref(self)` is used in the `_engine` function, leading to an `AttributeError`.
3. The error message indicates that `NoneType` does not have the attribute `view`, which suggests that the weak reference created is not working as intended, resulting in a `NoneType` being returned.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is correctly implemented and that the `period` variable is properly accessed within the `_engine` function.

### Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to avoid reference cycles
    try:
        period = weakref.ref(self)
    except TypeError:
        # In case weakref fails, fallback to normal reference
        period = self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By handling the `TypeError` exception that may occur when creating a weak reference, we ensure that even if weak reference creation fails, a normal reference is used, preventing the `NoneType` error.
