### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a cached readonly property of the `PeriodIndex` class.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` with `PeriodIndex` and tries to check if the levels are monotonic.
3. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` in the `_engine` property of the `PeriodIndex` class when attempting to access the `view` attribute.
4. The cause of the bug is that the `self._engine()` method in the `PeriodIndex` class is returning `None`, leading to the `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine` property of the `PeriodIndex` class returns a valid engine object instead of `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is None:
        raise ValueError("Failed to create engine")
    return engine
```

By explicitly checking if the `engine` object created by `_engine_type` is `None` and raising a `ValueError` in that case, we ensure that a valid engine object is returned by the `_engine` property. This will resolve the `AttributeError` caused by accessing attributes on a `NoneType` object.
