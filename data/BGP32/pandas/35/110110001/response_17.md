### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a cache-read-only property of the `PeriodIndex` class in the pandas library.
2. The failing test is related to when `PeriodIndex` instances are used in a `MultiIndex`.
3. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` related to `view("i8")` being called on a `NoneType` object.
4. The bug seems to be related to the `_engine` property implementation within the `PeriodIndex` class.

### Bug Cause:
The `_engine` property is returning `None` instead of the proper engine object. This is causing an `AttributeError` when trying to access attributes or methods on the `None` object.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine` property actually returns the correct engine object instead of `None`. This can be achieved by properly initializing the engine object within the `_engine` property function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from pandas.core.arrays.period import PeriodEngine


@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return PeriodEngine(period(), len(self))

```

By modifying the implementation of the `_engine` property to return an instance of `PeriodEngine` initialized with the weak reference of `self()`, we can fix the bug and ensure that the correct engine object is returned. This should resolve the `AttributeError` encountered in the failing test.
