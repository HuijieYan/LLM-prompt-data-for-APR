### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is part of the `PeriodIndex` class in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file.
2. The failing test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex` object.
3. The error occurs when trying to check if the levels of the newly created `MultiIndex` are monotonic using `x.is_monotonic`. The error suggests an issue related to an attribute 'view' of type 'NoneType'.
4. The bug is likely related to the `_engine` function not returning the correct object, based on the usage in the failing test.

### Bug Cause:
The issue arises from the `_engine` function returning `None`, resulting in an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute of the `self._engine` object.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix this bug, ensure that the `_engine` function returns a valid object of type `PeriodEngine`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    # corrected version of the function
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))()  # Corrected to instantiate the engine object
``` 

By instantiating the `_engine` object in the corrected version of the function, the bug should be fixed and the failing test should pass successfully.
