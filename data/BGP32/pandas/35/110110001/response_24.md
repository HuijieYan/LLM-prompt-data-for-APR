### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `@cache_readonly` function in the `PeriodIndex` class. It is used to create an instance of the engine type for handling internal operations.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `MultiIndex` with a `PeriodIndex` as one of its levels and then checks if the levels are monotonic.
3. The failing test attempts to access `is_monotonic` property on the levels of the `MultiIndex`, which internally tries to access `is_monotonic_increasing` and eventually `_engine`. The error message indicates that there is an issue with accessing the proper values.
4. The buggy function `_engine` is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. The issue is potentially with the instantiation of the engine type.
5. The error `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` suggests that the engine type `_engine_type` might not be instantiated correctly, resulting in `NoneType` instead of the expected engine type object.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, ensure that the `_engine_type` is properly instantiated and not returning `None`. Double-check the logic of how the engine type is being created within the `_engine` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_instance = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    if engine_instance is None:
        raise RuntimeError("Failed to create the engine instance.")
        
    return engine_instance
``` 

By ensuring that the `engine_instance` is not `None` after the instantiation, we prevent the issue of accessing attributes on a `NoneType` object. Now, the corrected `_engine` function will only return the engine instance if it is successfully created, potentially resolving the bug encountered in the failing test.
