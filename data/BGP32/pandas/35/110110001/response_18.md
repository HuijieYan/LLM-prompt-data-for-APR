### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `@cache_readonly` decorated method within the `PeriodIndex` class.
2. The failing test is trying to access the `is_monotonic` property which internally calls `is_monotonic_increasing` and then tries to access `self._engine.is_monotonic_increasing`, leading to the AttributeError.
3. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `view` attribute of a `NoneType` object, which points to the fact that `self._engine` is not properly instantiated within the `_engine` method.
4. The strategy to fix this bug would be to properly instantiate `self._engine` so that it is not `None` when accessed within other methods.

### Bug Fix:
To resolve the bug, we need to ensure that `_engine` method returns a properly instantiated instance of the engine type. Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))()
```

By invoking the `_engine_type(period, len(self))()` with parentheses at the end, we ensure that the engine instance is properly instantiated and returned, fixing the issue with accessing attributes of `NoneType` object.

After making this change, re-run the failing test, and it should pass without raising any AttributeError.
