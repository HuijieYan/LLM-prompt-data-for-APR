### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `@cache_readonly` function inside the `PeriodIndex` class.
2. The test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is failing due to an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.
3. The error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` object in the `_engine` method is returning a `NoneType`.
4. This issue could be related to how the weak reference `period` is created and passed to `_engine_type`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Since the error seems to be related to the creation of the weak reference `period`, the bug can be fixed by ensuring that the weak reference is stored correctly so that the `PeriodEngine` object can access it without any NoneType issues.
- We can handle the weak reference correctly in the `_engine` method to prevent it from being garbage collected prematurely.

### Bug Fix:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
    return engine
```

In this modification, we store the weak reference in a variable `period_ref` and use that to create the `PeriodEngine` object. This should prevent the weak reference from being garbage collected too early, causing the `NoneType` issue.
