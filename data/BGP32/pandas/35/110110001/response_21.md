The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is causing an `AttributeError` when the test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods` tries to assert the monotonicity of the levels in a `MultiIndex`. The error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` object is returning a `NoneType` object when trying to access the `view` attribute.

The cause of this bug is likely due to an issue with creating the weak reference and passing it to the `_engine_type` constructor. The weak reference `period` is being created incorrectly in the `_engine` method.

To fix this bug, we need to revise how the weak reference is created and passed to the `_engine_type` constructor. We need to ensure that the weak reference is created correctly and that it is actually referencing the `self` instance of the `PeriodIndex` class.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `period()` is called to get the actual referenced object from the weak reference before passing it to the `_engine_type` constructor. This should resolve the issue with the `AttributeError` and ensure that the weak reference is correctly pointing to the `PeriodIndex` instance.
