### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is using a cached property `@cache_readonly`.
2. The function `_engine` creates a weak reference to `self` and then returns the result of calling `_engine_type` with `period` and `len(self)` as arguments.
3. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` uses a `MultiIndex` object created from a `PeriodIndex`.
4. The failing assert statement `assert all(x.is_monotonic for x in idx2.levels)` checks if all levels in `idx2` are monotonic.
5. The failure occurs when the `is_monotonic` check accesses `self._engine`, which leads to an AttributeError due to the weakness of the reference.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the weak reference implementation in the `_engine` function. When trying to access the `_engine` property of `self` in the test, the weak reference returns `None`, causing the subsequent `AttributeError` when attempting to call `view("i8") on the `None` object.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the `_engine` function to return a stable reference to the engine type, ensuring that it does not create a weak reference but maintains a strong reference.
- By avoiding weak references, the `AttributeError` related to the weak reference will be prevented.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Return a strong reference to self
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
By returning `self` directly to `_engine_type`, we provide a strong reference to `self` instead of a weak reference, ensuring that the engine behavior is stable and can be accessed without any issues. This correction should resolve the `AttributeError` encountered in the failing test.
