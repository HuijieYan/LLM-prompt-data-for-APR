### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `@cache_readonly` function defined within the `PeriodIndex` class in the file `pandas/core/indexes/period.py`.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` in the file `pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py` uses `PeriodIndex` and fails at the assertion that checks if all levels are monotonic.
3. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` related to the `NoneType` object not having the attribute `view`.
4. The bug seems to occur when trying to access the `.view("i8")` method on a `NoneType` object since the `_engine` function returns a `weakref.ref` object instead of the actual engine object.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function in such a way that it returns the actual engine object instead of a weak reference to it. This can be achieved by modifying how the engine is instantiated and returned within the `_engine` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # Simply return the _engine_type with 'self' as the parameter
        return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By directly passing `self` to the `_engine_type` constructor, we ensure that the actual engine object is returned and resolved properly, fixing the `NoneType` AttributeError issue encountered in the failing test.
