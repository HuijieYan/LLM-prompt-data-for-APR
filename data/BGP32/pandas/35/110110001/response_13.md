### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is a cached readonly property that returns an instance of `self._engine_type`. The `_engine_type` initialization seems to be receiving a weak reference to the `self` object, which is done incorrectly in the buggy function. This incorrect weak reference leads to an AttributeError when trying to access an attribute of a `NoneType` object.

### Potential Error Location:
The issue is likely in the line `period = weakref.ref(self)` inside the `_engine` function where a weak reference is created incorrectly.

### Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is that the weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` is not being used correctly in the `_engine_type` initialization, which results in an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `view` attribute of a `NoneType` object.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
The correct way to create a weak reference is by directly passing `self` as an argument, not assigning it to a local variable. This way, the reference is maintained while the `self` object is in scope. 

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
``` 

By making this change, the `weakref.ref(self)` is used correctly, which should resolve the `AttributeError` issue encountered in the failing test.
