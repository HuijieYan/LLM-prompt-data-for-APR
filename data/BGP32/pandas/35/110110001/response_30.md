### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is part of the `PeriodIndex` class in the file `pandas/core/indexes/period.py`.
2. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is located in the file `pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py`.
3. The error occurs when trying to check if the levels of the `idx2` MultiIndex object are monotonic.
4. The error message indicates an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`.

### Bug Cause:
The `_engine` function is intended to return an instance of `_engine_type` with a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object. The bug occurs because the weak reference is set incorrectly, resulting in a `NoneType` error when trying to access the view attribute.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is properly set to the `PeriodIndex` object to avoid the NoneType error.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))  # Change weakref call to weakref.callable
```

In the corrected version, `period()` is called to retrieve the `PeriodIndex` object from the weak reference before passing it to `_engine_type`. This change ensures that the weak reference is properly resolved and the `AttributeError` is avoided.
