### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_engine` is a `@cache_readonly` decorator in the `PeriodIndex` class.
2. The test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods` creates a `PeriodIndex` from `Period` objects and tries to assert if the resulting levels are monotonic.
3. The error message indicates an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` which is raised when trying to access the `view` attribute on a `NoneType` object.
4. The bug appears to be related to the way `self._engine_type` is being initialized in the `_engine` function.
   
### Bug Cause:
The `_engine` function is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. The issue arises when `_engine_type` fails to properly initialize, resulting in a `None` being returned, leading to the `AttributeError.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `self._engine_type` initializes correctly, so it doesn't return `None`. One approach is to wrap the instantiation of `_engine_type` in a `try-except` block to catch any potential errors during initialization.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    try:
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
        if engine is None:
            raise ValueError("Engine initialization failed")
        return engine
    except Exception as e:
        raise ValueError(f"Error initializing engine: {e}")
``` 

By implementing this change, we catch any errors that may occur during the initialization of `_engine_type` and ensure that a `None` object is not returned, preventing the `AttributeError` seen in the failing test.
