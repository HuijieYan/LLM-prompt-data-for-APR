## Analysis
The `_engine` function is supposed to return the engine type of the period index based on the input self. However, the issue lies in how the weak reference to `self` is being passed to `_engine_type`. The weak reference object is not being dereferenced before being passed as an argument.

## Bug Explanation
The bug in the current implementation is that `weakref.ref(self)` creates a weak reference object to `self`, but this object needs to be dereferenced to get the actual object it references before passing it to `_engine_type`. As a result, `_engine_type` is receiving a weak reference object instead of the actual `self` object.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to dereference the weak reference object before passing it to `_engine_type` by using the `()` operator to call the reference. This will ensure that the actual `self` object is passed to the `_engine_type` function.

## Code Fix
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
``` 

By dereferencing the weak reference object `period` before passing it to `_engine_type`, the bug is fixed and the function should now return the correct engine type for the given input parameters.
