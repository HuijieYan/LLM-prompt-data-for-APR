## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is a `cache_readonly` method that is intended to return an instance of `_engine_type` constructed using a weak reference to the `self` object. However, the bug lies in the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref(self)` which doesn't correctly create a weak reference to `self`.

## Potential Error
The potential error lies in the line:
```python
period = weakref.ref(self)
```
Instead of correctly creating a weak reference to `self`, it assigns the weak reference instance to `period`.

## Bug Explanation
The bug causes `period` to hold the weak reference instance itself, rather than the weak reference to `self`. This means that when `_engine_type` is called with `period`, it actually receives the weak reference instance instead of `self`. This can cause issues later when `self` is expected instead of a weak reference.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to correctly create a weak reference to `self` and pass that weak reference to `_engine_type`. This can be done by calling `weakref.ref(self)` directly when passing to `_engine_type`.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```
