## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is intended to return an engine object based on the input parameters `self` and `len(self)`. However, there are several issues in the implementation:
1. The use of `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self` is unnecessary and incorrect.
2. It does not correctly create the engine object based on the input parameters.

## Bug
The bug in the original `_engine` function lies in the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`, which is unnecessary for this context. Additionally, the function fails to properly construct and return the engine object based on the input parameters. 

## Fix
To fix the bug, we should remove the unnecessary weak reference creation with `weakref.ref(self)` and properly create the engine object using the correct type and length.

## Corrected code
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self._values, len(self))
``` 

This corrected code simplifies the function by directly using `self._values` and `len(self)` to construct the engine object as intended.
