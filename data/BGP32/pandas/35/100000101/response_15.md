The bug in the provided function arises from creating a weak reference to `self` incorrectly. The weak reference `period` should be established for the instance of the object `self`, not the class itself. Additionally, the `_engine_type` function is called with the weak reference `period`, but it is likely expecting the actual object reference.

To fix this bug, we need to update the function to correctly create a weak reference to the instance of the object and pass the actual object reference to the `_engine_type` function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_weakref(), len(self))
```

This updated version of the function should solve the issue by correctly handling the reference to the object `self` and passing the actual object reference to the `_engine_type` function.
