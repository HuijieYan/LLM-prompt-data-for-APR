The bug in the function `_engine` lies in the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref(self)`. The `weakref.ref` function is used to create a weak reference to the object passed to it, allowing the referenced object to be garbage collected when there are no strong references to it. However, in this case, the `period` variable is not being dereferenced correctly.

To fix the bug, we should use `period()` to dereference the weak reference and retrieve the original object before passing it to the `_engine_type` constructor.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.ref(self)()`, we extract the original object from the weak reference and pass it to the `_engine_type` constructor, resolving the bug and ensuring that the function works correctly with the expected input and output values.
