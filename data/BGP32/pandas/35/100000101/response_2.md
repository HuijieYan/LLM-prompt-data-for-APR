## Analysis
The function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref()` incorrectly by passing `self` directly to create a weak reference. This is causing a potential reference cycle issue and can lead to memory leaks. 

## Bug Explanation
The bug is in the line:
```python
period = weakref.ref(self)
```
By directly passing `self` to `weakref.ref()` without creating a weak reference to `self`, the function is not properly handling circular references. This can lead to memory leaks and incorrect behavior in the presence of cyclic references.

## Fix
To fix this bug, we need to create a weak reference to `self` by calling `weakref.ref()` on `self` like so:
```python
period = weakref.ref(self)
```

## The corrected version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
