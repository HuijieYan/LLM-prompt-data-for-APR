## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` incorrectly. `weakref.ref` returns a weak reference object, not the actual object itself. The intention behind using `weakref` is to pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type` to avoid creating a reference cycle. However, the function is not correctly passing the weak reference object to `_engine_type`.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by using `weakref.ref(self)` directly as a parameter to `_engine_type`, instead of dereferencing it first to get the actual object.

## Fix
To fix this bug, we need to dereference the weak reference object created using `weakref.ref(self)`. We can achieve this by calling the `weakref` object as a function, which will return the actual object it is referencing.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
