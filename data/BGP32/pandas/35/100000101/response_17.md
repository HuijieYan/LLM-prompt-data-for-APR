## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is supposed to return an instance of the `_engine_type` class initialized with a weak reference to the `self` object and the length of the `self` object. However, the issue lies in how the weak reference is being created. The `weakref.ref()` function is used to create a weak reference to an object, but it returns a weak reference object rather than the actual object. Therefore, the instantiation of the `_engine_type` class with `period` as an argument will not provide the actual `self` object as intended.

## Bug
The bug in the function is caused by incorrectly using `weakref.ref(self)` instead of directly passing `self` to `_engine_type`, resulting in a weak reference object being passed.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we need to directly pass `self` to `_engine_type` without creating a weak reference object.

## Corrected version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```
