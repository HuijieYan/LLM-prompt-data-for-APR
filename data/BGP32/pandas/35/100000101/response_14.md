## Analysis
The bug seems to be related to the creation of a weak reference object of the `self` instance in the `_engine` function. The code attempts to create a weak reference object using `weakref.ref(self)`, but it should create the weak reference to the object itself rather than its values.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by creating a weak reference object to `self._values` instead of the `self` instance in the `_engine` function. This causes the weak reference object to be created with incorrect information.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should create a weak reference object of the `self` instance instead of `self._values`. This will ensure that the weak reference object captures the correct reference to the `self` instance.

## Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
