## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is a cached function that should return the engine type associated with the PeriodIndex object. The issue lies with how the weak reference `period` is created. The current implementation is creating a weak reference to `self` as `period = weakref.ref(self)`, which is not correct. This results in a weak reference to the PeriodIndex object being passed to the `_engine_type` constructor, causing unexpected behavior.

## Bug Explanation
When `period = weakref.ref(self)` is called with `self` being a PeriodIndex object, it creates a weak reference to the PeriodIndex object itself rather than a weak reference to the `_engine` function. As a result, the weak reference being passed to `_engine_type` is incorrect, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we need to create a weak reference to the `_engine` function itself. We can achieve this by using `weakref.ref(self.__class__._engine)`, where `self.__class__._engine` refers to the `_engine` function of the PeriodIndex class.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of the _engine function to _engine_type.
    engine_ref = weakref.ref(self.__class__._engine)
    return self._engine_type(engine_ref, len(self))
```

With this correction, the function will correctly create a weak reference to the `_engine` function and pass it to the `_engine_type` constructor. This will avoid the reference cycle issue and provide the expected behavior.
