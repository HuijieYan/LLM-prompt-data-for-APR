## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` defines a weak reference `period` to `self` and then calls `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` to create an engine object. However, the issue lies in the way the weak reference is created. The weak reference should point to the object `self` itself, not to the method `self`.

## Bug Explanation
In the buggy code, the line `period = weakref.ref(self)` creates a weak reference to the method `self`. This will cause an issue when trying to use `period` in `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` because `period` is actually referencing the method instead of the `self` object.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we should create a weak reference to the object `self`, not the method. We can achieve this by directly passing `self` into the `weakref.ref()` function.

## Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to the object 'self'
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
