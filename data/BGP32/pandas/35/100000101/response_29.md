The bug in the provided function `_engine` is that it is creating a weak reference of the `self` object using `weakref.ref`, but not actually dereferencing it when passing it to `_engine_type`.

### Bug Explanation:
The `weakref.ref` function returns a weak reference object pointing to the original object. It does not directly provide access to the original object's attributes. In the provided buggy function, the `period` variable is not dereferenced, causing the `_engine_type` function to operate on the weak reference itself, leading to unexpected behavior and errors.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to dereference the weak reference object `period` before passing it to `_engine_type`. This can be done by calling the weak reference object `period` like a function to get the original object it is referring to.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By calling the `weakref.ref(self)()` function, we are dereferencing the weak reference `period` and passing the original object to the `_engine_type` function. This should resolve the bug and produce the expected output.
