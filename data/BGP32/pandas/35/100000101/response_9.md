The bug in the given function is that it is using `weakref.ref()` incorrectly. The `weakref.ref()` function does not create a weak reference to the object directly, but rather it creates a callable object that returns a weak reference to the object when called. So, instead of passing `period`, which is a callable object created by `weakref.ref()`, we should pass `period()` to get the weak reference to `self`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to call `period()` before passing it to `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
