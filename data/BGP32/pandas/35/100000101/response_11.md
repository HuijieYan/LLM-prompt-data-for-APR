## Analysis
In the buggy function `_engine`, the code is trying to create a weak reference to `self` (a period index) and pass it to `_engine_type` along with the length of the period index. The intention is to avoid reference cycles that could cause memory leaks. However, the bug lies in the way the weak reference is being created.

### Bug:
The bug is in the line:
```python
period = weakref.ref(self)
```
The correct way to create a weak reference is by calling `weakref.ref` directly on the object, not assigning the result to a variable `period`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, remove the variable `period` and directly create the weak reference to `self`.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    return self._engine_type(weakref.ref(self), len(self))
```
