## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `self` object, which is an instance of the `PeriodIndex` class. The intention seems to be to avoid a reference cycle by passing a weak reference to the `_engine_type` constructor.

The potential error in the function is that instead of creating a weak reference to the object itself, it is creating a weak reference to the `self` string representation (`str` type) of the object. Therefore, when the `_engine_type` constructor is called with this weak reference, it may not work as expected.

## Bug Explanation
The bug is caused by passing a weak reference to the string representation of `self` rather than to the actual `self` object. As a result, when `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` is called, the `period` variable is not the expected weak reference to the `self` object, leading to incorrect behavior or errors.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to create a weak reference to the `self` object itself, not to its string representation. We can achieve this by directly passing `self` to `weakref.ref`.

## Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, `self` is passed directly to `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object itself. This ensures that the weak reference is to the correct object, satisfying the expected input/output values.
