## Analysis and Explanation
In the given buggy function `_engine`, the code attempts to use `weakref.ref` on `self` to avoid creating a reference cycle. However, there is an issue with the usage of `weakref.ref` in this context. The `weakref.ref` function creates a weak reference object, not a callable function like a bound method.

To correct this bug, we need to modify the code to store a weak reference to `self` and then extract the actual object when needed. We can achieve this by modifying the code to use `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`.

## Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(period))
```

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, we ensure that the `period` object maintains a reference to `self` without creating a weak reference object. This modification should resolve the bug and produce the expected output values.
