To fix the bug in the provided function, we need to update the way the weak reference to `self` is being created. The issue lies in the usage of `weakref.ref(self)`, which creates a weak reference to the entire object `self`, including its attributes. This can lead to unexpected behavior where the weak reference is holding onto a reference to `self` longer than necessary.

To address this, we should create a weak reference to `self._values` instead, which is the specific attribute needed for the `_engine_type` method.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self._values to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self._values)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By creating a weak reference to `self._values` instead of `self`, we ensure that only the necessary attribute is being referenced weakly, which can help avoid potential reference cycle issues. This correction should maintain the expected behavior for all test cases provided.
