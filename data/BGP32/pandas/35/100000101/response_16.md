Based on the given buggy function and the expected values and types of variables during the failing test execution, the bug seems to be related to the usage of a weak reference in creating the `period` variable. The weak reference `weakref.ref(self)` may not be correctly referencing the object `self` as intended.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to directly pass `self` to `_engine_type` without using a weak reference.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
``` 

This corrected version directly passes `self` to `_engine_type` without creating a weak reference. This should resolve the issue and return the expected output values and types for all the provided test cases.
