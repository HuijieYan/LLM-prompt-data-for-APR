## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using a weak reference to the `self` parameter to avoid creating a reference cycle. However, the bug lies in how the weak reference is being created. The `weakref.ref()` function is supposed to create a weak reference to an object, but in this case, it is incorrectly used. It should be used as `weakref.ref(self)()`, as the function `self._engine_type()` requires the actual object, not the weak reference to it.

## Bug Fix Strategy
- Modify the line where the weak reference is created to ensure that the actual object is passed to the `_engine_type` function.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
