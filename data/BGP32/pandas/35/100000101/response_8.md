## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` on the `self` object to pass a weak reference to `_engine_type`. However, the issue lies with how `weakref.ref` is being used. By calling `weakref.ref(self)`, a weak reference object is created but not explicitly dereferenced to access the actual object. This means that `period` is holding the weak reference object, not the actual `self` object. This leads to an incorrect object being passed to `_engine_type`.

## Fix
To fix this issue, we need to dereference the weak reference object to access the actual `self` object before passing it to `_engine_type`. An alternative approach is to directly pass `self` to `_engine_type` without using `weakref`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self._values))
``` 

By directly passing `self` to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the correct object is being passed.
