Based on the buggy function provided, the main issue seems to be that the weakref creation is not correctly capturing a reference to the `self` object, which can lead to unexpected behavior. 

To fix this bug, we need to properly create a weak reference to the `self` object by using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref.proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we ensure that the `_engine` function will have a weak reference to the `self` object without breaking the reference cycle. This fix should address the issue and satisfy the expected input/output values provided.
