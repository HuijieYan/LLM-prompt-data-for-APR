To fix the buggy function, I would suggest modifying the `_engine` function to correctly pass a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# This is the corrected version of the function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

Explanation:
- In the original buggy function, `weakref.ref(self)` was passing a weak reference of `self` to `_engine_type`, but it should actually pass the result of `weakref.ref(self)()` which is the actual object being referenced by the weak reference.
- By calling `weakref.ref(self)()` we are obtaining the object that the weak reference is pointing to, which is required for the `_engine_type` function to work correctly.

With this correction, the expected output values for the provided test case should now be satisfied.
