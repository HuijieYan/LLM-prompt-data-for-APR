### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is trying to create a weak reference to `self` and then pass it to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`. However, the issue lies in how the weak reference is being created. It is incorrectly created as `weakref.ref(self)` which should be `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to create the weak reference correctly to avoid a reference cycle.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
