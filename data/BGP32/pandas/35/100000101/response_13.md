The bug in the provided function `_engine` is related to the usage of `weakref.ref` incorrectly. The function tries to create a weak reference to `self`, but it should create a weak reference to the object `period` instead.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly create a weak reference to the `period` object and pass it to `_engine_type` along with the length of `self`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of period object to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```

By making this change, we correctly create a weak reference to the `period` object and pass it along with the length of `self._values` to `_engine_type`.

This correction will ensure that the function `_engine` operates as intended, creating the engine object with the correct inputs.
