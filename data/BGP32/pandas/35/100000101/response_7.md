The bug in the provided function lies in how the weak reference to `self` is being created and passed to `_engine_type`. The `weakref.ref()` function is used incorrectly, as it should be called with `self` directly to create a weak reference to the object.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `_engine` function to correctly create a weak reference to `self` and pass it to `_engine_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` instead of `weakref.ref(self)` directly in the return statement, we obtain the actual object referred to by the weak reference and pass it to `_engine_type`.

This correction ensures that the function correctly uses a weak reference to `self` as intended, thereby fixing the bug present in the original function.
