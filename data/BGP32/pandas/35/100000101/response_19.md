## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` incorrectly to create a weak reference to `self`. `weakref.ref` returns a weak reference object, not the actual object itself. This weak reference object needs to be dereferenced using `.()` to obtain the actual object.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `period` variable is assigned the weak reference object instead of the actual `self`. When the `_engine_type` function is called with `period` as an argument, it receives the weak reference object instead of the actual `self` object.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to dereference the weak reference object `period` to obtain the actual `self` object before passing it to the `_engine_type` function.

## Corrected Version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
