To fix the bug in the given function, we need to make sure that we pass a weak reference object of `self` to the `_engine_type` constructor instead of just a direct reference to `self`.

The cause of the bug in the original code is that the `weakref.ref()` function is used incorrectly. `weakref.ref()` returns a weak reference object, and the correct way to retrieve the actual object from the weak reference is by using the `.()deref` method on the weak reference object.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly use the weak reference object.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the corrected function, we call the `period()` function on the weak reference object `period` to obtain the actual object referred to by the weak reference. This ensures that the weak reference is properly dereferenced, and the correct object is passed to the `_engine_type` constructor.
