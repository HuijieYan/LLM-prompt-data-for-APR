The bug in the provided function `_engine` is the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference. The function should be returning a weak reference object, not the result of calling `weakref.ref()` directly.

### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_engine` is supposed to create a weak reference to the `self` object (which is an instance of `PeriodIndex`) and pass it to the `_engine_type` method. However, the function directly returns the result of calling `weakref.ref(self)`, which creates a weak reference object and does not achieve the intended purpose.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly create a weak reference object by calling `weakref.ref(self)` and then returning the created weak reference object. This way, the `_engine` function will return a weak reference to the `self` object as required.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return period
```

By making this change, the `_engine` function will create and return a weak reference object for the `self` object, ensuring that there are no reference cycles. This corrected version should satisfy the expected input/output values for the function.
