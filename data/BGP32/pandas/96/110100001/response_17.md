### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is supposed to adjust a given datetime object based on business hour offsets.
2. The bug seems to be related to the calculation and adjustment of business hours in the function.
3. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is testing the behavior of creating a date range with custom business hours and holidays. The bug causes the function to produce incorrect results, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual output.
4. To fix the bug, the calculation and adjustment logic of business hours in the `apply` function need to be carefully reviewed and corrected.

### Bug Fix:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessMixin
from pandas.tseries.offsets import ApplyTypeError
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                else:
                    bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                
                if bhour_remain < bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    if n >= 0:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                    else:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

```

By making the adjustments shown in the fixed function above, the bug in the `apply` function should be resolved and the failing test should pass successfully.
