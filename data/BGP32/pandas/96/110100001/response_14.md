### Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class and is used to adjust datetime objects based on business hours. The bug seems to be causing issues when adjusting datetime objects with negative business hours.

### Bug Explanation
The bug seems to be related to the logic for adjusting datetime objects with negative business hours. It is failing to correctly handle cases where the previous opening time needs to be adjusted. This leads to incorrect adjustments and causes the failing test case to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting datetime objects with negative business hours needs to be reviewed and amended to correctly handle the cases where the previous opening time needs to be adjusted.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = other - skip_bd
            else:
                other = self._prev_opening_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) + skip_bd
        
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = (
                    self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other)) - other
                )
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(self._next_opening_time(other) + timedelta(seconds=1))
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if (
                    bhour_remain > bhour
                    or bhour_remain == bhour
                    and nanosecond != 0
                ):
                    other -= bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other - timedelta(seconds=1))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version adjusts datetime objects with negative business hours correctly, which should resolve the issue with the failing test case.
