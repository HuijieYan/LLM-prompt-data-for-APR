### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is supposed to adjust the input `datetime` object based on the business hours defined by the `BusinessHourMixin` class.
2. The bug seems to be related to the handling of negative values of `n` (number of business hours to adjust).
3. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is failing because the adjusted dates are incorrect when `n` is negative.

### Bug Explanation:
- When `n` is negative, the logic for adjusting the business hours is incorrect. It does not handle the negative case properly, leading to incorrect adjustments and results.

### Fix Strategy:
- We need to correct the logic for adjusting business hours when `n` is negative in the `apply` function. Properly handle the adjustment of business hours and the movement to the next or previous business day.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() not in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Applying this corrected version should address the bug and make the failing test pass.
