## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is intended to adjust a given datetime object based on business hours defined by the class.
2. The function attempts to handle cases where the adjustment results in moving to the next or previous business day and adjusting remaining business hours within the same day.
3. The bug seems to be related to the handling of negative values of `n` (number of business hours to adjust) and the calculation of the remaining business hours to adjust.
4. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` checks the behavior of custom business hours with a specified start time and holidays included.
5. The test fails due to incorrect adjustments made in the `apply` function that result in unexpected datetime values.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect handling of negative `n` values and the corresponding calculation of remaining business hours to adjust. This leads to incorrect adjustments and output datetime values.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to revisit the logic for adjusting datetime objects based on business hours when `n` is negative. Additionally, we should ensure that the remaining business hours are correctly calculated and adjusted within the appropriate business time intervals.

## Corrected Version of the `apply` function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

                other.year,
                other.month,

        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
            
    def _adjust_positive_n(self, other, bd, r):
        skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)

            prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)

                self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            )
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain

        return other
    
    def _adjust_negative_n(self, other, bd, r, nanosecond):
        skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
        
        if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):

            bhour = other - self._next_opening_time(other)
            if bhour_remain < bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                other -= bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other - bhour + timedelta(seconds=1)))
        
        return other
```

By implementing the corrected version of the `apply` function and adjusting the logic for negative `n` values, the bug should be fixed, and the function should pass the failing test related to custom business hours adjustments.
