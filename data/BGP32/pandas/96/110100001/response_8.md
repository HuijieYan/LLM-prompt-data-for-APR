### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class which inherits from `BusinessMixin`.
2. The function is responsible for adjusting the datetime object based on business hours.
3. The buggy function is failing due to issues in handling business days and business hours adjustments.
4. The bug seems to be related to the calculation and adjustment of business days and remaining business hours.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `apply` function is likely caused by incorrect calculations and adjustments when dealing with negative business days. The logic for adjusting the datetime object based on business days and remaining business hours is not correctly implemented.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Correct the calculation and adjustment logic for negative business days in the function.
2. Ensure proper handling of remaining business hours in both positive and negative scenarios.
3. Verify the conditions for moving to the next business time interval and finishing the adjustment.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
            
            # adjust other based on business days and business hours
            while True:
                if n >= 0:
                    if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    if other.time() in self.start:
                        other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                    if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                        other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                
                businesshours = sum(
                    self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                    for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
                )
                
                bd = n//businesshours
                r = n%businesshours
                if n < 0:
                    bd, r = -bd, -r
                
                # adjust by business days first
                if bd != 0:
                    skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                    if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                        prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                        remain = other - prev_open
                        other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                    else:
                        other = other + skip_bd
                
                # remaining business hours to adjust
                bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
                
                while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
                    bhour = 0
                    if n >= 0:
                        bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    else:
                        bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    
                    if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        break
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        if n >= 0:
                            other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                        else:
                            other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
                
                return other
         
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the adjustment logic for business days and remaining business hours, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
