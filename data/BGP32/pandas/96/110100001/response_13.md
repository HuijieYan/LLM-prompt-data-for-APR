### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is a method within the `BusinessHourMixin` class.
2. The function is supposed to adjust a given datetime object based on business hours, but it has some logical errors that lead to incorrect adjustments.
3. The buggy function fails when custom business hours are applied to a datetime range that includes non-business hours, resulting in incorrect adjustments.
4. The strategy for fixing the bug involves correcting the logic for adjusting the datetime object based on business hours.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() not in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
    
            if bd != 0:
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other += skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other += bhour
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                    else:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                    else:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the logical errors in the adjustment process based on business hours, the corrected `apply` function should now work correctly and pass the failing test for custom business hours.
