## 1. Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is a method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which is supposed to adjust a given datetime according to business hours. The function checks if the input `other` is an instance of datetime and then applies a series of adjustments based on business hours.

## 2. Potential Error Locations:
- The logic for adjusting the input datetime based on business hours might have errors.
- Calculation of business hours and adjustment of the input might not be implemented correctly.
- The loops for adjusting business hours based on the remaining time could be problematic.

## 3. Cause of the Bug:
The bug might occur when adjusting the datetime based on business hours where the implementation might not correctly account for the business hour intervals and remaining time.

## 4. Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, it's important to review the logic for adjusting the input datetime based on business hours. Ensuring that the calculations are accurate and that the loops handle the remaining time correctly will be crucial.

## Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))

        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
        
        # Adjust by business days
        if bd != 0:
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By reviewing and adjusting the logic for the adjustments based on business hours and the remaining time, the corrected version of the `apply` function should now correctly adjust the input datetime.
