1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class which is a subclass of `BusinessMixin`. The function takes an input `other` and performs calculations to adjust the time based on business hours. The function checks if the input `other` is an instance of `datetime`, and if not, raises an error. The buggy behavior seems to be related to the logic used to adjust the time based on business hours.

2. Potential error locations within the buggy function:
   - Incorrect adjustment of the `other` datetime object based on business hours.
   - Calculation of business days and remaining business hours might have issues.
   - The loops for adjusting remaining business hours may not be working as intended.

3. Cause of the bug:
   The bug seems to be causing incorrect adjustments of the input datetime object `other` based on business hours. This leads to incorrect output times in the test case.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
   - Review and correct the logic used to adjust the input time based on business hours.
   - Ensure proper handling of business days and remaining business hours.
   - Debug the loops for adjusting remaining business hours to ensure correct behavior.

5. Corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        original_time = other
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other.replace(hour=23, minute=59)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + timedelta(days=1))

        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                adjust = min(bhour, bhour_remain)
                other += adjust
                bhour_remain -= adjust
                if bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                adjust = min(bhour, bhour_remain)
                other += adjust
                bhour_remain -= adjust
                if bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version makes adjustments to the input time `other` based on business hours in a more accurate way, following the intended logic. Running the test function after applying this correction should result in a passing test.
