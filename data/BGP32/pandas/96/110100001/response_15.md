The cause of the bug is related to the handling of custom business hours when adjusting the datetime object. The bug occurs when the function tries to calculate the next opening time or closing time based on the business hours, resulting in incorrect adjustments and leading to incorrect output.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic of adjusting the datetime object based on business days and remaining business hours. The adjustments should correctly consider the custom business hours and handle edge cases such as the boundary between two business days.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    # this is the corrected version of the function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

            n = self.n

            current_time = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, other.hour, other.minute, other.second, other.microsecond)

            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if current_time.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(current_time):
                    current_time = self._next_opening_time(current_time)
            else:
                if current_time.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    current_time = current_time - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(current_time):
                    current_time = self._next_opening_time(current_time)
                    current_time = self._get_closing_time(current_time)

            for _ in range(abs(n)):
                current_time = self._next_opening_time(current_time) if n >= 0 else self._prev_opening_time(current_time)

            return current_time
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the logic of handling business days and remaining business hours, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test for custom business hours.
