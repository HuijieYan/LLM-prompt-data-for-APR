## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is designed to adjust a given datetime object based on the BusinessHourMixin rules.
2. The bug might be related to how the adjustment for business hours is calculated and applied.
3. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` creates a custom business hour frequency with a start time of 15:00 and a holiday on 2020-11-26. It then generates a date range with 4 periods using this custom frequency. The expected result is a DatetimeIndex with specific timestamps at 15:00 and 16:00 on the given dates.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure the correct adjustment of business hours is applied when generating the date range with custom holidays.

## Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function to address the bug:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

            # Get total business hours by minutes in one business day
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = skip_bd.apply(other)

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    if n >= 0:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                    else:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With this corrected version of the `apply` function, the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` should pass successfully.
