## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class seems to be an implementation for adjusting datetime objects based on business hours.
2. The function is trying to adjust the given datetime `other` based on the business hours defined in the `start` and `end` attributes of the class.
3. The bug seems to be related to the adjustment logic within the function when calculating the business days and remaining business hours.
4. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is checking the behavior of the custom business hour offset, especially when holidays are involved.
5. The failing test indicates that the adjustment logic in the `apply` function is incorrect, resulting in the test failure.

## Bug Cause:
The bug may be caused by incorrect calculations and adjustments within the `apply` function when handling negative offsets (moving backwards) and the calculation of remaining business hours.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to review and correct the logic within the `apply` function, especially the part where it adjusts the datetime based on the business hours. The adjustments for negative offsets and remaining business hours need to be handled correctly.

## Corrected Version:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            other = as_datetime(other)  # Using helper function to safely convert to datetime
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() >= max(self.end) or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() <= min(self.start) or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

            business_hours_sec = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours_sec // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        break
                    else:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                else:
                    bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                        other -= bhour_remain
                        break
                    else:
                        other = self._prev_opening_time(other - bhour)
                        bhour_remain -= bhour

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
In the corrected version:
- The adjustments for moving forward and backward in time are corrected.
- The calculations for remaining business hours are corrected.
- Helper functions and comparison operators for time ranges have been used to improve clarity and accuracy.
