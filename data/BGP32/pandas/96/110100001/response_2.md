## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `BusinessHourMixin` module.
2. The function tries to apply a business hour offset to a given datetime object.
3. The bug seems to be related to the logic used to adjust the datetime based on business hours and days.
4. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` tries to create a date range with custom business hours, but it fails due to the bug in the `apply` function.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the `apply` function seems to be related to how it handles the adjustment of business days and hours for positive and negative offsets. This leads to incorrect adjustments when applying custom business hours.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
We need to review and fix the logic for adjusting business days and hours within the `apply` function to ensure correct application of custom business hours to the input datetime.

## Corrected Version:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessMixin, BusinessDay
from pandas._libs.tslibs.offsets import ApplyTypeError
from pandas.tseries.offsets import apply_wraps
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            start_time = other.time()
            
            if n >= 0:
                if start_time >= self.end[0] or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if start_time < self.start[0]:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            if n < 0:
                n *= -1
            
            business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                                 for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
            
            bd, r = divmod(n * 60, business_hours // 60)
            if self.n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
            
            if bd != 0:
                bd_offset = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + bd_offset + remain
                else:
                    other = other + bd_offset
            
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            
            while bhour_remain:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function should address the bug and ensure correct adjustment of the datetime based on the custom business hours defined in the `BusinessHourMixin` class. This should make the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` pass successfully.
