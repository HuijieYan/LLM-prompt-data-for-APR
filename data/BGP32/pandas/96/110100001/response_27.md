## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is a method in the `BusinessHourMixin` class.
2. The function is designed to calculate the adjusted time based on business hours and offsets.
3. The bug may be related to the calculation logic and adjustment of the input datetime based on business hours.
4. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is checking if the date range generated using custom business hours is correct.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the `apply` function might be related to the incorrect adjustment of the input datetime based on the business hours. The calculation logic for adjusting the time seems to have errors which are causing the incorrect output leading to the failing test.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Review the logic for adjusting the input datetime based on business hours.
2. Correct any calculations that might be causing incorrect adjustments.
3. Ensure that the adjustments properly handle cases where the business time interval changes.

## Corrected Version of the `apply` function:
```python
# Corrected version of the apply function
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        bd = 0
        r = 0
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        
        # adjust other to reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        
        # adjust other based on business hours
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        # calculate total business hours in a day
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        # adjust by business days
        skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
        prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
        remain = other - prev_open
        
        if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
            other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
        else:
            other = other + skip_bd
        
        # adjust remaining business hours
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        
        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                
            if bhour_remain < bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the adjustment logic and handling the business hour adjustment properly, the corrected version of the `apply` function should now pass the failing test.
