### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is responsible for applying business hours to a datetime object. The bug seems to occur when adjusting the datetime object with business hours.

### Identified Potential Error:
The bug seems to be related to the adjustment of the datetime object with business hours, particularly when handling negative business hours.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by incorrect logic or calculations when adjusting the datetime object with negative business hours. It may be failing to correctly move to the previous business day and adjust the remaining business hours.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the adjustment logic for both positive and negative business hours is correct.
2. Verify the handling of negative business hours and moving to the previous business day.
3. Debug and test the logic to accurately adjust the datetime object with business hours.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessMixin, ApplyTypeError
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if bd != 0 and not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After incorporating the updates to the `apply` function, the bug should be fixed, and the corrected function should be able to handle adjusting datetime objects with business hours correctly.
