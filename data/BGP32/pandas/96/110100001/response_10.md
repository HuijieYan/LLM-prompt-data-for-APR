## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class which inherits from `BusinessMixin`.
2. The function is responsible for adjusting a given datetime to the next business hour according to the specified business hour intervals.
3. The bug in the function is causing incorrect adjustments to the datetime, leading to failing tests.
4. The bug seems to be related to the calculation and adjustment of business hours and intervals.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `apply` function causes incorrect adjustment of the input datetime to the next business hour. This results in the failing test because the adjusted datetimes do not match the expected values. The bug seems to be related to the calculations of business hours and intervals within different scenarios.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `apply` function, we need to carefully analyze the logic related to the adjustment of business hours and intervals. Correctly handling positive and negative business hour adjustments, checking the business day, and ensuring accurate adjustment of the datetime are crucial for fixing the bug. 

## Corrected Version:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            original_other = other
            self.adapt_start(original_other)
            n = self.n

            # adjust the time to the next business hour according to the business hour intervals
            while n != 0:
                if n > 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    n -= 1
                elif n < 0:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    n += 1

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version of the function, adjustments to the input datetime are made by correctly iterating through the business hour intervals based on the value of `n`. The functions `_next_opening_time` and `_prev_opening_time` are used to determine the appropriate adjustment of the datetime. This corrected version should resolve the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
