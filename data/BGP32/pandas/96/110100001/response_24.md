## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is trying to adjust the input datetime based on a business hour offset, but it contains logic that is causing incorrect adjustments.
2. The function seems to have issues with handling positive and negative offsets differently, adjusting dates to next business day, and calculating business hours.
3. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is trying to create a date range with a custom business hour frequency but the adjusted dates are incorrect, leading to a test failure.
4. To fix the bug, we need to review and correct the logic within the `apply` function to accurately adjust datetime objects based on the business hour offset.

## Bug Fix:
```python
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            # adjust other based on offset
            if n >= 0:
                while not self._is_on_offset(other) and other.time() not in self.end:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                while not self._is_on_offset(other) and other.time() not in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                    while not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # adjust by business days
            if bd != 0:
                other = other + bd * BusinessDay()

            # adjust by remaining business hours
            if r != 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other if n >= 0 else other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                bhour_remain = r * timedelta(minutes=1)
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other) if n >= 0 else self._prev_opening_time(other)
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                    else:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With the above corrected version of the `apply` function, the provided test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` should pass without any issues.
