## Analysis:
The buggy function is `apply` inside the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The function is responsible for adjusting datetime objects based on business hours defined in `start` and `end` attributes of the class.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect adjustment of business days in the negative `n` case.
2. Incorrect handling of remaining business hours to adjust.
3. Calculation of business hours to cover in one business day.

## Bug Cause:
The bug causes incorrect adjustments of the datetime objects when calculating negative business day offsets and when adjusting remaining business hours within a business day.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Correct the adjustment of business days in the negative case.
2. Improve the handling of remaining business hours to adjust.
3. Ensure accurate calculation of business hours covering one business day.

## Corrected Version:

                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Applying the corrections above should fix the bug and make the provided failing test (`test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`) pass successfully.
