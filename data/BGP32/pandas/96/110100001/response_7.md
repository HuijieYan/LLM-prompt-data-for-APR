### Analysis:
- The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is responsible for adjusting a datetime object based on business hours.
- The function checks if the input `other` is an instance of `datetime`, adjusts it based on business hours, and returns the adjusted datetime.
- The bug seems to be related to the calculation and adjustment of business hours, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug:
- The bug seems to be related to the calculation and adjustment of business hours, leading to incorrect adjustments when the input datetime is passed through the function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Review the calculation and adjustment logic of the business hours to ensure it correctly handles both positive and negative offsets.
- Check for any edge cases where the adjustment may not be working as intended and make necessary corrections.
- Make sure that the adjustments result in the expected datetime output based on the business hours specified.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            direction = 1 if n >= 0 else -1

            start_index = -1
            end_index = 0

            if direction == 1:
                start_index = 0
                end_index = -1

            business_hours_total = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            offset_days, remaining_seconds = divmod(abs(n) * 60, business_hours_total // 60)
            if n < 0:
                offset_days = -offset_days
                remaining_seconds = -remaining_seconds

            if offset_days != 0:
                skip_days = BusinessDay(n=offset_days)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_days + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_days

            seconds_remaining = timedelta(minutes=remaining_seconds)

            while seconds_remaining != timedelta(0):
                if direction == 1:
                    next_opening_time = self._next_opening_time(other + timedelta(seconds=1))
                    business_hour = min(
                        self._get_closing_time(next_opening_time) - next_opening_time,
                        seconds_remaining
                    )
                    other += business_hour
                else:
                    closing_time = self._get_closing_time(other)
                    next_opening_time = self._next_opening_time(closing_time)
                    business_hour = min(
                        closing_time - other,
                        timedelta(minutes=remaining_seconds) if other.time() in self.start else timedelta(0)
                    )
                    if business_hour == timedelta(0):
                        business_hour = next_opening_time - closing_time
                    other = next_opening_time

                seconds_remaining -= business_hour

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After fixing the bug in the `apply` function, the failing test should pass successfully.
