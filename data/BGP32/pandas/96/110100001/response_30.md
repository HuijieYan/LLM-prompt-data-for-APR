The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is not handling the adjustment of business hours correctly, leading to incorrect results when adjusting the input `datetime` object based on the business hours defined.

The error seems to be related to the adjustment of the business hours and the handling of the business days. The logic for adjusting the business hours in the provided code is causing the failure in the test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for adjusting the business hours and ensure that the adjustments are correctly applied based on the specified business hours.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        
        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(days=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        while n != 0:
            if n > 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                n -= 1
            else:
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                n += 1
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By implementing this corrected version of the `apply` function, the test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` should pass successfully.
