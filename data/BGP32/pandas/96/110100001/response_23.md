1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the pandas library. It is used to adjust datetime objects based on business hours. The function has issues with handling negative business hours, leading to failing tests when using custom business hours with specific holidays.

2. The potential error locations within the buggy function include the handling of negative business hour values and adjusting the datetime objects accordingly.

3. The bug is caused by not properly handling negative business hour values in the `apply` function. This results in incorrect adjustments to the datetime objects, leading to failing tests when using custom business hours with holidays.

4. A strategy for fixing the bug would involve revising the logic for handling negative business hour values and adjusting the datetime objects accurately based on the specified business hours.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
    
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
    
            if bd != 0:
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if self._is_on_offset(other):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
    
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                else:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function should fix the bug related to handling negative business hour values and address the failing tests with custom business hours and holidays.
