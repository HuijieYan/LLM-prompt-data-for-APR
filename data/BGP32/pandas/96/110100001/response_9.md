## Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is responsible for adjusting datetime objects based on business hours. The function tries to handle cases where the input `other` is a datetime object and perform adjustments based on the business hours. However, there are several potential error locations within the function that can lead to incorrect adjustments.

## Identified Bug:
The bug in the function causes incorrect adjustments to datetime objects, leading to unexpected output. This bug is likely related to how the function handles adjusting the input `other` based on business hours and business days.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to carefully examine the logic in the function and ensure that the adjustments made to the datetime object are correct based on the business hours and business days.

## Corrected Version:
```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            if n >= 0:
                start_time = self.start[0]
                is_on_offset = other.time() in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other)
                if is_on_offset:
                    closest_opening = max([t for t in self.start if t <= other.time()])
                    if closest_opening == other.time():
                        other = datetime.combine(other.date(), closest_opening)
                    else:
                        close_time = min([t for t in self.end if t >= closest_opening])
                        other = datetime.combine(other.date(), close_time)
                else:
                    next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = datetime.combine(other.date(), next_opening.time())
            else:
                start_time = self.start[-1]
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = datetime.combine(other.date() - timedelta(days=1), start_time)
                elif other.time() in self.end:
                    closest_opening = max([t for t in self.start if t <= start_time])
                    other = datetime.combine(other.date(), closest_opening)
                else:
                    closest_opening = max([t for t in self.start if t <= other.time()])
                    other = datetime.combine(other.date(), closest_opening)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the adjustments to the datetime object `other` are handled based on the business hours and the specific edge conditions. This should resolve the bug and ensure that the function works correctly with the provided test case.
