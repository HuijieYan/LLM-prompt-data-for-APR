## Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is trying to apply business hour offsets to datetime objects. It seems to have issues with adjusting the datetime object based on the business hour offset, resulting in incorrect outputs.

## Identified Issue:
The bug seems to be related to how the function is calculating and adjusting the datetime object based on the business hour offset. It fails to correctly handle the case when the `n` value (offset) is negative, causing incorrect adjustments.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from incorrect logic in adjusting the datetime object based on the business hour offset, especially when the offset `n` is negative. The function fails to handle the adjustments properly, leading to incorrect output.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure correct adjustment of the datetime object based on the business hour offset, considering both positive and negative offset values.
2. Verify the logic for moving to the next opening/closing time within the business hour intervals and adjust the datetime object accordingly.
3. Handle edge cases where the adjustments need to consider different scenarios based on the business hour configurations.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        break
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain < timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        break
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making adjustments to handle negative offset values properly and ensuring correct transitions between business hour intervals, the corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing test.
