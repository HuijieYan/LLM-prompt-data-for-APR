### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class has logic to adjust a given datetime object based on business hours. The issue seems to be related to how the adjustments are made for positive and negative values of `n`.

### Error Location:
The potential error locations in the buggy function are primarily in the logic for adjusting the datetime object based on business hours and the conditionals for handling positive and negative values of `n`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the adjustments for negative values of `n` to be incorrectly calculated, leading to unexpected results when adjusting the datetime based on business hours.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to review the logic for adjusting the datetime object for negative values of `n` and ensure that the adjustments are made correctly based on business hours.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    # corrected version of the apply function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Check edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            n = self.n

            # Skip resetting timezone and nanosecond as Timestamp can be used
            # Adjust other to reduce cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other -= bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._prev_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1)
                        )

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version adjusts the logic for handling negative values of `n` when adjusting the datetime object based on business hours, ensuring the correct adjustments are made for both positive and negative cases.
