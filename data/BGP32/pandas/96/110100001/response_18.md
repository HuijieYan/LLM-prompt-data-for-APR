## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which is a mixin class inheriting from `BusinessMixin`.
2. The function is designed to adjust a given datetime object based on business hours specified by `start` and `end` attributes of the class.
3. The bug seems to be related to the calculation of business days and business hours, causing incorrect adjustments to the datetime object.
4. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is checking if a custom business hour with holidays is working correctly, but the buggy function results in incorrect adjustments.

## Bug:
The bug in the `apply` function is causing incorrect adjustments to the given datetime object when calculating business days and business hours. This leads to the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Identify and fix the logic related to business days calculation for both positive and negative `n` values.
2. Correctly handle the adjustment of business hours within each business interval.
3. Ensure that the output datetime object aligns with the specified business hours.

## Fixed Version:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                while n > 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    n -= 1
            else:
                while n < 0:
                    other = other - timedelta(minutes=60)
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Applying this fix should address the bug and make the `apply` function work correctly with the failing test.
