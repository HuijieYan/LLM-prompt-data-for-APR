### Analysis:
The `apply` function in the `BusinessHourMixin` class seems to be causing the error in the test case. The error message indicates a mismatch in the inferred frequency from passed values and the passed frequency `CBH` (CustomBusinessHour).

### Issue:
The `apply` function is not correctly handling the calculation related to business hours, skipping business days, adjusting business hours, and moving between business time intervals appropriately. This results in the incorrect output that fails the test case.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. The function needs to correctly handle the adjustment of business hours based on the provided offsets.
2. Ensure the function properly handles positive and negative business hours and adjusts the datetime accordingly.
3. Make sure to adjust between different business days when required.
4. Address the issue of moving between business time intervals accurately.

### Correction:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function that should pass the failing test:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            year=other.year,
            month=other.month,
            day=other.day,
            hour=other.hour,
            minute=other.minute,
            second=other.second,
            microsecond=other.microsecond
        )

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)

            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        if n >= 0:
            other += BusinessDay(n=n)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        minutes_to_add = n * 60 % businesshours

        if n < 0:
            minutes_to_add = -minutes_to_add

        other += timedelta(minutes=minutes_to_add)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the logic for adjusting business hours and days, the corrected `apply` function should now handle the provided offsets correctly and pass the failing test case.
