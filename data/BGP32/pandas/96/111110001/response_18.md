### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which is a subclass of `BusinessMixin`.
2. The buggy function is using various helper functions within the same class to calculate the adjusted datetime based on business hours.
3. The error message indicates a validation error related to the frequency of datetime indexes and the custom business hour frequency.
4. The bug seems to be related to the adjustment of business days and business hours in the `apply` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to be caused by incorrect adjustment of business days and business hours within the `apply` function. This leads to an inconsistency in the frequency of the datetime index generated with the custom business hour frequency.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustment of business days and business hours is done correctly so that the frequency of the datetime index aligns with the custom business hour frequency.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Fix the buggy function implementation
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bd != 0:
                    skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                    if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                        prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                        remain = other - prev_open
                        other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                    else:
                        other = other + skip_bd
                    bd = 0
    
                bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = (
                        self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    )
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                    
            else:
                while bd != 0:
                    skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                    if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                        prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                        remain = other - prev_open
                        other = prev_open - skip_bd + remain
                    else:
                        other = other - skip_bd
                    bd = 0
    
                bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=-r)
    
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other - bhour + timedelta(seconds=1)))
                
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

By correcting the adjustment of business days and business hours within the `apply` function, we can fix the bug causing the frequency validation error.
