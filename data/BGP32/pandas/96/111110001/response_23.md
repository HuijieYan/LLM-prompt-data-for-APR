### Analysis:
The buggy function is the `apply` method within the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The function seems to handle business hours offset calculations based on a given datetime object.

The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is testing the behavior of custom business hours with specified holidays. The error message indicates a failure in validating the frequency of the generated date range.

### Identified Issue:
The bug seems to be related to the custom business hour offset calculation within the `apply` method. It appears that the calculation logic within the function is not correctly handling the provided custom business hour frequency.

### Bug Cause:
The bug might be caused by incorrect handling of the custom business hour frequency which leads to inconsistencies in date generation and validation.

### Suggested Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to review the custom business hour frequency handling within the `apply` method and ensure that the calculation logic aligns with the expected behavior. This may involve adjusting the calculations based on the custom business hour offset and making sure the date/time values are generated correctly.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` method based on the analysis above:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour or bhour_remain == bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should address the issue and align the custom business hour offset calculation logic with the expected behavior. This should make the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` pass successfully.
