### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is responsible for adjusting a given datetime based on business hours and days. The error occurs when creating a `DatetimeIndex` object in the test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`, which calls the `apply` function, resulting in a `ValueError` related to frequency validation.

### Identified Issues:
1. The `apply` function is not properly adjusting the datetime based on business hours and days, leading to incorrect results.
2. The error in the test function is due to the frequency validation failing when creating the expected `DatetimeIndex`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by incorrect adjustments of the datetime in the `apply` function, which affects the validation of the frequency in the test function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments made in the `apply` function align with the expected behavior based on business hours and days. Additionally, we need to address the frequency validation issue when creating the `DatetimeIndex` object.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to normalize it
        other = other.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() >= max(self.end) or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() <= min(self.start) or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        bd = n // len(self.start)
        r = n % len(self.start)

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = skip_bd.rollback(other)
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r * 60)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain < timedelta(0):
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if bhour_remain > bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain += bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other - bhour))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Changes Made:
1. Adjusted the logic for adjusting the `other` datetime based on business hours and days.
2. Normalized the `other` datetime by removing the time components that may cause issues.
3. Fixed the calculation of business days and remaining hours.
4. Handled both positive and negative adjustments of the datetime correctly.

By implementing these changes, the bug in the `apply` function should be fixed, and the test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` should pass without any errors.
