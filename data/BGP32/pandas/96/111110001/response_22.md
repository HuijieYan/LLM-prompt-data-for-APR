### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is within the `BusinessHourMixin` class. It takes another datetime object as input and performs calculations based on the business hours defined in the class attributes.
2. The error message points to a validation issue related to frequency in the `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` function. This test uses a custom business hour frequency, which triggers the validation check and fails due to an incorrect frequency comparison.
3. The bug seems to be related to how the custom business hour frequency is handled within the `apply` function, resulting in a mismatch during frequency validation.
4. The bug can be fixed by ensuring that the calculation within the `apply` function correctly adjusts the input datetime according to the defined business hours without causing any frequency discrepancies.
5. To fix the bug, the `apply` function should be modified to correctly handle the custom business hour frequency and adjust the input datetime accordingly.

Apply this updated `apply` function and re-run the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`. This should now pass without any validation errors.
