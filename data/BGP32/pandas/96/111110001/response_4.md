### Analysis:
1. The `apply` function is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class and is intended to adjust a given datetime based on business hours.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` involves creating a date range using a custom business hour frequency, but the adjustment made by the `apply` function doesn't produce the expected result.
3. The error message indicates a problem with validating the frequency of the date range generated, suggesting that the adjustments made by the `apply` function are not accurate.
4. The bug is likely caused by incorrect adjustments or calculations within the `apply` function, leading to an incorrect output.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `apply` function seems to stem from the calculations of adjusting the datetime based on business hours. The incorrect adjustments result in an incorrect output date range. This causes the frequency validation to fail in the test function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, the adjustments made to the datetime within the `apply` function need to be corrected. The calculations related to business hours adjustment may need to be revised to ensure the correct positioning of dates based on the specified business hours.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

        business_hours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)

            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other if n >= 0 else self._prev_opening_time(other) - other

            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other) if n >= 0 else self._prev_opening_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the business hours calculations and datetime adjustments in the `apply` function, the corrected version should now pass the failing test and provide the expected date range output.
