### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class and is supposed to apply business hours to a given datetime.
2. The error message indicates a mismatch between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency when creating a `DatetimeIndex`.
3. The bug likely lies in the calculation and adjustment of business hours in the `apply` function, leading to an incorrect output frequency.
4. One way to fix the bug is to revisit the logic for adjusting business hours and ensure that the calculation aligns with the expected frequency of the output `DatetimeIndex`.

### Bug Fix:
```python
# Fixing the buggy function apply

# Import necessary modules
import pandas as pd
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour, ApplyTypeError
from pandas.tseries.frequencies import to_offset

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # Other functions remain the same

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() >= self.end[0] or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() <= self.start[0]:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n), businesshours / 3600)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                freq = CustomBusinessHour(start=f"{self.start[0].hour:02}:{self.start[0].minute:02}")
                other = pd.date_range(other, periods=bd, freq=freq)[-1]

            if n >= 0:
                while r > 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                    if r < bhour.total_seconds() / 60:
                        other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                        r = 0
                    else:
                        r -= bhour.total_seconds() / 60
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other) + bhour
            else:
                while r < 0:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if r < bhour.total_seconds() / 60:
                        other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                        r = 0
                    else:
                        r -= bhour.total_seconds() / 60
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the logic for applying business hours and handling the adjustment of dates and times for business hours correctly, the corrected version of the `apply` function should pass the failing test and prevent the frequency mismatch error.
