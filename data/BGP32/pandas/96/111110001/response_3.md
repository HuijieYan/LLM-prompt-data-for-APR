### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is failing to correctly adjust the business hours when applying a custom business hour frequency, as demonstrated in the failing test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`. The error message indicates a mismatch in the inferred frequency and the passed frequency.

### Bug Location:
The issue seems to arise from how the function is handling adjustments based on business days and remaining business hours. Particularly, the calculation of business days and the adjustment of remaining business hours might not be correctly synchronized with the custom business hour frequency provided.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by improper adjustments to the provided datetime object when applying a custom business hour frequency. The incorrect handling of business day adjustments and remaining business hours could lead to discrepancies in the time intervals, causing the mismatch in inferred frequency.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments made for business days and remaining business hours are aligned with the custom business hour frequency provided. Properly synchronizing the adjustments will help in generating the correct datetime index based on the custom business hour frequency.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function in the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0)  # Reset timezone and nanosecond
        n = self.n
        
        # Adjust other based on the custom business hour frequency
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        # Calculate total business hours in one business day
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        
        # Adjust based on business days and remaining business hours
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        if bd != 0:  # Adjust by business days first
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self.next_bday(other)
            other += skip_bd
        
        if r != 0:  # Adjust remaining business hours
            bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other if n < 0 else self._get_closing_time(other) - other
            while r > 0:
                if r < bhour.total_seconds() // 60:
                    other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                    break
                other += bhour
                r -= bhour.total_seconds() // 60
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by ensuring that the adjustments made for business days and remaining business hours are synchronized with the custom business hour frequency provided, producing the expected datetime index.
