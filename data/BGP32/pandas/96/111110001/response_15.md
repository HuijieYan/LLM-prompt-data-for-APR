### Analysis:
The `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is causing the error in the test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` located in `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py`. The error message suggests that the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency `CBH`.

### Error Location:
The issue seems to be related to the calculation and adjustment of the business hours within the `apply` function. Specifically, the adjustment of the business days and remaining business hours could be leading to incorrect calculations.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be arising from the adjustments made for negative business hours (`n < 0`) in the `apply` function. It appears that the logic for adjusting business hours and days in the negative case is incorrect, leading to misalignment of the calculated timestamps.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting business days and hours needs to be revised to ensure correct calculation and adjustment of timestamps based on the business hour settings.

### Corrected Version:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            # convert to datetime object
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            seconds = 0
            for i in range(abs(bd)):
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self.next_bday(other)
                else:
                    other = self.prev_bday(other)
                seconds += sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    work_time_left = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
                    if work_time_left.seconds * 60 >= bhour_remain.seconds:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= timedelta(seconds=work_time_left.seconds * 60)
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + timedelta(seconds=work_time_left.seconds * 60))
                else:
                    work_time_left = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
                    if work_time_left.seconds * 60 >= abs(bhour_remain.seconds):
                        other -= bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain += timedelta(seconds=work_time_left.seconds * 60)
                        other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With this corrected version of the `apply` function, the issue with the test case should be resolved, and it should now pass successfully.
