### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the file `pandas/tseries/offsets.py`.
2. The function is supposed to apply a business offset to a datetime object, but there is a bug causing it to fail.
3. The error message indicates a failure in validating the frequency of the generated datetime index when using a custom business hour offset.
4. The bug seems to be related to how the business offset is applied and adjusted within the function, leading to incorrect frequency validation.
5. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for applying the business offset to datetime objects to ensure the frequency validation passes.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `apply` function causes the frequency validation to fail when using a custom business hour offset. The issue arises from an incorrect adjustment of the datetime object when applying the business offset, leading to inconsistencies in frequency calculations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the logic for applying the business offset to datetime objects based on the positive or negative offset value.
2. Ensure that the adjustment aligns with business hours and maintains the correct frequency for the generated datetime index.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import ApplyTypeError, BaseOffset, CustomBusinessHour, BusinessMixin, BusinessDay
from datetime import timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, other.hour, other.minute, other.second, other.microsecond)

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = other + skip_bd
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Applying the corrections to the `apply` function as outlined above should address the frequency validation issue in the failing test scenario.
