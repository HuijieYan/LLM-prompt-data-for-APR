### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is meant to adjust a given `datetime` object based on business hours specified by the class instance.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is testing the behavior of the `CustomBusinessHour` offset, which extends the `CustomBusinessMixin` class. This failing test is due to an issue with the adjustments made by the `apply` function.
3. The error message indicates a failure in validating the frequency when using the `CustomBusinessHour` offset, specifically stating that the inferred frequency does not conform to the expected frequency.
4. The cause of the bug can be traced to the incorrect adjustments made in the `apply` function, leading to an incorrect outcome and frequency validation failure.
5. To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic of the `apply` function to properly adjust the given `datetime` object according to the specified business hours.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Identify and correct the logic for adjusting the input datetime based on the business hours of the `BusinessHourMixin` instance.
2. Ensure that the adjustments align correctly with the expected behavior of the `CustomBusinessHour` offset.
3. Make necessary modifications to handle positive and negative offsets appropriately.
4. Verify that the adjusted datetime aligns with the expected frequency for the `CustomBusinessHour` offset.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:
```python
    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if (
                        bhour_remain > bhour
                        or bhour_remain == bhour
                    ):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))
                        )
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

By correcting the logic within the `apply` function, we aim to address the business hour adjustments accurately, hence resolving the issue with the failing test related to frequency validation.
