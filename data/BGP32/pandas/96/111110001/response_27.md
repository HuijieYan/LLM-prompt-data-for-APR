### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `apply` method inside the `BusinessHourMixin` class, located in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file. This function is responsible for applying the business hour offset to a given datetime.
2. The error message indicates a failure in validating the frequency in a DatetimeIndex, caused by an incorrect implementation in the `apply` method.
3. The bug seems to be related to the handling of custom business hours, as mentioned in the failing test. The error is thrown when comparing frequencies during validation, suggesting a problem with the way business hour offsets are calculated.
4. To fix the bug, we should review the logic in the `apply` method related to adjusting datetime objects based on business hour offsets and ensure that the calculations are correct and compatible with the frequency validation.
5. By adjusting the logic for handling business hour offsets correctly, we can ensure that the `apply` method generates the expected DatetimeIndex with custom business hours.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from datetime import timedelta
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessMixin, ApplyTypeError, BusinessDay

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @classmethod
    def _is_at_offset(cls, dt):
        return dt.time() in cls.start or dt.time() in cls.end

    @classmethod
    def _next_opening_time(cls, dt):
        return dt + timedelta(seconds=1)

    @classmethod
    def _get_closing_time(cls, dt):
        return dt + timedelta(hours=1)

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            if self._is_at_offset(other) or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                
            business_hours_sec = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(s_time, e_time) for s_time, e_time in zip(self.start, self.end))

            bd, r = divmod(abs(self.n), business_hours_sec // 60)
            if self.n < 0:
                bd = -bd
                r = -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self.next_bday._next_opening_time(other)
                other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if self.n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the logic in the `apply` method based on the provided explanation, the function should now handle custom business hours correctly and pass the failing test.
