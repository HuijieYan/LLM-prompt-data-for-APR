### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is supposed to handle adjustments of business hours based on a given datetime input.
2. The function `apply` makes adjustments to a given datetime based on the business hours specified within the class.
3. The bug causes an error in the test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` related to the frequency validation not conforming to the expected output.
4. The error is likely due to incorrect adjustments made within the `apply` function that result in the unexpected output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the adjustments made within the `apply` function are correctly aligning with the specified business hours.
2. Check the logic for adjusting the datetime based on positive and negative business hour values.
3. Make sure the adjustments cover all possible scenarios for business hours.

### Bug Fix - Corrected Version:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                while not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    other += BusinessDay(n=1)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                while not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    other -= BusinessDay(n=1)

            start_dt = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, self.start[0].hour, self.start[0].minute, self.start[0].second, self.start[0].microsecond)
            business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
            total_seconds = abs(n) * 60 * business_hours
            if n < 0:
                total_seconds = -total_seconds

            if n >= 0:
                while total_seconds != 0:
                    opening_time = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    closing_time = self._get_closing_time(opening_time)
                    seconds_to_next_interval = (closing_time - other).total_seconds()
                    if total_seconds < seconds_to_next_interval:
                        other += timedelta(seconds=total_seconds)
                        total_seconds = 0
                    else:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(closing_time)
                        total_seconds -= seconds_to_next_interval
            else:
                while total_seconds != 0:
                    opening_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    closing_time = self._get_closing_time(opening_time)
                    seconds_to_next_interval = (closing_time - other).total_seconds()
                    if total_seconds > seconds_to_next_interval or (total_seconds == seconds_to_next_interval and other.nanosecond != 0):
                        other += timedelta(seconds=total_seconds)
                        total_seconds = 0
                    else:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(opening_time - timedelta(seconds=1))
                        total_seconds -= seconds_to_next_interval

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `apply` function should now handle the adjustments to business hours correctly based on the input datetime, addressing the issue that caused the failing test.
