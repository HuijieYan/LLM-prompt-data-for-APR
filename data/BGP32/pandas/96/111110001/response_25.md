### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is failing to handle a custom business hour frequency correctly when passed to `pd.date_range`. The error in the failing test indicates a failure in frequency validation due to an incorrect inferred frequency.

### Bug Cause:
The bug stems from the incorrect processing of the custom business hour frequency within the `apply` function. When converting the frequency to a datetime object, the function does not handle the custom business hour attribute properly, leading to an incorrect inferred frequency during validation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the custom business hour frequency is correctly handled when adjusting the time in the `apply` function. Specifically, we need to include the custom business hour attribute in the adjustments to retain the correct frequency information.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            freq_str = str(self)
            n = self.n

            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond
            )

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            if n < 0:
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if self.next_bday().is_on_offset(other):
                    other = other + skip_bd
                else:
                    other = other - offset

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                    adjusted_time = other + min(bhour, bhour_remain)
                    other = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_time)
                    bhour_remain -= adjusted_time - other
                else:
                    bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    adjusted_time = other - min(bhour, bhour_remain)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(adjusted_time)
                    bhour_remain -= other - adjusted_time

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Applying the corrected version above should resolve the bug and ensure that the frequency validation for the custom business hour is successful in the failing test.
