### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is supposed to adjust a given datetime based on business hours defined by the class attributes. However, it seems to have a logical error in handling the adjustment process.
2. The error message from the failing test indicates a discrepancy in the inferred frequency compared to the passed frequency, leading to a `ValueError`.
3. The bug likely stems from the logic in the adjustment process for negative business hours and the calculation of remaining business hours.
4. To fix the bug, the adjustment process should be revised to accurately handle positive and negative business hours, ensuring the correct behavior based on the business hour definitions.
5. The code needs to ensure that the adjustments align with the defined business hours and correctly adjust the datetime values.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, datetime):
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
    
    n = self.n

    # adjust other to remove timezone and nanosecond
    other = other.replace(microsecond=0, tzinfo=None)

    if n >= 0:
        if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
    else:
        if other.time() in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
            other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

    businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

    bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
    if n < 0:
        bd, r = -bd, -r

    if bd != 0:
        skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
        other = self._next_opening_time(other) if n >= 0 and not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other) else other
        other += skip_bd

    if r != 0:
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            step = 1 if n >= 0 else -1
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other)) - other if step >= 0 else other - self._next_opening_time(other)

            if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour) if step >= 0 else self._get_closing_time(other - bhour)
                bhour_remain -= bhour
            else:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

    return other
```

By using this corrected version of the `apply` function, it should address the bug and ensure proper adjustment of datetimes based on the defined business hour rules.
