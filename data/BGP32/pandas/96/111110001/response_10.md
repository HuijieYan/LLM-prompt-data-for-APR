### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class and is responsible for applying a custom business hour frequency to a datetime object.
2. The error message indicates a `ValueError` raised during frequency validation for a `DatetimeIndex` with a custom business hour frequency that does not conform.
3. The bug likely stems from the incorrect application of the custom business hour frequency within the `apply` function, resulting in the mismatched frequency.
4. The bug causes the failing test to expect certain datetime values based on the custom business hour frequency, which does not match the actual output due to the frequency calculation issue.
5. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `apply` function to correctly apply the custom business hour frequency without causing a frequency mismatch.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function to resolve the bug:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            # Adjust datetime object to reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = other.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
            
            if n >= 0:
                while True:
                    if other.hour in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        break
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.hour in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                
                while True:
                    if other.hour in self.end and self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                        break
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the logic to correctly iterate over the time intervals based on the custom business hour frequency, the corrected `apply` function should now pass the failing test without raising frequency mismatch errors.
