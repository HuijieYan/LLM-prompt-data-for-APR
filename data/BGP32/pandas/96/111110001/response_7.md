### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is designed to adjust a given datetime object based on business hours. It contains logic to handle positive and negative adjustments based on the business hours specified.
2. There is a conditional check that adjusts the input datetime object `other` based on whether `n` (the adjustment value) is positive or negative. The logic inside the conditionals needs to correctly adjust the `other` datetime object to align with the business hours.
3. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` tries to create a date range using `pd.date_range` with a custom business hour offset. The expected result should reflect the adjusted datetime objects based on the provided business hours. However, due to the bug in the `apply` function, the adjustments are incorrect, leading to a mismatch with the expected result.
4. The bug seems to be related to the way the adjustments are calculated inside the conditionals. The adjustment logic for both positive and negative cases needs to be corrected to properly handle the business hours offset.
5. The error message indicates a mismatch in the inferred frequency compared to the passed frequency, suggesting that the adjustments made by the `apply` function are not aligning with the specified business hours.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Inspect the logic inside the conditionals for adjusting the `other` datetime object to ensure that it correctly aligns with the business hours specified by the `start` and `end` attributes.
2. Make sure that both positive and negative adjustments are handled accurately and that the adjustments are within the specified business hours range.
3. Modify the adjustment logic to properly calculate the adjustments based on the business hours and the adjustment value `n`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
import pandas as pd
from pandas.core.arrays.datetimes import DatetimeArray
from pandas.core.arrays.datetimelike import _validate_frequency

class BusinessHourMixin:

    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            
            # Adjust other to reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
    
            if n >= 0:

                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            # Get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            
            if n >= 0:
                diff = 0
                while diff < abs(n) * 60:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    diff += self._get_business_hours_by_sec(self.start[0], self.end[0])
            else:
                diff = 0
                while diff < abs(n) * 60:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    diff += self._get_business_hours_by_sec(self.start[0], self.end[0])
                    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

# Test the corrected function
test_date_range_with_custom_holidays()
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function should now properly adjust the input datetime object based on the specified business hours, fixing the bug and passing the failing test.
