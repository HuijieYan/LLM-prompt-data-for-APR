### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `apply` method inside the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The `apply` method contains logic to adjust a given datetime based on business hours and days. The bug seems to be related to the calculation of the adjusted datetime.
3. The test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in the `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py` file is failing with a `ValueError`. The error message indicates an issue with the frequency validation, specifically related to the custom business hour frequency (`CBH`).
4. The bug seems to be related to incorrect adjustments made based on the business hours and days when calculating the adjusted datetime.
5. To fix the bug, we need to properly adjust the datetime based on the business hours and days such that it conforms to the custom business hour frequency.

### Modified Corrected Version:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            business_day = BusinessDay()
            custom_hour = CustomBusinessHour(start=self.start, end=self.end, name=self.name)
            adjusted_datetime = other
            if n >= 0:
                for _ in range(n):
                    adjusted_datetime = custom_hour.rollforward(adjusted_datetime)
            else:
                n = abs(n)
                for _ in range(n):
                    adjusted_datetime = custom_hour.rollback(adjusted_datetime)
    
            return adjusted_datetime
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, the adjustments to the datetime are made using the `rollforward` and `rollback` methods of `CustomBusinessHour` to ensure that the adjusted datetime conforms to the custom business hour frequency.
