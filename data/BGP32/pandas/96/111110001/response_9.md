### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `apply` method within the `BusinessHourMixin` class. This method is used to adjust a datetime object according to business hours defined by the class attributes.
2. The error message indicates that there is a frequency mismatch when validating the frequency for a DatetimeIndex.
3. The code is likely failing to adjust the datetime object correctly within business hours, leading to a mismatch with the expected frequency. This could be due to incorrect handling of the business hours and adjustments within the `apply` method.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the datetime object is correctly adjusted within the business hours defined by the class attributes. This involves adjusting the logic for handling business days, business hours, start/end times, adjustments, and time intervals.
5. The corrected version of the `apply` method is provided below.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

            start_time = other.replace(minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
            if n >= 0:
                if start_time.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(start_time):
                    start_time = self._next_opening_time(start_time)
            else:
                if start_time.time() in self.start:
                    start_time = start_time - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(start_time):
                    start_time = self._next_opening_time(start_time)
                    start_time = self._get_closing_time(start_time)

            business_hours_per_day = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) // 60 for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

            total_minutes = abs(n) * 60
            business_days, remaining_minutes = divmod(total_minutes, business_hours_per_day)
            if n < 0:
                business_days, remaining_minutes = -business_days, -remaining_minutes

            complete_days = BusinessDay(n=business_days)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(start_time):
                prev_day_open = self._prev_opening_time(start_time)
                time_difference = start_time - prev_day_open
                start_time = prev_day_open + complete_days + time_difference
            else:
                start_time += complete_days

            remaining_time = timedelta(minutes=remaining_minutes)

            if n >= 0:
                while remaining_time != timedelta(0):
                    business_hour_remaining = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(start_time)) - start_time
                    if business_hour_remaining > remaining_time:
                        start_time += remaining_time
                        remaining_time = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        remaining_time = remaining_time - business_hour_remaining
                        start_time = self._next_opening_time(start_time + business_hour_remaining)
            else:
                while remaining_time != timedelta(0):
                    business_hour_remaining = self._next_opening_time(start_time) - start_time
                    if remaining_time >= business_hour_remaining or (remaining_time == business_hour_remaining and nanosecond != 0):
                        start_time += remaining_time
                        remaining_time = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        remaining_time = remaining_time - business_hour_remaining
                        start_time = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(start_time) - timedelta(seconds=1))

            return start_time
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With these corrections, the `apply` method should now adjust the datetime object correctly within the business hours defined by the class attributes, resolving the frequency mismatch issue in the test case provided.
