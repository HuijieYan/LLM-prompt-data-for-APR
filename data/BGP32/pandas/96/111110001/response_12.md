## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the class `BusinessHourMixin` which extends `BusinessMixin` and contains several other helper functions like `_next_opening_time`, `_get_closing_time`, `_is_on_offset`, etc.
2. The `apply` function is intended to adjust a given datetime based on business hours specified in the class. It handles different cases based on the sign of the input `n` which represents the number of business hours to adjust.
3. The error message indicates a ValueError raised during frequency validation in the test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`. This implies that the output index frequency does not conform to the expected frequency.
4. By inspecting the `apply` function, the bug might be related to how business hours are calculated and adjusted, resulting in incorrect datetime adjustments.

## Bug:
The bug in the `apply` function is causing incorrect adjustments to business hours, leading to a misalignment in the expected frequency when used in test functions like `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.

## Fix:
To fix the bug, several adjustments need to be made in the `apply` function to ensure correct handling of business hours and datetime adjustments. The main focus should be on accurately determining the business hours to adjust and handling cases where the adjustments might be incorrect.

## Corrected Version:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Adjust business hours based on the sign of n
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        
        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = self.next_bday(other) if self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other) else self._prev_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1)
            other = skip_bd.apply(other)

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                next_closing = self._get_closing_time(other)
                bhour = (next_closing - other)  # business hours left in this interval
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(next_closing)
            else:
                next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
                bhour = (next_opening - other)  # business hours left in this interval
                if bhour_remain > bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(next_opening - timedelta(seconds=1))
                
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making the corrections as shown above, the `apply` function should now handle business hour adjustments correctly, aligning with the expected behavior in test functions like `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.
