### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `offsets.py` file. This function is meant to adjust a given datetime based on business hours.
2. The error message indicates a ValueError related to frequency validation when creating a DatetimeIndex.
3. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is trying to use a CustomBusinessHour frequency but encounters a ValueError during index creation.
4. The bug likely lies in how the `apply` function adjusts the datetime by business days and business hours based on the given frequency.
5. The bug is likely causing the adjusted datetime to not align with the CustomBusinessHour frequency, leading to the ValueError during index creation.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect adjustment of the datetime in the `apply` function, leading to the adjusted datetime not conforming to the given CustomBusinessHour frequency. This results in a ValueError during index creation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjusted datetime aligns with the CustomBusinessHour frequency provided. We should review the adjustments made in the `apply` function to guarantee the resulting datetime fits within the specified frequency.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # Adjust the datetime to ensure it aligns with start/end
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() != self.start[0] or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() != self.end[-1]:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Get the total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        
        # Calculate business days and remaining hours
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = other.replace(hour=self.start[0].hour, minute=self.start[0].minute)
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            # Handle business hours left in the day
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                if n >= 0:
                    if other.time() != self.start[0]:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                else:
                    if other.time() != self.end[-1]:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                        other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                    bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                
                if bhour <= bhour_remain:
                    other += bhour
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                else:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

            return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By revising the adjustments in the `apply` function to correctly handle business days and remaining hours, we should be able to ensure that the adjusted datetime aligns with the given CustomBusinessHour frequency, resolving the bug.
