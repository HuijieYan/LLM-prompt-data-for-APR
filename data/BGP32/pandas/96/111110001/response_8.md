### Analysis:
- The buggy function is `apply(self, other)` inside the `BusinessHourMixin` class.
- The related functions called within `apply(self, other)` are `_is_on_offset`, `_next_opening_time`, `_get_closing_time`, `next_bday`, and other helper functions.
- The failing test involves using a `CustomBusinessHour` offset with custom holidays, which triggers the `apply` function, leading to a `ValueError`.
- The error message mentions an issue with inferred frequency not conforming to the passed frequency.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the implementation of the `apply` function not handling custom frequencies correctly. The logic for adjusting the datetime object within `apply(self, other)` may not be considering the custom business hours properly, leading to a frequency validation issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug:
1. Ensure that the custom business hours are taken into account correctly when adjusting the datetime object.
2. Make sure that the logic for business day calculations and adjustments considers the custom frequency defined by `CustomBusinessHour`.
3. Validate the frequency in a way that it conforms to the expected behavior with custom offsets and holidays.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            original_other = other
            
            # adjust the provided datetime based on business hours
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            n = self.n

            if n < 0:
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # adjust by business days first
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = other + skip_bd

            # adjust remaining business hours
            hours_to_add = timedelta(minutes=r)
            while hours_to_add != timedelta(0):
                next_open = self._next_opening_time(other)

                # business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = next_open - other

                if bhour >= hours_to_add:
                    other += hours_to_add
                    break
                else:
                    hours_to_add -= bhour
                    other = next_open

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected version aims to adjust the datetime object correctly based on business hours, taking into account custom frequencies and holidays.
