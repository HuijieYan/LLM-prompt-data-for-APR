### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is supposed to adjust a given datetime `other` based on the business hours defined in the class instance. It handles cases where the adjustment involves moving to the next opening time, adjusting by business days, and adjusting by remaining business hours.
2. The error message indicates a `ValueError` related to frequency validation, suggesting that the adjustment made by the `apply` function is not conforming to the expected frequency format.
3. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is designed to create a date range with custom business hours, but it fails due to the bug in the `apply` function.
4. The bug could be related to how the adjustment calculations are performed in the `apply` function, resulting in an output that is not compatible with the frequency expectations in the test.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments made by the `apply` function are properly aligned with the expected frequency, especially when dealing with custom business hours. This may involve reviewing the adjustment logic, handling edge cases, and ensuring that the final datetime output matches the desired frequency.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to remove timezone information
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None)

        # perform necessary adjustments based on business hours
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # handle business day adjustments
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
        if not self.is_on_offset(other):
            prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            remain = other - prev_open
            other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
        else:
            other += skip_bd

        # remaining business hours adjustments
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
            
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By ensuring that the adjustments are properly aligned with the expected frequency values, the corrected version of the `apply` function should address the `ValueError` issue and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
