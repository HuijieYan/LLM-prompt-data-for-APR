### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which is a subclass of `BusinessMixin`.
2. The function `apply` is trying to apply a business hour offset to a given datetime.
3. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` uses a `CustomBusinessHour` offset as the frequency for generating a date range. The test fails due to a ValueError related to frequency validation.
4. The error message indicates that the inferred frequency from passed values does not conform to the passed frequency CBH (CustomBusinessHour).

### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to be in the way the `apply` function handles the adjustment of business days and hours, resulting in inconsistencies with the given frequency `CustomBusinessHour`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustment of business days and hours in the `apply` function aligns correctly with the given frequency `CustomBusinessHour`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from pandas._libs.tslibs.offsets import BaseOffset, apply_index_wraps

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Reset the timezone and nanosecond
            other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, nanosecond=0)
            n = self.n
            
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
                
            if bd != 0:
                other = self.next_bday.apply(other, bd)
            
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other if n >= 0 else self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other) if n >= 0 else self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            return apply_index_wraps(other, self)
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making these adjustments in the `apply` function, the corrected version should align correctly with the given frequency and pass the failing test.
