### Analysis
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas` library, specifically in the `pandas.tseries.offsets` module.
2. The function takes an input parameter `other` which is expected to be a `datetime` object. It performs various calculations on this datetime object based on the properties of the `BusinessHourMixin` instance.
3. The buggy function is raising an `ApplyTypeError` when the input parameter `other` is not an instance of `datetime`. This error occurs during a test related to custom business hours.
4. The cause of the bug could be related to the way the function is handling the input parameter `other` and the subsequent calculations based on `other`. The error might be due to incorrect handling of the `other` datetime object in certain scenarios.
5. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly processes the `other` datetime object, performs necessary calculations based on the properties of the `BusinessHourMixin` instance, and returns the adjusted datetime object.

### Fix
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessDay
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function should address the bug and allow the function to handle the input datetime objects and perform the required calculations correctly.
