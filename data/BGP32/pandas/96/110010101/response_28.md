## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. The error message indicates a mismatch between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency. This suggests that the function is not correctly adjusting the input datetime object based on business hours.
2. It seems like there might be an issue with the calculations involving business hours and adjustments.
3. The bug may be occurring in the logic where the adjustment of business hours is not accurately calculated, resulting in a mismatch with the provided frequency.
4. The bug fix should correct the calculation of adjustments to align the output with the expected frequency.

## Corrected version of the function:
