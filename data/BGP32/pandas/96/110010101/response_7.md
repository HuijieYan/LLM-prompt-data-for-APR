**Analysis:**

1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The function is supposed to adjust a given `datetime` object based on the business hours specified by the `CustomBusinessHour` object.
3. The error message indicates a `ValueError` is being raised during the test execution.
4. The test case involves creating a date range using a custom business hour frequency, and the validation of the frequency is failing.
5. The error seems to be related to the validation of the custom business hour frequency against the inferred frequency.
6. The expected input/output values provided indicate the expected behavior and values of variables in various test cases.

**Issues:**
1. The error is raised when trying to validate the custom business hour frequency.
2. The error indicates that the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**
1. Revise the `_validate_frequency` method to properly validate the custom business hour frequency.
2. Handle the case where the inferred frequency does not match the passed frequency.
3. Ensure that the validation logic matches the expected behavior specified in the test cases.

**Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:**
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After the fix, ensure to re-run the failing test cases to verify that the corrected function passes all the test cases and meets the expected input/output values.
