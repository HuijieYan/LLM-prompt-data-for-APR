### Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is designed to adjust datetime objects based on custom business hours. The function is trying to handle various edge cases related to business hours, holidays, and weekends. The error message suggests that there is a problem with the frequency validation, specifically around a mismatch between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency. This error occurs inside a `_validate_frequency` method when validating a given frequency against values in a DatetimeArray.

The function needs to adjust the input datetime based on the provided custom business hours. However, there seem to be issues in handling time intervals and adjusting the datetime object accordingly. The main problem seems to be calculating and adjusting business hours properly within the specified business day.

### Bug Identified
The bug lies in the logic where the function tries to adjust remaining business hours within time intervals. The calculations to move to the next business time interval or finish adjusting current business hours are not handling all cases correctly. This leads to an incorrect adjustment and causes the frequency validation error.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to enhance the handling of remaining business hours within the time intervals. The adjustments should correctly calculate the business hours, move to the next interval when needed, and finish adjusting the hours properly.

To improve the function:
1. Review the calculation of business hours and adjust the datetime object accordingly.
2. Ensure that the function properly handles moving to the next business time interval and finishing adjustments within the intervals.
3. Validate the frequency correctly to avoid the error message related to the inferred frequency mismatch.

### Bug-fixed Function
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # Adjust for business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = other + skip_bd

            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                opening_time = self._next_opening_time(other) if n >= 0 else other
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(opening_time) - other if n >= 0 else opening_time - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour) if n >= 0 else self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))
                    bhour_remain -= bhour

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By updating the logic for adjusting remaining business hours within intervals, the bug should be fixed, and the function should now correctly adjust the datetime objects based on the custom business hours.
