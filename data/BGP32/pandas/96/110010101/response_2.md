## Bug Analysis
The buggy function is supposed to adjust a given datetime value based on a set of business hours. The function is designed to handle cases where the adjustment involves moving to the next or previous business hours and days.

The bug occurs when the frequency validation check fails due to an inferred frequency mismatch with the passed frequency. This leads to a ValueError being raised, causing the test to fail.

The buggy function is trying to handle business hours adjustments using a non-standard frequency ('CBH'). This causes a mismatch when validating the frequency with the generated date range, leading to the error.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the frequency used in the function aligns with the standard DateOffset frequency handling in pandas. This can be achieved by converting the 'CBH' frequency to a standard frequency, such as 'H' (hourly frequency).

## Corrected Function
```python
    # this is the corrected function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            if other.freq == 'CBH':
                freq = 'H'
            else:
                freq = other.freq

            other = other.round(freq)
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() >= self.end[0] or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() < self.start[0]:
                    other = other.replace(hour=self.end[0].hour, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0) - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:

                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
                    # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = (
                        self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    )

                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if (
                        bhour_remain > bhour
                        or bhour_remain == bhour
                        and other.nanosecond != 0
                    ):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(
                                other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                            )
                        )
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By converting the frequency to a standard format within the function, we ensure that the adjustments are made correctly without causing a mismatch in the frequency validation.
