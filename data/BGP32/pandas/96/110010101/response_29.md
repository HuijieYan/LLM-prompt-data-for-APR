## Bug Analysis
The buggy function is designed to adjust a given datetime by a specified number of business hours according to the rules defined in the CustomBusinessHour class. The bug seems to lie in the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business hours, leading to the ValueError raised during the test.

### Probable Cause of Bug
The bug may be caused by incorrect adjustments made within the loops that handle the remaining business hours. The error is likely raised due to a mismatch between the inferred frequency from the adjustments made and the specified frequency.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments made to the datetime within the loops properly align with the specified frequency and do not introduce errors that lead to a mismatch. We will need to review and potentially restructure the logic within these adjustment loops to handle the remaining business hours correctly.

## Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = other + skip_bd
    
            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    # business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = (
                        self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    )
                    if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        break
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        break
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(
                                other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                            )
                        )
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version includes adjustments to how the remaining business hours are handled within the loops to ensure that the adjustments are made correctly and aligned with the specified business hours. This should resolve the ValueError raised during the test.
