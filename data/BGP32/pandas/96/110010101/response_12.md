### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is a method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class.
2. The `apply` function is intended to adjust a given datetime object based on custom business hours.
3. The error message indicates a `ValueError` being raised in the `_validate_frequency` method due to a mismatch between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency.
4. The bug is likely related to incorrect handling of the custom business hours within the `apply` function, leading to the mismatch in frequencies.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments made within the `apply` function align with the custom business hours specified.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic in the `apply` function to correctly adjust the datetime object according to the custom business hours.
2. Ensure that the adjustments align with the provided business hours and do not introduce any discrepancies.
3. Handle negative and positive business hour adjustments appropriately to avoid errors.
4. Check the conditions for `n >= 0` and `n < 0` to adjust the time intervals correctly.
5. Verify the adjustments made when moving between business time intervals and align them with the specified business hours.

### Bug Fixed Code:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/tseries/offsets.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            
            n = self.n
            total_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
            
            business_days, remaining_hours = divmod(abs(n * 60), total_hours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                business_days, remaining_hours = -business_days, -remaining_hours
            
            other = self._get_next_time(other, n)
            
            if business_days != 0:
                skip_business_days = BusinessDay(n=business_days)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    remain = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other) + skip_business_days + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_business_days
            
            remaining_time = timedelta(minutes=remaining_hours)
            
            if n >= 0:
                while remaining_time != timedelta(0):
                    current_interval_end = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))
                    interval_hours = current_interval_end - other
                    
                    if remaining_time < interval_hours:
                        other += remaining_time
                        remaining_time = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        remaining_time -= interval_hours
                        other = self._next_opening_time(current_interval_end)
            else:
                while remaining_time != timedelta(0):
                    current_interval_start = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    interval_hours = current_interval_start - other
                    
                    if remaining_time >= interval_hours or (remaining_time == interval_hours and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += remaining_time
                        remaining_time = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        remaining_time -= interval_hours
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(current_interval_start - timedelta(seconds=1)))
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

``` 

By applying the updated logic as outlined above, the bug in the `apply` method should be fixed, and the function should correctly adjust datetime values based on custom business hours without causing a mismatch in frequencies.
