### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is supposed to adjust a given datetime object based on the business hours defined by the `BusinessHourMixin` class. However, the function contains several errors that lead to a `ValueError` during the validation of a frequency compatible with the values of a given Datetime Array/Index.

The buggy function fails to correctly adjust the datetime object based on the specified business hours, resulting in incorrect calculations and ultimately causing the failure during frequency validation.

### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function fails to correctly adjust the datetime object when calculating the remaining business hours (`bhour_remain`) and handling the scenario where the adjustment involves moving to the next business time interval for negative `n` values. This leads to incorrect calculations and causes the function to return incorrect values, triggering the error during validation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the adjustment for business days (`skip_bd`) is correctly applied before handling the remaining business hours.
2. Improve the handling of negative `n` values to correctly adjust the datetime object for previous business days.
3. Check the calculation of remaining business hours to ensure that the adjustment is properly accounted for in each iteration.

### Updated Function (Bug-Fixed):
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
            
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            other = self._next_opening_time(other) if n >= 0 and other.time() in self.end else other
            other = other - timedelta(seconds=1) if n < 0 and other.time() in self.start else other
            other = self._next_opening_time(other) if n < 0 and not self._is_on_offset(other) else other
            other = self._get_closing_time(other) if n < 0 else other
                
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            bd, r = -bd, -r if n < 0 else bd, r
            
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self._next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    other += min(bhour, bhour_remain)
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1))
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By applying the fixes mentioned above, the bug in the `apply` function should be resolved, allowing it to correctly adjust datetime objects based on the defined business hours, and pass the failing test cases successfully.
