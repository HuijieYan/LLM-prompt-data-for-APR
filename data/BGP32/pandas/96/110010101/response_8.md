### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class.
2. The function is intended to adjust a given datetime based on business hours and holidays.
3. The error message indicates a `ValueError` is raised during frequency validation, specifically due to the inferred frequency not conforming to the passed frequency.
4. The bug likely arises from a discrepancy in inferred frequency and passed frequency when dealing with custom business hours, causing the validation to fail.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the inferred frequency matches the specified frequency, `CBH` (Custom Business Hour).

### Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, we will modify the function to handle custom business hours appropriately and ensure the frequencies align correctly.

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
            
            result = other
            for _ in range(abs(bd)):
                if n < 0:
                    result = self._prev_opening_time(result) - timedelta(seconds=1)
                else:
                    result = self._next_opening_time(result)
                    
            if r != 0:
                if n < 0:
                    result = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(result))
                while r > 0:
                    bhour = (
                        self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(result)) - result
                    )
                    if r >= bhour.seconds // 60:
                        result += bhour
                        r -= bhour.seconds // 60
                    else:
                        result += timedelta(minutes=r)
                        r = 0
            elif r < 0:
                result = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(result))

            return result
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By implementing this modification, we adjust the given datetime according to the specified custom business hours and resolve the frequency validation issue.
