### Analysis
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class has several issues. It appears that the main problem lies in how the business hours are being calculated and adjusted. Additionally, the function is not handling certain edge cases correctly, leading to errors in frequency validation when used in a different context.

1. The function is supposed to adjust a given datetime object based on custom business hours. The expected behavior involves considering the start and end times of the business hours, as well as the number of business days (n) to adjust by.

2. The code logic for adjusting the datetime object seems convoluted and prone to errors, especially in scenarios where business hours cross over multiple days or involve holidays.

3. The error message in the failing test related to frequency validation suggests that there is an issue when trying to compare the inferred frequency with the expected frequency. This points to potential errors in how the adjustments are being made, resulting in frequencies that are not valid.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `apply` function, we need to simplify the logic for adjusting the datetime object based on business hours. Additionally, we need to ensure that the adjustments are made correctly for different scenarios, including handling cases where business hours span multiple days or involve holidays.

1. We should refactor the code to improve readability and maintainability.
2. We need to correctly handle cases where business hours extend beyond a single day or involve holidays.
3. Make sure that the frequency validation is performed correctly to avoid errors when creating date ranges with custom business hours.

### Bug-fixed Function
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if not isinstance(other, datetime):
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
        
        adjusted_time = self.adjust_datetime(other)
        return adjusted_time

    def adjust_datetime(self, dt):
        n_hours = self.calculate_business_hours(dt)

        # Handle forward or backward adjustments based on n_hours
        adjusted_time = dt + timedelta(hours=n_hours)

        return adjusted_time

    def calculate_business_hours(self, dt):
        total_business_hours = sum(
            self.get_business_hours_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        n_hours = self.n * 60 * 60
        adjusted_hours, _ = divmod(abs(n_hours), total_business_hours // 3600)

        if n_hours < 0:
            adjusted_hours *= -1

        return adjusted_hours
```

The refactored code separates the adjustment logic into a new method `adjust_datetime` and simplifies the calculation of business hours. This should ensure more robust handling of adjusting datetimes based on business hours. Make sure to test the corrected function with the provided test cases to verify its correctness.
