## Bug Analysis
The buggy function is intended to adjust a given timestamp based on business hours and the specified business schedule. The function seems to correctly handle adjustments for positive and negative `n` values (indicating future or past business hours) by adjusting the timestamp accordingly. However, there is a logical error causing the function to fail in certain cases, leading to a `ValueError`.

The primary cause of the bug is observed in the adjustment logic within the while loops for both positive and negative `n` values. The error arises when handling the remaining business hours adjustment (`bhour_remain`) within each business time interval, potentially leading to incorrect adjustments and violating the intended business hour scheduling.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to reassess how the remaining business hours are adjusted within each business time interval in the while loops. It is crucial to ensure that the adjustments are correctly calculated to respect the business hour schedule and the direction of adjustment specified by `n`.

We should thoroughly review the calculation mechanism within the while loops, paying specific attention to the conditions determining the movement between various business time intervals and the correct application of business hours adjustments.

## Bug-fixed Function
Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        current_interval = self._next_opening_time(other) if n >= 0 else self._get_closing_time(other)
        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
            bhour = current_interval - other if n >= 0 else other - current_interval

            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain if n >= 0 else -bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(current_interval) if n >= 0 else self._get_closing_time(current_interval)
                current_interval = self._next_opening_time(other) if n >= 0 else self._get_closing_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version addresses the logical error in the adjustment of remaining business hours within each business time interval. It ensures that the adjustments respect the business hour schedule and correctly handle the direction of adjustments based on the positive or negative `n` value. The function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values outlined.
