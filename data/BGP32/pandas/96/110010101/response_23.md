## Analysis
The buggy function `apply` in the class `BusinessHourMixin` is designed to adjust a given `datetime` object based on business hours. The function checks if the input is a `datetime`, modifies the input time to the closest business hour, calculates the business hours between start and end times, and adjusts the input time accordingly.

The error message indicates a `ValueError` being raised during the validation of the frequency. This error is triggered due to a mismatch between the inferred frequency and the provided custom business hour frequency.

The potential error locations in the code are:
1. The adjustment of the frequency in the `cls._validate_frequency` method.
2. The calculation and adjustment of the `other` time within the `apply` method.

The cause of the bug is that the inferred frequency from the input index does not match the provided custom business hour frequency, leading to the `ValueError` being raised.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the inferred frequency matches the custom business hour frequency provided. This can be achieved by adjusting the frequency validation logic in the `cls._validate_frequency` method to check for the specific custom business hour frequency.

Additionally, any adjustments made to the input time `other` should consider the custom business hour frequency to correctly align the time with the business hours.

## Bug Fix

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Check if the provided frequency matches the custom business hour frequency
            if not other.freq.freqstr == self.freqstr:
                raise ValueError(f'Inferred frequency {other.freq.freqstr} from passed values does not match custom business hour frequency {self.freqstr}')
            
            # Perform adjustments based on business hours
            n = self.n
            other = other.floor("min")

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=60)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # Adjust business days and hours
            adjusted_time = self.get_adjusted_time(other, n)

            return adjusted_time
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By checking for the frequency match and adjusting the time appropriately, the above fix should resolve the `ValueError` issue that was previously encountered.
