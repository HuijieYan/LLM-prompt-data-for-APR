### Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class and is responsible for applying business hour offsets to datetimes. The function seems to be incorrectly adjusting the input `other` datetime value based on the business hour rules defined by the attributes of the `self` object.

The error message indicates a `ValueError` being raised during the validation of the frequency, which suggests that the adjustments made in the function might be incorrect, leading to unexpected results.

The expected input values include a `Timestamp` object for `other`, integer values for year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and microsecond of the `other` timestamp, and other related attributes of the `self` object. The expected output should be a modified `other` datetime after applying the business hour offset.

### Bug
The bug is likely related to the incorrect handling of adjustments in the `apply` function. It seems that the adjustments to the `other` datetime instance may not align correctly with the business hour rules, leading to invalid business hour calculations and ultimately causing a `ValueError` during frequency validation.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments made to the `other` datetime instance are consistent with the defined business hour rules. Specifically, we should check the handling of negative offsets, adjustment to business days, and remaining business hours for correctness.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() >= self.end[0] or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() <= self.start[0]:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1)

        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
            else:
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)

            if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                other += bhour
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + timedelta(seconds=-1))
            else:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version addresses the potential issues in the original `apply` function and should pass the failing test cases with the expected input/output values.
