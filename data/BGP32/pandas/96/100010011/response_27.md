### Analysis:
The error message indicates a `ValueError` being raised during a validation process regarding frequency compatibility with a given Datetime Index. The error seems to be related to the mismatch between the inferred frequency and the provided frequency when working with custom business hours and holidays.

### Error:
The buggy function `apply` in `offsets.py` does not correctly handle the adjustment of business days and business hours when combining with datetime objects. This leads to the erroneous behavior observed in the `date_range` function, causing unexpected periods to be generated when holidays are involved.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the frequencies inferred from the index match the passed frequency, considering custom business hours and holidays.
2. Adjust the adjustments for business days and business hours to correctly handle cases involving holidays and edge conditions.
3. Properly validate and adjust the behavior depending on the provided frequency information.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # ensure normalized datetime
        other = datetime(
            other.year, other.month, other.day, other.hour, other.minute, other.second, other.microsecond
        )
        
        original_other = other  # store the original datetime for adjustments
        
        n = self.n
        if n >= 0 or other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            other = self._prev_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1)

        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_days = BusinessDay(n=bd, holidays=self._holidays)
            other = other + skip_days

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            offset = self._get_offset(other)
            bhour = offset - other

            if n >= 0:
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(offset)
            else:
                if bhour_remain > bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = offset - timedelta(seconds=1)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected function enhances the adjustment logic for business days and hours, considering holidays and edge cases. By making these adjustments, the function should now be able to properly handle the provided scenarios and ensure correct frequency validation within `date_range`.
