### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` in the `pandas.tseries.offsets` module.
2. The error message indicates a `ValueError` raised during frequency validation in the `DatetimeIndex` creation process.
3. The GitHub issue describes a similar scenario where using `periods` along with holidays in `pd.date_range` results in unexpected behavior: more periods generated than expected.
4. The bug seems to be related to how the business hours are adjusted when considering holidays while generating the date range.
5. The issue arises due to an incorrect adjustment in business days calculation and handling when holidays are involved.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to incorrect business days adjustment logic when holidays are present. The function `apply` fails to properly handle holidays while adjusting business days, leading to a mismatch in the number of generated periods.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic for adjusting business days in the presence of holidays.
2. Incorporate proper handling of holidays during the adjustment process.
3. Ensure that the adjustment preserves the correct number of periods without overshooting.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if other.time() in self.start:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        elif other.time() in self.end:
            other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        else:
            if other in self.onOffset(other):
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        n = self.n

        business_hours_seconds = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(start, end)
            for start, end in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        
        business_days, remaining_seconds = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours_seconds // 60)

        if n < 0:
            business_days, remaining_seconds = -business_days, -remaining_seconds
        
        if business_days != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=business_days)
            if on_offset(other):
                other += skip_bd
            else:
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remaining = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remaining

        remaining_td = timedelta(seconds=remaining_seconds)

        if n >= 0:
            while remaining_td != timedelta(0):
                b_hour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if remaining_td < b_hour:
                    other += remaining_td
                    remaining_td = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    remaining_td -= b_hour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + b_hour)
        else:
            while remaining_td != timedelta(0):
                b_hour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if remaining_td >= b_hour:
                    other += remaining_td
                    remaining_td = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    remaining_td -= b_hour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Now, the corrected function should handle holidays properly and adjust business days accordingly to generate the correct number of periods without issues.
