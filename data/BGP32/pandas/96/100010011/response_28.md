### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is a method within a pandas library (specifically `pandas/tseries/offsets.py`) and is related to custom business hours within the DateOffset functionality.
2. The error message is related to validating the frequency of a DateOffset in a DatetimeIndex or TimedeltaIndex context.
3. The error occurs when the inferred frequency does not match the passed frequency while generating a date range.
4. The bug is triggered by passing custom business hours with holidays, causing the validation to fail.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the interaction of custom business hours with holidays, leading to an incorrect validation of frequencies when generating a date range. The code fails to handle non-fixed frequencies properly in the presence of holidays, resulting in a ValueError.

### Recommendation for Fix:
To address this issue, the custom business hour offset handling regarding holidays and frequency validation needs to be improved. Ensuring that the frequency inference and the provided frequency align correctly is crucial for consistent date range generation.

### Updated Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Original logic content to handle business hours
        ...

        # New code to validate frequency
        if not isinstance(self, CustomBusinessHour):
            return self

        inferred = other.inferred_freq
        if other.size == 0 or inferred is None or inferred.freqstr == self.freq.freqstr:
            return other
        raise ValueError(f"Inferred frequency {inferred} from passed values does not match target frequency {self.freq.freqstr}")

    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### The updated function now includes logic to verify and compare frequencies correctly when dealing with custom business hours. This adjustment should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test.
