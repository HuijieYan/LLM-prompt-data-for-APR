### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply(self, other)` in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is failing due to an issue with the validation of the frequency when using `pd.date_range`.
2. The error message indicates a `ValueError` being raised during the validation of frequency compatibility.
3. The provided source code seems to have issues handling the frequency validation for `CustomBusinessHour` offsets.
4. The error occurs when the inferred frequency from passed values does not conform to the passed frequency.
5. The GitHub issue provides a scenario where adding holidays to a `CustomBusinessHour` offset causes unexpected behavior in `pd.date_range`.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the function `apply(self, other)` does not correctly handle the frequency validation for `CustomBusinessHour` offsets.
- The validation logic inside the function is not properly comparing the inferred frequency with the passed frequency.
- This leads to a mismatch in frequencies and raises a `ValueError`.

### Fix Strategy:
- Update the validation logic to properly compare the inferred frequency with the passed frequency for `CustomBusinessHour` offsets.
- Ensure that the frequency validation checks whether the inferred frequency matches the passed frequency, and raise a `ValueError` if they do not match.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        inferred = self._infer_daily_frequency(other)
        if inferred != self:
            raise ValueError(f"Inferred frequency {inferred} from passed values does not conform to passed frequency {self}")
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

def _infer_daily_frequency(self, other):
    frequency = CustomBusinessHour()
    for attr in ['start', 'end', 'n']:
        if getattr(self, attr) != getattr(frequency, attr):
            return None
    return frequency
```

### Updated Analysis:
- The corrected function now properly compares the inferred frequency with the passed frequency.
- The new method `_infer_daily_frequency(self, other)` is added to handle inferring the daily frequency based on the inputs.
- If the inferred frequency does not match the passed `CustomBusinessHour` frequency, a `ValueError` is raised.
- This change should resolve the frequency validation issue reported in the GitHub bug and allow `pd.date_range` to work correctly with `CustomBusinessHour` offsets.
