### Analysis
The error message points to a validation issue related to the frequency when using `pd.date_range` with a custom business hour offset and holidays. The `ValueError` is raised during frequency validation for the `DatetimeArray`.

### Error Cause
The bug is likely in the implementation of the `apply` function within the `CustomBusinessHour` class that may not handle all cases correctly when combining business hours with datetime objects.

The issue is likely due to the handling of the frequency calculation, especially when dealing with holidays, which leads to incorrect validation of the inferred frequency against the passed frequency.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the issue, we need to adjust the `apply` function to correctly handle business hour offsets and consider holidays in the frequency calculation logic.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Validate frequency correctness with business hour offset and holidays
        if self._is_on_offset(other):  # Check if datetime is on offset
            return other

        # Get the total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        
        # Adjust other to the next valid business time based on offset
        other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        # Handle business day adjustments
        bd, r = divmod(self.n * 60, businesshours // 60)
        
        skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
        other += skip_bd
        
        # Handle remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = r * 60
        
        while bhour_remain != 0:
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            if bhour_remain < bhour.total_seconds():
                other += timedelta(seconds=bhour_remain)
                break
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour.total_seconds()
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function should resolve the frequency validation issue related to adding holidays while using a custom business hour offset, as reported in the GitHub issue.
