### Analysis:
The bug occurs due to the mismatch in inferred frequency and the passed frequency when using `pd.date_range` with a custom business hour frequency and holidays. This leads to the validation check raising a `ValueError` due to the mismatch between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function `apply` in the offsets.py file incorrectly handles the `Freq` validation by not properly checking and throwing the error, leading to the issue when using `pd.date_range`.

### Fix Strategy:
The fix involves updating the `apply` function to properly handle the adjustment of `other` instances with a datetime object. When encountering the case of adding holidays to the frequency, ensure that the inferred frequency and the passed frequency match to avoid the validation error.

### Corrected Implementation:
Below is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # removed several lines for clarity

        if index.size == 0 or inferred == freq.freqstr:
            return None

        try:
            on_freq = cls._generate_range(
                start=index[0], end=None, periods=len(index), freq=freq, **kwargs
            )
            if not np.array_equal(index.asi8, on_freq.asi8):
                raise ValueError
        except ValueError as e:
            if "non-fixed" in str(e):
                raise e
            # Correct the message when frequency inference does not match the passed frequency
            raise ValueError(f"Inferred frequency {inferred} does not match passed frequency {freq.freqstr}")

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should address the issue when using `pd.date_range` with a custom business hour frequency and holidays, ensuring the validation of frequency compatibility between inferred and passed values.
