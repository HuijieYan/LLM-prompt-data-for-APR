### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is not handling the case of custom business hours with holidays properly. The error message from the failing test shows that there is an issue with frequency validation when dealing with a custom business hour that includes holidays.

The GitHub issue also points out a similar problem where `pd.date_range` does not work as expected when using periods and adding holidays to a custom business hour. This inconsistency in behavior confirms the problem with frequency validation.

### Error Identification:
The error occurs when `pd.date_range` is used with a custom business hour containing holidays, leading to unexpected periods in the output due to improper handling of holidays.

### Bug Cause:
The `apply` function is not correctly validating the frequency when holidays are included in the custom business hour. This results in divergent behavior during frequency generation, leading to an incorrect number of periods in the output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `apply` function to properly handle the scenario of custom business hours with holidays.
2. Improve frequency validation by considering holidays when generating the frequency range.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Business hour adjustments with holidays
        if not self._is_on_offset(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        if not self._apply_on_offset(other):
            raise ApplyTypeError("Datetime is not on the offset")

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By updating the `apply` function to handle holidays and frequency validation properly, the issue with unexpected periods while using `pd.date_range` with custom business hours should be resolved.
