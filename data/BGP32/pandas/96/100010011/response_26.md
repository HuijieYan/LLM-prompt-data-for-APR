### Analysis:
The buggy function is `apply` within the `CustomBusinessHour` class, which is responsible for applying business hours offsets to datetime objects. The error message indicates a ValueError being raised during frequency validation when generating a date range with custom business hours including holidays.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition checks in the `apply` function that modify the `other` datetime object based on the offset.
2. Calculation and adjustment of business hours and days in the `apply` function.
3. Handling of different scenarios for positive and negative offsets.

### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to stem from improper handling of date validation with custom business hours including holidays when creating a date range. The issue arises due to shortcomings in adjusting the frequency for business hours with holidays.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the logic to adjust the datetime object `other` correctly for both positive and negative offsets.
2. Ensure proper validation and adjustment of business hours and business days.
3. Address the specific issue related to holidays in the frequency validation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
   if isinstance(other, datetime):  
       if other.time() in self.start and self._is_on_offset(other):
           return other
       
       if other.time() not in self.end:
           other = self._next_opening_time(other)
           if not self._is_on_offset(other):
               other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
       n = self.n
       businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
       total_secs = n * 60 * businesshours // 60
       
       bd, r = divmod(abs(total_secs), businesshours // 60)
       if n < 0:
           bd, r = -bd, -r
       
       skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
       if bd != 0:
           other = other + skip_bd
           
       bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
       interval_start = self._prev_opening_time(other) if n >= 0 else other
       
       while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
           next_time = self._next_opening_time(interval_start)
           bhour = next_time - interval_start if n >= 0 else interval_start - next_time
           
           if bhour_remain >= bhour:
               bhour_remain -= bhour
               interval_start = next_time + timedelta(0) if n >= 0 else next_time - timedelta(seconds=1)
           else:
               other = interval_start + bhour_remain
               break
       
       return other
   else:
       raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, adjustments are made to correctly handle different offset scenarios, including holidays, ensuring that the date calculation aligns with business hours. This should address the issue reported on GitHub.
