### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is causing the error message related to validating frequency in a DatetimeArray. The error message is triggered in the test related to custom holidays and date_range generation.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The logic within the `apply` function for handling business days, business hours, and offsets.
2. The adjustment calculations and conditions within the function.
3. The conversion of `other` to a datetime object which may not handle all cases properly.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug causes the datetime range validation to fail as the inferred frequency from passed values does not conform to the passed frequency for CustomBusinessHour (CBH). This occurs due to inconsistencies in adjusting the dates based on holidays and business hours.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that adjustments for business days, business hours, and holiday handling are correctly performed.
2. Validate the logic for adjusting dates based on the given business hours and holidays.
3. Address the conversion of `other` to a datetime object to retain all necessary information.
4. Ensure that the number of periods or the end date generated matches the desired frequency based on business hours and holidays.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from datetime import timedelta
from pandas.tseries.offset import ApplyTypeError, CustomBusinessHour, BusinessDay

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        curr_date = other
        n = self.n

        # Handle non-business hours and holidays
        if n >= 0:
            while curr_date.time() not in self.start:
                curr_date = self._next_opening_time(curr_date)
        else:
            while curr_date.time() not in self.end:
                if curr_date.time() in self.start:
                    # Move to previous business day if needed
                    curr_date -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                curr_date = self._next_opening_time(curr_date)
                curr_date = self._get_closing_time(curr_date)

        # Calculate total business hours in a day
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # Remaining business hours adjustment
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                
            if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                other += bhour
                bhour_remain -= bhour
            else:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With these adjustments in the code, the corrected version aims to properly handle the adjustment of dates based on business hours and holidays, ensuring that the generated datetime range aligns with the desired frequency.
