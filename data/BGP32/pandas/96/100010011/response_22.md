### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is a method that is supposed to adjust the given timestamp based on the business hour offset specified. The function aims to adjust the timestamp by business days and remaining business hours based on the provided offset.
2. The error message shows a `ValueError` being raised in the `_validate_frequency` method of the `DatetimeArray` class when the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency `CBH`. This error occurs during the testing of date range with custom holidays.
3. The bug likely originates from incorrect handling of holiday constraints within the business hour offset adjustment, causing an incorrect number of periods to be generated when holidays are present.
4. To fix the bug, the adjustment logic for holidays should be revised to account for the presence of holidays properly and adjust the timestamps accordingly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Identify the section of the `apply` function responsible for handling holidays and adjust it accordingly to handle the offset adjustment correctly in the presence of holidays.
2. Ensure that the adjustment logic considers the holiday constraints while calculating business days and hours.
3. Updating the logic to adjust timestamps based on the specified offset and include proper handling of holidays to avoid the `ValueError` during frequency validation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import ApplyTypeError, BusinessDay
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if self._has_holidays:
            # Skipping holidays in the date range
            while other in self._holidays_list:
                if n >= 0:
                    other += timedelta(days=1)
                else:
                    other -= timedelta(days=1)

        # Adjust for business days
        if n != 0:
            skip_days = BusinessDay(n=n)
            other += skip_days
        
        # Adjust for remaining business hours
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) // 3600 for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        total_minutes = abs(n) * 60
        bd, r = divmod(total_minutes, businesshours)

        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if r != 0:
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        break
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
            else:
                while bhour_remain < timedelta(0):
                    bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    if abs(bhour_remain) <= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        break
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other - bhour)
                    bhour_remain += bhour
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected version of the function includes adjustments to properly handle holidays during timestamp adjustments based on the provided business hour offset. This revision ensures that the function correctly adjusts timestamps considering holidays, potentially resolving the issue described in the GitHub post.
