### Analysis:
The error message indicates a `ValueError` being raised during the validation of the frequency for a `DatetimeIndex`. The issue on GitHub points out that when using the `periods` parameter along with holidays in `pd.date_range`, the function produces more than the expected number of periods.

### Error Cause:
The buggy function `apply` contains logic to adjust timestamps based on business hours, but it fails to handle properly the case when adjusting timestamps with holidays present, leading to unexpected results when calculating business hours.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `apply` function to handle holidays properly when adjusting the timestamps based on business hours. The adjustment logic should take holidays into account to ensure the correct number of periods is generated.

### Correction:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function that properly handles holidays:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if isinstance(self, CustomBusinessHour):
            n = self.n
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = CustomBusinessHour(n=bd, start=self.start, end=self.end, holidays=self.holidays)
                other += skip_bd

            while r != 0:
                if n > 0:
                    next_hour = self._get_next_closing_hour(other) + timedelta(minutes=r)
                    if apply_index_wraps(other, next_hour):
                        other = next_hour
                    else:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(next_hour)
                else:
                    prev_hour = self._get_prev_opening_hour(other) - timedelta(minutes=r)
                    if apply_index_wraps(other, prev_hour):
                        other = prev_hour
                    else:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(prev_hour)
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Make sure to replace the existing `apply` function with this corrected version in the `offsets.py` file. This corrected version includes proper handling of holidays while adjusting the timestamps based on business hours.
