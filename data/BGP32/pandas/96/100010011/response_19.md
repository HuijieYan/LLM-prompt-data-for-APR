### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` within the provided code snippet is intended to process a DateOffset function to combine it with a given datetime object, such as Timestamp. The error message indicates a ValueError being raised during frequency validation, specifically due to non-conformity between inferred frequency and the passed frequency, leading to the test failure.

### Issues in the Buggy Function:
1. The logic for adjusting business days and hours seems to have inconsistencies that could lead to incorrect processing.
2. The handling of business hours within business time intervals is error-prone and does not seem to be working correctly.
3. The comparison and adjustment of business hours remaining appear to be causing the issue with frequency validation.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function fails to handle the adjustment of business days and business hours correctly, leading to non-conformity between inferred frequency and the passed frequency when validating the frequency. This discrepancy results in a ValueError being raised.

### Suggested Fix Strategy:
1. Review and correct the logic for adjusting business days and business hours to ensure accurate calculations.
2. Verify the handling of business hours within business time intervals for correctness.
3. Modify the comparison and adjustment of business hours remaining to avoid causing the frequency validation error.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if getattr(other, "time") is not None:
            other = other.replace(
                hour=other.hour, minute=other.minute, second=other.second
            )
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                while True:
                    if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    else:
                        break
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for (st, en) in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Outcome:
The corrected version of the `apply` function should now handle the adjustment of business days and business hours accurately, resolving the frequency validation error and enabling the function to pass the failing test case.
