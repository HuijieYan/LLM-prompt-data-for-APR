### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` from the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The error message indicates a `ValueError` being raised during frequency validation in the `_validate_frequency` method.
3. The issue on GitHub relates to unexpected behavior when using holidays in combination with periods in the `pd.date_range` function.
4. The bug occurs due to discrepancies in the inferred frequency and the passed frequency.
5. The bug can be fixed by modifying how the frequencies are handled in the `apply` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the inferred frequency matches the specified frequency.
2. Handle the presence of holidays when determining the range of dates to avoid exceeding the desired number of periods.

### Bug Fix - Corrected Version:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if "holidays" in self.kwds:
            holidays = self.kwds.get("holidays")
            holidays = pd.to_datetime(holidays)
        else:
            holidays = []

        n = self.n
        holiday_adjusted = 0

        while n != 0:
            other += BDay(n, holidays=holidays)
            if other in holidays:
                holiday_adjusted = other
                n += 1 if n > 0 else -1
            
        return holiday_adjusted
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Modified Version Explanation:
1. The corrected code handles adjustments for holidays separately.
2. It uses a `while` loop to adjust the date with `BDay` (business day) considering holidays.
3. The loop increments or decrements `n` based on whether the adjusted date falls on a holiday.
4. This approach ensures that the desired number of periods is maintained even when holidays impact the sequence.
5. By making these adjustments, the corrected function will align with the expected behavior of the `pd.date_range` function.
