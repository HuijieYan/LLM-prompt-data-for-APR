### Analysis:
The provided error message indicates that the issue is related to validating the frequency when generating a date range with custom business hours. The code fails to handle the case where holidays are provided, resulting in an incorrect number of periods in the returned date range.

### Potential Error Location:
The error seems to be originating from the `_validate_frequency` method when `freq` is provided with holidays. It raises a `ValueError` when the frequency inferred from the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to the discrepancy in handling holidays within the date range function that utilizes custom business hours. The code fails to adjust the date range properly when holidays are considered.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the code accounts for holidays correctly when generating the date range using custom business hours. This involves updating the logic to handle cases where holidays are provided and adjust the date range accordingly.

### Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function to address the bug:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Existing code remains as it is
        
        if isinstance(self, CustomBusinessHour) and self.holidays:
            while other in self.holidays:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + timedelta(days=1))
        
        if self.normalize:
            other = as_datetime(other)
        
        # The rest of the existing code follows here
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By incorporating the logic to handle holidays within the `apply` function, the corrected code ensures that the date range generation accounts for holidays properly when using custom business hours. This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to generating incorrect date ranges when holidays are included.
