### Analysis:
The bug is likely related to the frequency validation occurring in the `_validate_frequency` method. The error message states that the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency `CBH`. This issue arises when adding holidays, causing more periods to be generated than expected.

### Potential Error Locations:
- Incorrect handling of holidays within the frequency validation can lead to unexpected behavior in generating periods.
- The `apply` function manipulation of time intervals based on holidays may not be correctly aligning with the frequency setting.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by a discrepancy between the inferred frequency from the passed values and the frequency set explicitly with holidays. This leads to more periods generated than expected due to incorrect alignment with the holiday timings.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Ensure that the handling of holidays in the frequency-related functions is accurate.
- Validate the logic for adjusting dates based on holidays to prevent incorrect period generation.
- Check for any errors in aligning the frequency settings with the provided holidays.

### Corrected Version:

I have modified the `apply` function to better handle the adjustment of dates based on holidays and ensure correct period generation. Here is the corrected version:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if hasattr(self, '_holidays') and isinstance(self._holidays, list):
            for holiday in self._holidays:
                if other.date() == holiday:
                    raise ValueError(f"Holiday {holiday} is not a business day")
        
        if not self.on_offset(other):
            if self.n >= 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                other = self._prev_closing_time(other)

        total_seconds = sum((e - s).seconds for s, e in zip(self.start, self.end))
        n_seconds = self.n * total_seconds

        if n_seconds < 0:
            other -= timedelta(seconds=-n_seconds % total_seconds)
        else:
            other += timedelta(seconds=n_seconds % total_seconds)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should address the holiday-related frequency validation issue and ensure that the period generation aligns correctly with the provided holidays.
