### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates that the `ValueError` is raised due to a mismatch between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency `CBH`.
2. The bug is located in the `apply` function of the `CustomBusinessHour` class within the buggy file.
3. The bug stems from the way the adjustments to the datetime are made within the `apply` function, leading to an incorrect frequency inference.
4. A strategy to fix the bug involves adjusting the datetime in such a way that the correct frequency is preserved which will avoid raising the `ValueError`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `apply` function of the `CustomBusinessHour` class to handle the adjustments while still maintaining the correct frequency. Below is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        n = self.n

        # adjust `other` to the next opening hours based on the current frequencies
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(minutes=1)  # Adjust to previous business hour
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)  # Adjust to closing time

        # Adjust by business days first if necessary
        if n != 0:
            other += BusinessHour(n=n)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, adjustments are made to the datetime object based on the specified business hour offsets. This should maintain the correct frequencies and avoid raising the `ValueError` seen in the failed test.

After applying this fix, the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved, and the corrected function should pass the failing test.
