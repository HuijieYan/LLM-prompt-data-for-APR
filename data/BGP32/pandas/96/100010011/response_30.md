### Potential Error Locations:
1. The function `apply` might not be handling the holidays correctly when adjusting the dates.
2. There could be an issue with the comparison between `index.asi8` and `on_freq.asi8`.

### Bug Cause:
The error message indicates a failure in validating the frequency with the given index. Specifically, the issue arises from the comparison between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency. This is due to incorrect handling of holidays within the `apply` function when adjusting the business hours.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that holidays are considered when adjusting the dates in the `apply` function.
2. Correctly validate the frequency considering holidays to align the inferred frequency with the passed frequency.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace

                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = (

                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:

                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                # business hour left in this business time interval

                    or bhour_remain == bhour
                    and nanosecond != 0

                            other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                        )
                    )

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```  

By incorporating adjustments for holidays within the `apply` function, the corrected version should resolve the issue related to the frequency validation in the tests.
