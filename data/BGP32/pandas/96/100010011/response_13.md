### Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is responsible for combining business hours with datetime objects. The error message indicates a `ValueError` being raised in the `_validate_frequency` method stemming from a mismatch in the inferred frequency from passed values and the specified frequency (`CBH` in this case). This issue is causing problems when trying to create a `DatetimeIndex` using `pd.date_range` with custom business hours and holidays, leading to unexpected behavior as described in the GitHub issue.

### Error Cause
The error occurs due to the function `apply` not handling the case when applying business hours with holidays, leading to an incorrect comparison between the inferred frequency and the specified frequency, resulting in a `ValueError`. This discrepancy prevents the creation of a valid `DatetimeIndex`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function `apply` needs to be updated to properly handle the combination of business hours with holidays. This involves adjusting the logic to consider holidays in the calculation of the new datetime object when combining it with business hours.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if self.on_offset(other):
            return other

        n = self.n
        other = as_datetime(other)
        
        if n >= 0 and other.time() not in self.start:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        elif n < 0 and other.time() in self.start:
            prev_day_opening = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            other = prev_day_opening - timedelta(seconds=1)
        
        business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            if np.isnan(other) or not self.on_offset(other):
                other = other.normalize()
                prev_day_opening = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_day_opening
                other = prev_day_opening + pd.offsets.BusinessDay(n=bd) + remain
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Make sure to update the function according to this corrected version.
