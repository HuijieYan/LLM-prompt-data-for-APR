### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class of the `pandas.tseries.offsets` file is responsible for adjusting a given timestamp based on business hour offsets. It involves complex calculations related to business days, business hours, and adjusting timestamps accordingly.
2. The buggy function seems to have issues with correctly adjusting timestamps when holidays are involved, leading to unexpected results.
3. The failing test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in the test file `pandas.tests.indexes.datetimes.test_date_range` highlights the issue when using custom business hours with holidays, resulting in more periods than expected.
4. The expected output values for different cases involve adjustments to the timestamp based on the specified business hours and holidays.
5. The GitHub issue suggests a related problem with utilizing `pd.date_range` with custom business hours and holidays, resulting in unexpected behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function does not handle adjustments related to holidays appropriately, leading to incorrect timestamp adjustments and unexpected results during date range generation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic inside the `apply` function to correctly adjust timestamps considering holidays for consistent behavior.
2. Ensure that the adjustments for business days and hours are done accurately within the context of holidays to produce the expected results.

### Bug-fixed version of the `apply` function:
```python
@property
def holidays(self):
    return _to_dt64(self._holidays)

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # retrieve holidays as numpy.datetime64 objects
        holidays = self.holidays
        if isinstance(other, pd.Timestamp):
            other = other.to_pydatetime()

        if holidays is None or other not in holidays:
            if self._is_on_offset(other):
                return other

        n = self.n
        if n < 0:
            n += 1

        # calculate the number of business hours in a day
        business_hours_per_day = self._get_business_hours_by_sec(self.start, self.end)

        abs_n_minutes = abs(n) * 60
        business_days, remaining_minutes = divmod(abs_n_minutes, business_hours_per_day // 60)
        
        adjusted_timestamp = other

        if n < 0:
            remaining_minutes = -remaining_minutes
            business_days = -business_days

        if remaining_minutes != 0:
            remaining_timedelta = timedelta(minutes=remaining_minutes)
            while remaining_timedelta != timedelta(0):
                if n > 0:
                    time_interval_end = self._get_closing_time(adjusted_timestamp)
                    time_remaining = time_interval_end - adjusted_timestamp
                else:
                    time_interval_start = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_timestamp, sign=-1)
                    time_remaining = adjusted_timestamp - time_interval_start

                if time_remaining >= remaining_timedelta:
                    adjusted_timestamp += remaining_timedelta
                    remaining_timedelta = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    remaining_timedelta -= time_remaining
                    if n > 0:
                        adjusted_timestamp = self._next_opening_time(time_interval_end)
                    else:
                        adjusted_timestamp = self._get_closing_time(time_interval_start - timedelta(seconds=1))
                
            business_days, _ = divmod(abs(n) * 60, business_hours_per_day)
            if n < 0:
                business_days = -business_days

        if business_days != 0:
            adjusted_timestamp += np.busdayoffset(business_days, holidays=holidays)

        return adjusted_timestamp

    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By updating the `apply` function as shown above, it should now handle the adjustments correctly with respect to holidays and business days to provide the expected behavior for the given test cases and resolve the issue mentioned on GitHub.
