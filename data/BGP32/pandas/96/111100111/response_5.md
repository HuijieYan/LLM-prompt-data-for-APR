### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class of the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is causing the failing test due to incorrect adjustments made on the `other` datetime object.
2. The `apply` function is supposed to adjust the given datetime object based on business hours, but it is not handling holidays correctly leading to unexpected results as observed in the failing test.
3. The issue is related to how holidays are handled in adjusting the datetime object. The current code doesn't consider holidays properly and leads to incorrect offsets.
4. To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `apply` function to consider holidays while adjusting the datetime object.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic in the `apply` function to account for holidays when adjusting the datetime object.
2. Update the logic to skip holidays when calculating business day offsets to avoid unwanted deviations.
3. Ensure that the adjusted datetime object aligns with the expected business hours considering the holidays.
4. Make sure the function can handle different scenarios based on positive and negative business hour adjustments.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            is_holiday = other in self.holidays

            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if not is_holiday:
                other = datetime(
                    other.year,
                    other.month,
                    other.day,
                    other.hour,
                    other.minute,
                    other.second,
                    other.microsecond,
                )

                # adjust other based on business hours and holidays
                if n >= 0:
                    if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    if other.time() in self.start:
                        other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                    if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                        other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # skip holidays while adjusting business day offsets
            if is_holiday:
                bd = 0

            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = other + skip_bd

            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                curr_hour = other.hour

                if n >= 0:
                    # forward adjustment
                    next_open = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    bhour = next_open - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = next_open
                else:
                    # backward adjustment
                    closing_time = self._get_closing_time(other)
                    bhour = other - closing_time
                    if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                        other -= bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                        other = prev_open

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying the corrections mentioned above, the `apply` function should now correctly adjust the datetime object based on business hours while considering holidays as well, thereby resolving the issue and passing the failing test.
