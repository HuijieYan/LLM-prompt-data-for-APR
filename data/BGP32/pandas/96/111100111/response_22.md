### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas.tseries.offsets` file.
2. The issue is related to creating a `DatetimeIndex` using `pd.date_range` with a custom business hour frequency and holidays, where the number of periods is not correctly accounted for when holidays are included.
3. The bug causes the generated `DatetimeIndex` to have more periods than expected when holidays are provided, leading to incorrect output. The bug likely resides in the logic of adjusting the datetime based on business hours while considering holidays.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustment of the datetime and calculation of periods correctly handle the presence of holidays in the business hour frequency.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Bug Fix:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n
        
        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        remaining_periods = abs(n)
        hours_in_business_day = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        
        if n < 0:
            remaining_periods = hours_in_business_day - remaining_periods % (hours_in_business_day // 60)

        while remaining_periods > 0:
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
            else:
                bhour = other - self._get_closing_time(other - timedelta(seconds=1))

            adjustment = min(remaining_periods * 60, bhour.total_seconds() / 60)
            other += timedelta(minutes=adjustment)

            remaining_periods -= adjustment / 60
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

After applying this corrected version, the function should handle holidays correctly and provide the expected number of periods while generating the `DatetimeIndex`. The test function provided should pass with the corrected version.
