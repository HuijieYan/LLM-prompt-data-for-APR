### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is a member of the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which inherits from `BusinessMixin` and contains several helper functions like `next_bday`, `_next_opening_time`, `_prev_opening_time`, etc.
2. The bug seems related to the adjustment of the input date based on business hours and handling holidays.
3. The failing test case involves a custom business hour with a holiday on November 26, starting on November 25 at 15:00. The expected output includes timestamps on November 25, November 27, and subsequent days in increments of 1 hour.
4. The buggy function adjusts the input date based on business hours and handles holidays incorrectly, leading to unexpected behavior with the presence of holidays.
5. To fix the issue, proper handling of holidays is required in adjusting the input date based on business hours.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic in the `apply` function to correctly adjust the input date taking into account the business hours and holidays.
2. Ensure that the adjustments consider the holiday schedule to avoid unexpected increments in dates.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            while not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                if other in self.holidays:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version has a modified logic to properly adjust the input date based on business hours while considering holidays to avoid unexpected date increments. It should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
