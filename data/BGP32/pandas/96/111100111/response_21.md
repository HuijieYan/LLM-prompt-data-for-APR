### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is designed to adjust the time based on business hours, but it fails in certain scenarios, leading to incorrect results.
2. The primary issues in the function lie in the logic for adjusting the input time based on business hours and handling edge cases related to holidays and weekends.
3. The failing test case highlights the incorrect behavior of the function when dealing with custom business hours and holidays, resulting in unexpected outputs.
4. The function should be updated to properly adjust the input time and handle holidays to align with the expected behavior described in the failing test case.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `apply` function to correctly adjust the input time based on business hours, taking into account weekends and holidays.
2. Ensure that the function handles edge cases such as moving the time to the next opening time, considering the direction of adjustment and business days.
3. Implement logic to check if the adjusted time falls on a holiday and make necessary adjustments to maintain consistency.

### Bug Fix - Corrected Version:
```python
# Bug-fixed version of the apply function
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Normalize the input datetime
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, nanosecond=0)
        
        n = self.n
        bd = abs(n) // len(self.start)  # Calculate number of business days
        
        if n < 0:
            other -= timedelta(days=1)  # Adjust for moving to previous business day
        
        while bd != 0:
            # Move to the next business day
            if n >= 0:
                other = self.next_bday.rollback(other)
            else:
                other = self.next_bday.rollforward(other)
            bd -= 1
        
        # Adjust the time based on business hours
        if n >= 0:
            for _ in range(abs(n)):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            for _ in range(abs(n)):
                other = self.next_bday.rollforward(self._prev_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By updating the `apply` function as shown above, the correction addresses the issues identified with the original implementation and aims to resolve the problem described in the failing test case.
