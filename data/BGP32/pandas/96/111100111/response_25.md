### Analysis
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class from the provided file seems to be related to working with business hours and adjusting timestamps based on specific business hour intervals. The failure is seen in a test related to custom business hours and holidays, with the `date_range_with_custom_holidays` test failing due to unexpected output.

The identified potential error locations within the `apply` function are:
1. Incorrect adjustment of timestamps based on business hours.
2. Inconsistent handling of holidays and business days.

The cause of the bug lies in the incorrect adjustment of timestamps when encountering edge cases related to holidays and the calculation of business hours. This leads to unexpected dates being generated, as seen in the failing test due to improper handling of holidays within business hour calculations.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `apply` function, we need to ensure the correct adjustment of timestamps considering holidays and business hours. This can be achieved by refining the logic around holiday handling, business hour calculations, and adjusting the timestamps accordingly.

### Corrected Function
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

        # Adjust timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # Check if other falls on a business hour or offset
        is_on_offset = self.is_on_offset(other)

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not is_on_offset:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not is_on_offset:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Calculate total business hours in one business day
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first with consideration of holidays
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd, holidays=self.holidays)
            other = skip_bd.rollforward(other, roll_to_next=False)

        # Remaining business hours adjustment
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        
        # Mark if moving forward or backward in time
        sign = 1 if n >= 0 else -1

        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
            if sign == 1:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(self._get_closing_time(other))
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By updating the logic of adjusting timestamps, handling holidays, and business days appropriately, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and provide the expected output under various scenarios.
