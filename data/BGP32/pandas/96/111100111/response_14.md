### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class within the `pandas` library is supposed to adjust business hours based on the provided input, but it contains errors that lead to unexpected behavior. The buggy function interacts with various class methods like `_next_opening_time`, `_prev_opening_time`, `_get_business_hours_by_sec`, and `_get_closing_time` to handle the adjustments required.

### Issues:
1. The adjustment logic based on the value of `self.n` appears to be causing the incorrect behavior.
2. Handling negative values of `self.n` is flawed and results in incorrect adjustments.
3. The loop logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours is creating discrepancies.

### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to originate from the flawed logic for adjusting the `other` timestamp based on the number of business hours (`self.n`) specified. This logic is used to adjust the timestamp to the next opening time, handle business day adjustments, and increment remaining hours. Mishandling negative values of `self.n` and flawed adjustment loops lead to the incorrect business hour calculation.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Verify the adjustment logic for handling positive and negative values of `self.n`.
2. Refactor the adjustment loops to ensure accurate adjustment of business hours.
3. Ensure proper handling of business day adjustments based on the specified number of business days.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
# Fix the logic for handling adjustment based on self.n value
# Refactor the adjustment loops for accurate calculation
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Retrieve nanosecond to detect edge conditions
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, nanosecond=0)  # Reset timezone and nanosecond

        n = self.n
        start_time = self.start[0]
        end_time = self.end[0]

        # Adjust other based on n value
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() > end_time or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() < start_time:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self._next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)  # Remaining business hours

        # Adjust remaining business hours
        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By applying the corrections outlined above, the function should now correctly adjust business hours based on the specified input values and pass the failing test case.
