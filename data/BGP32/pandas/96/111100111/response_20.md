### Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class and is designed to adjust a given datetime to the nearest business hour based on the parameters of the class. The function utilizes various helper functions within the same class to perform the adjustments.

However, the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is related to `pd.date_range` not working as expected when using periods and adding holidays. This issue indicates that the behavior of the date_range function is affected by the adjustment made by the buggy function, causing more periods to be generated than expected.

### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `apply` is responsible for incorrectly adjusting the datetime based on the business hours and days configured with the `CustomBusinessHour` class. The bug occurs due to incorrect calculations and conditions within the adjustment process. This leads to the produced periods being different from the expected ones, as seen in the failing test.

The adjustments to the input datetime in the function are incorrect and lead to unexpected results when handling the given business hours and days.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `apply` function, the adjustment calculations need to be revised to accurately handle the cases of positive and negative business hours. The logic for adjusting the datetime to the nearest business hour should be corrected to align with the expected behavior specified in the failing test.

### Bug-fixed Version
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# assume necessary imports are present here

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # BusinessHourMixin class definitions go here

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Drive the logic for the business hour adjustment here
            dt = other
            if self.n >= 0:
                dt = self._next_opening_time(dt)
                while not self._is_on_offset(dt):
                    dt = self._next_opening_time(dt)
            else:
                dt -= timedelta(minutes=1)
                while self._is_on_offset(dt) or dt.time() in self.start:
                    dt = self._prev_opening_time(dt)
            return dt
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By updating the adjustment logic within the `apply` function, the corrected version should now accurately adjust the datetime according to the business hours configured with the `CustomBusinessHour` class, ensuring that the periods generated by `pd.date_range` align with the expected output in the failing test.
