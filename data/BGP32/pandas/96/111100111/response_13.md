### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class and has a dependency on several other functions within the same class.
2. The function is designed to adjust the input `other` datetime object based on the business hours specified by the object's properties.
3. The bug seems to affect the adjustment logic when dealing with holidays and the number of business hours to be adjusted.
4. The failing test case involves creating a date range with a custom business hour frequency including holidays, where the expected result is incorrect due to the bug in the `apply` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `apply` function is causing incorrect behavior when adjusting business hours with holidays. It fails to accurately handle the number of periods to be added based on the business hours and holidays provided.

The incorrect adjustment logic is leading to the unexpected output where the number of periods exceeds the expected count due to mishandling of holiday occurrences.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the adjustment logic to correctly handle holidays and adjust the number of business hours based on the specified frequency.
2. Ensure that the business hours calculation and adjustment are accurate to meet the expected behavior.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            
            adjusted_datetime = other
            
            while n != 0:
                # Move to the next or previous opening time based on n
                if n > 0:
                    adjusted_datetime = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_datetime)
                    n -= 1
                else:
                    # Check if the adjusted_datetime falls on a holiday
                    while adjusted_datetime in self.holidays or not self._is_on_offset(adjusted_datetime):
                        adjusted_datetime = self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_datetime)
                        if adjusted_datetime.time() in self.start:
                            adjusted_datetime -= timedelta(days=1)
                    
                    n += 1
            
            return adjusted_datetime
            
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version addresses the adjustment logic to accurately handle holidays and adjust the number of business hours based on the specified frequency. It should pass all the provided test cases and fix the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
