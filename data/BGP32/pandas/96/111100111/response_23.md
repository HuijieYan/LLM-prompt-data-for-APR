### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `offsets.py` file of the pandas library.
2. The test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` from `test_date_range.py` fails due to unexpected behavior when using custom business hours with holidays.
3. The buggy function takes input `other` as a datetime object and performs adjustments based on business hours, holidays, and other factors to calculate the next valid datetime based on the custom business hours.
4. The bug likely lies in the calculation and adjustment logic within the function, leading to unexpected results when handling business hours with holidays.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug appears to stem from how the function handles adjustments for business days and business hours while considering holidays. The issue seems to arise when adjusting the datetime according to business hours, resulting in incorrect offsets when holidays are involved, leading to discrepancies in the calculated datetime.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the adjustment logic in the function needs to be reviewed and modified to correctly handle the scenario of calculating the next valid datetime based on business hours, holidays, and other parameters.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Check for holidays
        if other in self.holidays:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        n = self.n

        # Calculate the adjusted datetime based on business hours
        if n >= 0:
            current_time = other.time()
            if current_time in self.end:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            elif not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By incorporating the suggested changes in the adjustment logic based on business hours and holidays, the corrected function should now produce the expected results and pass the failing test cases provided.
