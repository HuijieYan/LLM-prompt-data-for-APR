### Analysis:
1. The function `apply` is a part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class and is used to adjust a given datetime based on custom business hours.
2. The function uses several helper functions within the same class to handle different parts of the adjustment process.
3. The bug seems to be causing issues with the adjustment logic, leading to incorrect output when holidays are involved in the calculation.
4. Based on the failing test case provided, the function is not correctly adjusting the datetime based on the custom business hours and holidays, leading to unexpected periods in the output.

### Bug Cause:
1. The issue arises due to incorrect adjustment of the input datetime in relation to the custom business hours and holiday.
2. The logic inside the `apply` function seems to be mishandling the adjustment based on the negative value of `self.n` and the presence of holidays.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Analyze the adjustment logic carefully to ensure that holidays are properly considered in the business hour calculations.
2. Check the conditionals related to negative `self.n` values to correctly adjust the datetime in the presence of holidays.

### Correction:
```python
import numpy as np
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BaseOffset, apply_wraps

class BusinessHourMixin:
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            other = other.replace(second=0, microsecond=0)
            
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                    
            while n != 0:
                holiday_adjust = self._next_opening_time(other)
                while holiday_adjust in np.asarray(self.holidays):
                    holiday_adjust = self._next_opening_time(holiday_adjust)
                other = holiday_adjust
                n -= 1
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected version of the `apply` function considers holidays properly during adjustments, ensuring that the output datetime is adjusted correctly based on the custom business hours and holidays.
