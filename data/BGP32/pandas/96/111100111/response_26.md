### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which extends the `BusinessMixin` class. This function is responsible for applying business hour offsets to datetime objects.
2. The function performs various calculations and adjustments to the input datetime based on the business hours specified by the user.
3. The error situation arises when the function processes `other` which is a `datetime` object. The function should adjust the input datetime based on specific business hours but due to incorrect logic, the adjustments are leading to unexpected results.
4. The `apply` function, when applied with the test case provided, results in datetime values that do not match the expected output. This causes the related test case to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Understand the logic of the `apply` function, especially the adjustments made to the input datetime based on business hours.
2. Identify the incorrect logic or calculations that are causing the function to produce unexpected results.
3. Modify the logic to correctly adjust the input datetime based on business hours and ensure that the function returns the expected output for the given test cases.
4. Run the corrected function against the failing test case to verify that the issue is resolved.

### Bug Fix:
```python
# Fixed version of the apply function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # adjust the input datetime object correctly based on business hours
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            0,  # reset seconds and microseconds to 0
            0,
        )
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying the fixed version of the `apply` function, ensure to run the failing test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` to verify that the function now produces the expected outputs and resolves the GitHub issue mentioned.
