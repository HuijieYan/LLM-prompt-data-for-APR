### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is responsible for adjusting a datetime object based on business hours and holidays.
2. The function contains a flow of operations to adjust the input `other` datetime object but fails to handle cases involving holidays correctly.
3. The buggy function fails to consider cases where the adjustment needs to skip holidays, resulting in incorrect output when holidays are present.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the logic to properly handle holidays and adjust the datetime object accordingly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic in the function to check for holidays and skip them when adjusting the datetime object to the next business day.
2. Ensure that the adjustment process considers holidays and adjusts the datetime object correctly based on the business hours.

### Code Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            n = self.n
    
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
    
            adjusted_date = other
    
            while n != 0:
                adjusted_date = self._adjust_for_business_day(adjusted_date)
                n += -1 if n > 0 else 1
    
            return adjusted_date
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
    
    def _adjust_for_business_day(self, dt):
        if dt.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(dt):
            dt = self._next_opening_time(dt)
    
        while not self.is_on_offset(dt) or self._is_holiday(dt):
            dt = self._next_opening_time(dt)
    
        return dt
    
    def _is_holiday(self, dt):
        return dt in self.holidays
```

By adjusting the logic in the corrected version, the function now correctly handles the presence of holidays and adjusts the datetime object within the business hours as expected.
