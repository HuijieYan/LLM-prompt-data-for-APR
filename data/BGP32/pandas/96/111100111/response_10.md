### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is intended to apply a business hour offset to a given datetime object. 
2. The function performs various calculations to adjust the input datetime based on the business hour constraints.
3. The issue seems to stem from the calculation logic within the function, which might not be handling certain scenarios correctly, leading to unexpected results.
4. The failing test case demonstrates the issue when using custom holidays with `CustomBusinessHour`.

### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function is not correctly handling the adjustments for custom holidays, which is causing the unexpected behavior in the test case. The issue might lie in how the function deals with holidays while calculating the adjusted datetime based on the business hours.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Review the logic related to handling holidays and adjust the calculations accordingly to ensure that the holiday dates are considered while calculating the next business hours.
2. Update the function to appropriately adjust the datetime when a holiday falls within the offset calculation period.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # reset timezone and nanosecond

                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):

                # adjust for holidays within the offset period
                while not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = other + skip_bd
    
            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                    # business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = (
                        self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    )
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        # finish adjusting if possible
                        other += bhour_remain
                        break
                    else:
                        # go to next business time interval
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other) + timedelta(seconds=1)
            else:
                while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:

                    else:

                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By updating the logic to handle holidays within the offset calculations correctly, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test case and address the issue reported on GitHub.
