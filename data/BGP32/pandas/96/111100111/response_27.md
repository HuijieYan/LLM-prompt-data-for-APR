### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is a method in the class `BusinessHourMixin` which is associated with business hour calculations. It seems to be responsible for adjusting the input datetime based on business hour offsets and constraints.
2. The function performs various calculations to adjust the input datetime according to the business hour settings provided. It handles cases where the business hour starts or ends aligned with the input datetime and adjusts the datetime accordingly.
3. The bug likely resides in the logic for adjusting the input datetime when the business hour is negative. It might not correctly handle moving to the previous working day and adjusting the time accordingly, leading to incorrect results as reported in the failing test case.
4. To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting the input datetime when `n` (business hour offset) is negative needs to be reviewed and corrected to ensure the adjustments are done correctly.
5. Based on the analysis and identified issue location, I will provide a corrected version of the `apply` function.

### Correction:
```python
# Import custom exceptions for improved error handling
from pandas.errors import ApplyTypeError

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Preserve nanosecond for edge condition detection
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        
        # Reset the timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # Adjust the business hour based on the offset
        if n >= 0:
            # Adjust if the current time is not within business hours or not on offset
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # Move to the previous business day
                other -= timedelta(days=1)
            # Adjust to the next opening time and closing time
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Calculate the total business hours in a day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        # Calculate business days and remaining minutes
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        # Adjust business hours based on business hour values
        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version takes into account the proper adjustment when the business hours offset is negative and correctly handles moving to the previous business day. It ensures that the datetime adjustments align with the defined business hour constraints.
