### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is supposed to adjust the input datetime based on business hours defined in the class. 
2. The buggy function utilizes various helper functions and instance variables from the same class and related functions within the same file.
3. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is related to custom business hours including holidays, and it fails due to incorrect adjustment of dates.
4. The bug causes the function to miscalculate the number of business days and remaining business hours, leading to incorrect adjustments in the final output.
5. The cause of the bug seems to be related to the handling of skipped business days and the calculation of remaining hours in the adjustment process.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure proper adjustment of business days and remaining hours in both positive and negative adjustment cases.
2. Validate the logic for skipping business days and adjusting remaining business hours within the defined business hours.
3. Double-check the calculations for business day adjustment and hour adjustment to ensure correct behavior.
4. Fix the adjustments for cases when moving across business days and within the same day to accurately determine the adjusted datetime.

### Bug-Fixed Version:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() not in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other -= timedelta(days=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n) * 60, businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd, weekmask=self.weekmask, holidays=self.holidays)
                if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = skip_bd.rollforward(other)
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the adjustment calculations and conditions within the function, the issues causing the incorrect adjustment of dates based on business hours have been addressed. The bug-fixed version is expected to pass the failing test and provide the correct datetime adjustments in accordance with the custom business hours defined in the class.
