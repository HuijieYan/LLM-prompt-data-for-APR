### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is intended to adjust the given datetime based on business hours specified in the class instance. It is expected to handle different cases and adjust the datetime according to business hours and days.
2. The main issue causing the bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of the negative duration of business hours.
3. The bug leads to incorrect adjustment when dealing with negative `n` values (indicating going back in time). This incorrect adjustment results in skipping certain intervals and not aligning correctly with the specified business hours.
4. To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for adjusting the datetime in cases where `n` is negative to accurately navigate back in time respecting the defined business hours.
5. The corrected version of the function will address the issue by ensuring proper adjustment based on business hours and days.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Correct the adjustment logic for negative `n` values to go back in time accurately within the specified business hours.
2. Update the code to handle the case where the datetime adjustment requires moving to the previous business day correctly.
3. Ensure that the adjustment considers the given business hours and aligns the datetime accordingly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):                
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            business_day_offset = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not business_day_offset.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open - business_day_offset + remain
            else:
                other = other - business_day_offset

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
            
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                other += bhour
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + timedelta(seconds=1))
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Summary:
The corrected function provides accurate adjustments for business hours, specifically ensuring correct navigation in time, especially when dealing with negative duration values. This fix addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue by aligning the datetime adjustments with the specified business hours and days.
