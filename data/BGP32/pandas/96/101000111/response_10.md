### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class and receives `self` and `other` as parameters.
2. The function manipulates the `other` parameter, resets its timezone and nanosecond components, adjusts based on business hours, and finally returns the updated `other`.
3. The bug might be related to how adjustments are made to the `other` parameter, potentially causing unexpected changes in the datetime value.
4. The GitHub issue indicates a similar problem where adding holidays to the frequency configuration results in unexpected behavior in generating date ranges.
5. The expected values and types of variables in different test cases provide insights into the correct behavior needed for the function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from how adjustments to the `other` parameter are handled based on the business hours and holidays. This leads to incorrect datetime calculations, as seen in the GitHub issue.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that adjustments to the `other` parameter are made correctly by considering the business hours and holidays.
2. Take into account the edge cases where adjustments need to skip specific time intervals due to holidays or business hours.

### Corrected Function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            adjusted_time = other
            while n != 0:
                if n > 0:
                    adjusted_time = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_time)
                    if adjusted_time.time() in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(adjusted_time):
                        n -= 1
                else:
                    adjusted_time = adjusted_time - timedelta(seconds=1)
                    if adjusted_time.time() in self.start:
                        n += 1
                    adjusted_time = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_time)
                    adjusted_time = self._get_closing_time(adjusted_time)

            return adjusted_time
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected function should handle adjustments to the `other` datetime parameter accurately based on the business hours and holidays, resolving the unexpected behavior reported in the GitHub issue.
