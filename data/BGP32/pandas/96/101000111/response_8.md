## Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is designed to adjust a datetime value based on a custom business hour offset. The bug seems to be causing unexpected results in the adjustment, leading to incorrect datetime values being returned. The function takes into account various conditions like the direction of adjustment (`n`), holidays, and business hours.

The bug may be related to how the function calculates the adjustment for positive and negative `n` values and how it handles business days and remaining business hours.

## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `apply` function is likely related to the adjustment logic when `n` is negative. This bug could potentially affect the correct determination of the adjusted datetime value when `n` is less than zero and certain conditions are met, leading to incorrect results.

The incorrect calculation of the adjustment for negative `n` values and the handling of business days during the adjustment process may result in shifting the datetime value to an unexpected date or time.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `apply` function, the adjustment logic for negative `n` values needs to be carefully reviewed and adjusted to correctly handle the case where `n` is less than zero. Specifically, the calculation of `bd` and `r` after the adjustment should be reviewed to ensure that the correct adjustments are made.

Additionally, the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours should be reviewed and potentially modified to ensure consistency and correctness in the adjustment process.

```python
def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    other = other - skip_bd
                else:
                    other = other - skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = (
                        self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other)) - other
                    )
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    if (
                        bhour_remain > bhour
                    ):
                        other -= bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._prev_opening_time(
                                other - bhour
                            )
                        )
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

Now, the function should correctly adjust the datetime value based on the custom business hour offset for both positive and negative `n` values, ensuring that the expected behavior is maintained for all cases mentioned in the test scenario.
