### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is designed to adjust a timestamp according to business hours defined by the `CustomBusinessHour` class. The function seems to have an issue where under certain conditions, it produces unexpected results in terms of the output timestamp. This issue is related to the lining up of proper business hours while considering holidays and business days.

### Reason for the bug:
The bug appears to stem from an incorrect adjustment of the timestamp `other` within the `apply` function. The handling of business days, weekends, and holidays is not properly coordinated, leading to discrepancies in the final timestamp calculation.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure proper handling of the given timestamp, considering working hours, holidays, and weekends.
2. Correct adjustments for moving between dates, accounting for business days and hours.
3. Validate the behavior of the function with different inputs to confirm consistent results.

### Corrected Function:
Here, the buggy function has been fixed to align the timestamp adjustments correctly according to the provided business hours and holidays.

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        
        if n >= 0:
            other_time = other.time()
            
            if other_time in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        diff_minutes = abs(n * 60)
        bd, r = divmod(diff_minutes, business_hours // 60)
        
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = self.next_bday(n=bd)
            
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd
        
        if r != 0:
            bhour_remain = Timedelta(minutes=r)
        
            while bhour_remain != Timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = Timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    if n >= 0:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                    else:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected function aims to address the issues identified with the original `apply` function. It ensures proper handling of business hours, holidays, and adjustments between timestamps based on the specified business day rules.
