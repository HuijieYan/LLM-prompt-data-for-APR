### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is designed to adjust a given `datetime` object by a specified number of business hours. It handles adjusting to the next business day, calculating business hours, adjusting by remaining hours within a business day, and handling edge cases.
2. The bug in the `apply` function may be causing unexpected adjustments in the output, leading to incorrect business hour calculations.
3. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that adding holidays results in more periods than expected when using `date_range` with the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency.
4. To fix the bug, the `apply` function needs to accurately calculate the adjustment of the input `datetime` object by the specified number of business hours without introducing unexpected behaviors.
   
### Bug Cause:
The buggy function `apply` may have a bug in the adjustment logic for handling cases where the specified number of business hours exceeds a single business day. It may not handle cases correctly where there are holidays involved, leading to incorrect adjustments and outputs.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the adjustment logic in the `apply` function should be carefully reviewed and corrected to ensure that it accurately adjusts the input `datetime` object by the specified number of business hours, accounting for holidays and edge cases.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import apply_wraps

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = self._next_basis(other)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By reviewing and updating the adjustment logic in the `apply` function, the corrected version should now handle the specified number of business hours accurately, considering holidays and edge cases as required.
