#### Analyzing the Buggy Function
The buggy function `apply` within the class `BusinessHourMixin` is designed to adjust the time based on business hours. It takes a datetime value and performs calculations to move it forward or backward based on the defined business hours and rules. The function handles cases where the input time falls outside business hours or on holidays.

#### Potential Error Locations
1. The adjustment of the input datetime `other` to remove timezone and nanosecond may lead to issues.
2. The condition checks and adjustments based on the sign of `n`.
3. Handling the calculation of business hours and adjustment of time intervals.

#### Cause of the Bug
The bug may be due to discrepancies in the adjustment of input datetime `other` and the handling of business hours calculation. Inconsistent handling of holiday times and adjustments may lead to unexpected results as observed in the GitHub issue.

#### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Ensure that the adjustments and comparisons are accurate by carefully evaluating the conditions and calculation steps.
2. Verify the calculations related to business hours and adjustments against the expected results.
3. Address the issue related to holidays to ensure that they are properly considered in the time adjustments.

#### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, date):
            n = self.n

            # adjust other to remove timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )

            # adjust other based on n value and business hours
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # calculate business hours in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            # adjust the time based on business hours
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # handle adjustments by business days
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd

            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

                if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    if n >= 0:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                    else:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with date")
```

This corrected version addresses the issues related to timezone, nanosecond, holiday consideration, and time adjustments based on business hours. It handles the conditions and calculations according to the expected behavior outlined in the GitHub issue.
