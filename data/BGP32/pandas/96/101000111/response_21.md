### Analyzing the Buggy Function
The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class and is a method that adjusts a given datetime based on business hours information. It operates on a datetime input and calculates the updated datetime by considering business hours, holidays, and other conditions.

### Potential Error Locations
1. Conversion of input to a datetime object with timezone and nanosecond attributes.
2. Check and adjustment of the input datetime.
3. Calculation of business hours and adjustments based on them.
4. Loop conditions considering the remaining business hours.
5. Handling of positive and negative cases for adjusting the datetime.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug arises due to incorrect adjustment of the input datetime and miscalculation of business hours. The function does not handle some cases properly, leading to unexpected behavior and incorrect results.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Ensure that the input datetime is correctly adjusted without losing any information.
2. Review the calculations related to business hours and adjustments to account for edge cases properly.
3. Carefully analyze the loops that adjust the remaining business hours to ensure correct behavior in both positive and negative cases.
4. To improve readability and maintainability, consider breaking down complex calculations into smaller, more manageable parts.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
# Fix the buggy function 'apply' in the 'BusinessHourMixin' class
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # Reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, nanosecond=0)

        # Adjust the input datetime based on business hours
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Calculate total business hours in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        # Calculate business days and remaining business hours
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        # Adjust remaining business hours
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
            if bhour_remain < bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and other.nanosecond != 0):
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Expected Correct Behavior
The corrected function `apply` should now properly adjust the input datetime based on the defined business hours, handle both positive and negative adjustments correctly, and return the updated datetime without any unexpected behavior.

By addressing the identified issues and adjusting the logic in the function, all the expected test cases should now pass, resolving the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
