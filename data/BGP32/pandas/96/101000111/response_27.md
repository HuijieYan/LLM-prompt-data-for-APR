### Analysis:
The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The function is supposed to apply a custom business hour offset to a given datetime. However, the function is not handling the adjustment of business days and business hours correctly, leading to incorrect results and unexpected behavior.

### Issues:
1. Incorrect adjustment of business days and business hours based on the given offset.
2. Inadequate handling of edge cases related to business hour intervals and business day adjustments.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is causing incorrect date adjustments when applying the custom business hour offset. The faulty logic fails to appropriately adjust business days and business hours, leading to unexpected results like the one described in the GitHub issue.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Properly adjust business days based on the offset.
2. Correctly adjust business hours within the business day intervals.
3. Ensure edge cases related to start, end times and holidays are handled correctly.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # Other existing functions unchanged

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            if n > 0:
                other = max(other, self._next_opening_time(other))
            else:
                other = min(other, self._prev_opening_time(other - timedelta(seconds=1)))
                other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) // 60
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
                if n > 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                else:
                    bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
        
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other += bhour
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By applying the corrected adjustments to business days and business hours based on the provided offset, the function should now return the expected results for the given test cases and resolve the issue described on GitHub.
