### Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function `apply` is defined within the `BusinessHourMixin` class. It is supposed to adjust a given datetime to the next custom business hour as per the specified business hours, start time, and end time. The function `apply` handles cases where the input `other` is a datetime object. It involves adjusting the input datetime based on the custom business hours and holidays provided.

### Potential error locations

1. Adjustment of the input datetime `other` to reset the timezone and nanosecond.
2. Calculating the business hours within a day and using it for further calculations.
3. Handling the cases where the adjustment requires moving to previous or next business days.
4. Adjusting the remaining business hours within the same business day.

### Bug explanation

The bug may arise due to incorrect handling of adjusting the input datetime `other` based on the custom business hours and holidays. Specifically, the bug seems to occur when determining if the adjusted datetime should move to the next business day or stay within the same business day, leading to unexpected results.

### Bug fix strategy

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustment of the input datetime is accurately performed considering the custom business hours, handling of holidays, moving to the next business day when necessary, and adjusting the remaining business hours within the same business day correctly.

### Corrected version of the `apply` function

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, nanosecond=0)
            
            opening_time = self._next_opening_time(other) if n >= 0 else self._prev_opening_time(other - timedelta(seconds=1))
            
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = opening_time
        
                if n >= 0:
                    while other.time() not in self.end:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    while other.time() not in self.start:
                        other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
        
                    closing_time = self._get_closing_time(other)
                    if not self._is_on_offset(closing_time):
                        other = closing_time
            
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = other + skip_bd if self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other) else self._prev_opening_time(other) + skip_bd + (other - self._prev_opening_time(other))
            
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other if n >= 0 else self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                
                if bhour_remain < bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and other.nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour) if n >= 0 else self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version of the `apply` function:
- Adjustment of the input datetime `other` considers both positive and negative offset values accurately.
- Handling of business hours and holidays to correctly determine the adjustment.
- The logic to move to the next business day or stay within the same day is improved.
- Correct adjustments for remaining business hours within the same business day are implemented.

This corrected version should address the buggy behavior and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the issue posted on GitHub related to date_range functionality with custom business hours and holidays.
