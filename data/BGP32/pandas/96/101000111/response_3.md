### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is part of the `pandas` library in the `tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The function is responsible for applying business hour offsets to a given datetime input.
3. The function receives a datetime input and adjusts it based on business hour rules, holidays, and other parameters.
4. The bug seems to be related to incorrect calculations when adjusting the input datetime based on holidays and business day restrictions.
5. The GitHub issue indicates the problem when using `date_range` with `CustomBusinessHour` and holidays, causing unexpected behavior in the output.

### Bug Cause:
1. The buggy function fails to correctly adjust the input datetime when holidays are involved.
2. The logic for incrementing/decrementing business days and adjusting business hours seems to be faulty.
3. This leads to the unexpected behavior described in the GitHub issue, where more periods are generated than expected due to incorrect adjustments based on holidays.

### Solution Strategy:
1. Update the logic for adjusting the input datetime to properly handle holidays and business day restrictions.
2. Ensure the correct number of periods are generated without any extraneous dates caused by incorrect adjustments.
3. Review the adjustment calculations based on positive and negative offsets to accurately adjust the input datetime.
4. Test the corrected function against the provided cases to verify that the output aligns with the expected results.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# Import relevant libraries if necessary

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # Other functions in the class

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            adjusted_dt = other.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

            # Adjust by business days first
            if n != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=n)
                adjusted_dt = self.next_bday(adjusted_dt) if n > 0 else self.prev_bday(adjusted_dt)
                while skip_bd.is_on_offset(adjusted_dt):
                    adjusted_dt = self.next_bday(adjusted_dt, roll=True) if n > 0 else self.prev_bday(adjusted_dt, roll=True)

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=self.n * 60)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_dt)) - adjusted_dt if n >= 0 else self._next_opening_time(adjusted_dt) - adjusted_dt
                if n % 24 == 0:  # Full days remaining
                    adjusted_dt = adjusted_dt.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0) + timedelta(days=1)
                    bhour_remain -= timedelta(days=1)
                elif bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    adjusted_dt = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_dt + bhour)
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                else:
                    adjusted_dt += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

            return adjusted_dt.replace(hour=other.hour, minute=other.minute, second=other.second, microsecond=other.microsecond)

        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The correction aims to properly handle adjustments based on holidays, business days, and business hours to align with the expected results and resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
