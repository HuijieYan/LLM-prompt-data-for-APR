### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class within the `pandas.tseries.offsets` module is responsible for adjusting datetime objects based on business hours. The provided expected input/output values describe the correct behavior of the function for different scenarios.

### Potential error locations:
1. Incorrect adjustment of the `other` datetime object.
2. Incorrect calculation and adjustment of business days.
3. Incorrect handling of remaining business hours.
4. Possible issues with adjusting `bhour_remain`.
5. Incorrect calculations to reach the next business time interval.

### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to be caused by incorrect adjustments related to business days and business hours within the `apply` function. The incorrect handling of weekdays, business hours, and holidays is leading to unexpected results, as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure correct adjustments of the `other` datetime object.
2. Verify proper calculation and handling of business days.
3. Correctly handle remaining business hours to adjust.
4. Adjust calculations related to business time intervals.

### Corrected Function:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            
            # Adjust the other datetime properly
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() >= self.end[0] or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() == self.start[0]:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # Calculate total business hours in one business day
            business_hours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday().is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd

            # Remaining business hours adjustment
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected adjustments within the `apply` function should now align with the expected input/output values and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
