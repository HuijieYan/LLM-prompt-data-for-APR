### Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is supposed to adjust a given datetime object based on custom business hours. The function takes a `self` object representing custom business hours, a `datetime` object `other`, and adjusts the `other` datetime object according to the business hours specified in `self`.

The bug seems to cause discrepancies in adjusting the datetime object when there are specific conditions related to the beginning and ending of business hours. This can be seen from the multiple test cases where the output datetime values are unexpected when compared to the input parameters.

The issue on GitHub suggests that using `pd.date_range` with periods and holidays in custom business hours is not producing the expected output, and it seems related to the incorrect implementation of business hour adjustments in the `apply` function.

### Error Identification
1. Adjusting the provided `other` datetime object to reset the timezone and nanosecond values may lose precision or cause unexpected behavior.
2. The condition checks and adjustments for positive and negative values of `n` are causing discrepancies when handling different edge cases.
3. The calculation and adjustment of business hours and days are not correctly handling all scenarios, leading to unexpected results in the output datetime object.
4. The adjustment of remaining business hours in each scenario seems to be prone to errors based on the conditions and calculations performed.

### Bug Cause
The buggy function `apply` contains several logic errors in handling the adjustment of custom business hours to the input datetime object. The incorrect conditions, inaccurate calculations, and improper adjustments lead to unexpected output datetime objects.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To address the bug in the `apply` function and adhere to the expected input/output values and resolve the GitHub issue, the following strategies can be employed:
1. Improve accuracy in resetting the timezone and nanosecond values of the `other` datetime object to ensure precision is maintained.
2. Refine the conditional checks and adjustments for positive and negative values of `n` to handle all edge cases correctly.
3. Enhance the calculation and adjustment of business hours and days to produce accurate adjustments based on the custom business hours defined in the `self` object.
4. Rectify the adjustment of remaining business hours to ensure proper handling of all scenarios without discrepancy.

### Corrected Function
Based on the identified bug causes and fixing strategies, below is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        n = self.n
        
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, nanosecond=0)
        
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
            
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = CustomBusinessHour(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self.next_bday.rollforward(other)
            other = other + skip_bd
        
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        
        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
            
            if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other += CustomBusinessHour(n=1)
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected function provides adjustments to the original `apply` function to ensure proper handling of custom business hours and accurate adjustment of the input datetime object based on the specified business hours.
