### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is named `apply` and is within the `BusinessHourMixin` class.
2. The function takes an argument `other`, which is expected to be a `datetime` object.
3. The function performs various calculations in order to adjust the provided `datetime` value based on business hours and days.
4. The function seems to be misbehaving, causing issues when used with dates involving holidays, as reported in the GitHub issue.
5. The critical parts of the function involve adjusting the provided timestamp based on business hours and days, which is where the bug likely originates.
6. The calculations related to adjusting by business days and remaining business hours need to be reviewed closely to identify the cause of the issue.

### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to stem from incorrect handling of holidays within the function. When a holiday is encountered within the calculation, the function does not adjust the dates correctly, resulting in unexpected behavior as observed in the failing test scenarios.

### Proposed Fix Strategy:
1. Implement a check to detect holidays and appropriately adjust the dates based on the presence of holidays during the adjustment process.
2. Ensure that the adjustment logic for business days and remaining business hours correctly considers holidays to avoid discrepancies in the output.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# Corrected apply function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                if other in self.holidays:
                    other += BusinessDay(n=1, holidays=self.holidays)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))
                while other in self.holidays:
                    other += BusinessDay(n=1, holidays=self.holidays)
            other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        # rest of the logic remains the same from original function

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By incorporating holiday checks in the adjustment process, the corrected function should behave as expected and address the issues reported in the GitHub bug.
