### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is intended to adjust a given datetime object based on custom business hours specified by the user. The existing code is causing issues where timestamps are not adjusted correctly, leading to unexpected behavior. The bug seems to stem from the logic used to adjust the business hours and handle edge cases.

### Error Locations:
1. Adjustment of `other` to remove timezone and nanosecond: This operation may affect the timestamp.
2. Handling of negative `n` values: The adjustment logic for negative values may be incorrect.
3. Business hours calculation and adjustment logic: The iteration over business hours and the process for adjusting remaining business hours may have issues.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug causes incorrect adjustments to the provided timestamp `other`, leading to unexpected results in the returned timestamp. The handling of negative values and the logic for adjusting the timestamp within business hours may not be correct, causing the issue reported in the GitHub thread.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure proper adjustment of the provided timestamp without altering critical attributes.
2. Correctly handle negative values of `n` and adjust the timestamp accordingly.
3. Validate and adjust the logic for iterating over business hours and adjusting remaining business hours.

```

This corrected version addresses the issues mentioned above and should provide the expected behavior as outlined in the test cases.
