### Analysis
The buggy function applies business hours to a datetime object, adjusting it according to the business hours specified. The issue reported on GitHub is related to unexpected behavior when adding holidays in the period calculation for custom business hours. The problem seems to be with the calculation of periods when holidays are involved. The functions involved in handling business hours, next opening time, and closing time need to be reviewed for potential bugs causing this issue.

### Error Location
The error seems to be related to the incorrect handling of holidays in the `apply` function. The mismatch in the number of periods calculated can lead to anomalous output. The adjustment logic for holidays within the function might not be functioning as expected.

### Bug Cause
The buggy function does not account for holidays when adjusting datetime objects based on business hours. This omission leads to an incorrect number of periods being calculated, causing the unexpected behavior observed in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should properly handle holidays when adjusting time based on business hours. By ensuring holidays are correctly considered in the calculation of periods, the function should provide the expected output and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.

### Corrected Function
```python
# Corrected apply function with holiday handling
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Check if other contains a nanosecond attribute
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

        # Adjust other's timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # Adjust other for business hours and holidays
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            # Handle holidays during the adjustment
            while not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            while not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected function includes adjustments to handle holidays properly within the business hour calculation logic. By updating the holiday handling logic, the function should produce the expected results outlined in the test cases and address the issue reported on GitHub.
