### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is using edge time conditions and adjusting the input timestamp (`other`) based on the business hours specified by `self`. The function is intended to calculate the next business day timestamp after applying the specified business hours offset.
2. The bug is likely in the calculation logic within the function, particularly in the adjustment of the input timestamp based on business hours and handling negative offsets.
3. The bug causes the outputs to differ from the expected values, leading to incorrect calculations.
4. To fix the bug, the logic for handling positive and negative offsets and adjusting the timestamp based on business hours needs to be reviewed and corrected.

### Bug Fix:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not using replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        if n >= 0:
            while n > 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                n -= 1
        else:
            while n < 0:
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                n += 1

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This correction simplifies the adjustment logic by iterating through the number of business hours to add or subtract (`n`) directly, ensuring that the adjustments are correctly made without overcomplicating the calculations.
