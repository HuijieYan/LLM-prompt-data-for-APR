### Analysis
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class and contains logic to adjust business hours based on the input `other` which is expected to be a `datetime`.
2. The function performs various calculations related to business hours and adjusts the input datetime accordingly.
3. The function uses several helper functions like `_next_opening_time`, `_get_closing_time`, and `_is_on_offset` to handle the business hour adjustments.
4. The bug seems to be related to the adjustment of business days and hours causing unexpected behavior during date range calculations with holidays.

### Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by incorrect calculations in the `apply` function leading to unexpected business hour adjustments when a holiday is encountered. It results in the function returning more than the specified periods in certain cases involving holidays.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the business hour adjustments are correctly handled when holidays are present. We should review the logic related to business day adjustments and ensure that it aligns with the expected behavior, especially when encountering holidays.

### Corrected Code
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            orig_other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )

            adjusted_dt = self.adjust_business_hours(orig_other, n)

            return adjusted_dt
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

    def adjust_business_hours(self, dt, n):
        if n >= 0:
            adjust_fn = self.adjust_forward
        else:
            adjust_fn = self.adjust_backward

        adjusted_dt = dt
        for _ in range(abs(n)):
            adjusted_dt = adjust_fn(adjusted_dt)

        return adjusted_dt

    def adjust_forward(self, dt):
        adjusted_dt = dt
        while True:
            if adjusted_dt.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(adjusted_dt):
                adjusted_dt = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_dt)
            else:
                break

        return adjusted_dt

    def adjust_backward(self, dt):
        adjusted_dt = dt
        while True:
            if adjusted_dt.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                adjusted_dt -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(adjusted_dt):
                adjusted_dt = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_dt)
                adjusted_dt = self._get_closing_time(adjusted_dt)
            else:
                break

        return adjusted_dt
```

This corrected code introduces separate functions for adjusting business hours and handles forward and backward adjustments based on the input parameter `n`. By breaking down the adjusting logic and ensuring correct adjustments with holidays, the bug causing unexpected behavior during date range calculations with holidays should be fixed.
