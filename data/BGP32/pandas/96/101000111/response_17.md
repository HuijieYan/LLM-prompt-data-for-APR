### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply(self, other)` is a method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class.
2. The function is intended to adjust a given timestamp based on business hours specified by the class, taking into account holidays and other relevant parameters.
3. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect calculation of business hours leading to unexpected timestamp adjustments.
4. The provided expected values for multiple test cases will guide us in fixing the bug and ensuring the function's correctness.
5. The GitHub issue indicates a similar problem related to the behavior of `pd.date_range` when using periods and adding holidays.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `apply` function arises from the incorrect calculation of the remaining business hours to adjust. This results in the timestamp being shifted more than necessary or to an incorrect value, leading to unexpected behavior as demonstrated in the GitHub issue.

### Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug and address the GitHub issue:
- Update the calculation of remaining business hours to adjust.
- Ensure that the adjustments made align correctly with the specified business hours and holidays.
- Validate the adjustments in both positive and negative adjustment cases to handle forward and backward shifts accurately.

### Bug-free corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
# Assuming necessary imports are already available

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        if self._is_on_offset(other):
            return other
        
        if n > 0:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), (businesshours//60))
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
            other += skip_bd
        
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        
        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
            else:
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
            
            if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                return other + bhour_remain
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By revising the calculation logic in the corrected version, the `apply` function should now handle adjustments of timestamps based on the specified business hours accurately, aligning with the expected test cases and resolving the issue described on GitHub.
