### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is designed to apply a business hour offset to a given datetime object. It aims to adjust the given datetime to business hours based on the specified business hour range.
2. The bug occurs in the logic of adjusting the datetime based on the business hour offset and handling cases where the input datetime falls outside the business hour range.
3. The bug causes unexpected behavior in adjusting the datetime, leading to incorrect results when calculating the adjusted time.
4. To fix the bug, we need to review the logic for adjusting the datetime within the business hour range and ensure that the adjustments are correctly applied according to the specified business offset.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic for adjusting the datetime based on the business hour offset to ensure that the adjustments are correctly applied.
2. Specifically, pay attention to cases where the input datetime falls outside the business hour range and ensure proper handling for such cases.
3. Make sure that the adjustments for business days and business hours are accurately calculated and applied to the given datetime.

### Bug-fixed Function:
```python
# Function with bug fix
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd
        
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        
        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and other.nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
    
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making the adjustments mentioned above to the buggy function, the corrected version should now provide the expected output for the given cases and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
