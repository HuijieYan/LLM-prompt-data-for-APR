### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas.tseries.offsets` module. This function is responsible for applying business hour logic to a given datetime object. The function processes the input datetime based on the specified business hours, holidays, and other parameters.

The buggy behavior reported in the GitHub issue seems to be related to incorrect adjustments based on business hours and holidays when calculating the next datetime. This results in an incorrect number of periods when using the `date_range` function with the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency and holidays.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug seems to stem from the incorrect handling of adjustments for business days and business hours within the `apply` function. The function fails to properly adjust the datetime object for each business day and remaining business hours, leading to discrepancies in the output periods.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments for business days and business hours are correctly calculated and applied to the input datetime object. By carefully adjusting the datetime object based on the business hours and holidays, we can ensure that the resulting periods match the expected behavior.

### Bug-fixed Code:
Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
# This import is necessary for the correct functioning of the apply_wraps decorator
from pandas.tseries.offsets import ApplyTypeError

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            
            n = self.n
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other.replace(second=59)  # Move back 1 second
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            total_business_hours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            business_days, remaining_hours = divmod(abs(n), total_business_hours // 60)

            if n < 0:
                business_days *= -1
                remaining_hours *= -1

            if business_days != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=business_days)

                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd

            remaining_timedelta = timedelta(minutes=remaining_hours)

            while remaining_timedelta != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    closing_time_prev = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))
                    business_hours_left = closing_time_prev - other
                else:
                    opening_time_next = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    business_hours_left = opening_time_next - other

                if remaining_timedelta < business_hours_left:
                    other += remaining_timedelta
                    remaining_timedelta = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    remaining_timedelta -= business_hours_left
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + business_hours_left)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By ensuring proper adjustments for business days, business hours, and holidays, the corrected version of the `apply` function should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and produce the expected output values for the given test cases.
