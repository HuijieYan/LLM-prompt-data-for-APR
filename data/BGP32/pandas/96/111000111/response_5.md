### Analysis:
- The buggy function `apply` is supposed to handle business hour calculations based on the input `other`, which is expected to be a `datetime` object.
- The function seems to adjust the input `other` based on business hours, holidays, and other specific conditions.
- The bug seems to be causing discrepancies in the calculations when holidays are involved, leading to unexpected results in the output.
- The issue reported on GitHub also aligns with the problem of incorrect period calculation when holidays are considered.

### Bug:
- The bug seems to stem from the calculation logic within the `apply` function related to business day adjustments when holidays are present.
- The incorrect handling of holidays might be causing the function to miscalculate the periods and result in unexpected timestamps.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
- One possible strategy to fix the bug would be to review the logic related to holiday adjustments in the function.
- Ensure that holidays are correctly considered when calculating business hours and adjusting timestamps accordingly.
- The function should accurately handle the scenario where holidays affect the business day calculations and adjust the periods accordingly.

### Corrected function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Reset timezone and nanosecond to accurately adjust the timestamp
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # Adjust the timestamp based on business hours and holidays
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Get total business hours in one day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        # Calculate adjustments by business days and business hours
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Business day adjustments
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)

            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # Remaining business hour adjustments
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        # Adjust timestamps based on business hours
        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if (
                    bhour_remain > bhour
                    or bhour_remain == bhour
                    and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0
                ):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(
                        self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))
                    )

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function addresses the bug related to holiday adjustments and should now correctly handle business hour calculations with holidays involved.
