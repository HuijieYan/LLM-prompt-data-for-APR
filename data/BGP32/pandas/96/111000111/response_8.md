### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is meant to adjust the input datetime object based on CustomBusinessHour settings like start and end times. It is used to calculate the next business hour considering different cases and applying necessary adjustments.
   
2. The potential error location in the buggy function can be identified in the calculation and adjustment section based on the business hours and the input datetime object `other`.

3. The bug causes incorrect adjustments in certain cases resulting in an incorrect output datetime value. It seems that the adjustment logic is flawed, causing the function to return unexpected dates, especially when dealing with holidays and business hour boundaries.

4. To fix the bug:
    - Verify the adjustment logic for handling business days and business hours to ensure correctness.
    - Check the calculation of business hours and adjustments based on positive and negative values of `self.n`.
    - Ensure proper handling of edge cases such as holidays and start/end times of business hours.

5. Below is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# Updated and corrected apply function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        day_increment = 1 if n >= 0 else -1

        if n >= 0:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() < self.start[0]:
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        for _ in range(abs(bd)):
            other += timedelta(days=day_increment)
            while not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
            current_business_hour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other if n >= 0 else self._next_opening_time(other) - other

            if n >= 0 and bhour_remain < current_business_hour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            elif n < 0 and (bhour_remain > current_business_hour or bhour_remain == current_business_hour and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0):
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other - timedelta(seconds=1)))

                bhour_remain -= current_business_hour

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and produce the expected output for the provided test cases.
