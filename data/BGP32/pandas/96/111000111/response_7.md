### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `offsets.py` file is designed to adjust a datetime object based on custom business hours and days. The main goal is to calculate the adjusted datetime considering business hours and days for a given offset `n`.
2. The buggy function displays unexpected behavior, causing the output to deviate from the expected results outlined in the GitHub issue. The bug seems to arise due to incorrect handling of business days and hours within the function.
3. Based on the provided test cases and GitHub issue, the function fails to adjust the datetime correctly when incorporating holidays and periods. The issue seems to stem from the calculation logic for adjusting the datetime based on business days and hours.
4. To fix the bug, the adjustment logic within the `apply` function needs to be revised to correctly handle holidays and periods while ensuring that the adjusted datetime aligns with the custom business hours and days as specified.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the adjustment of the datetime considers the custom business hours and days.
2. Correctly handle the adjustment based on periods, holidays, and business hours to align with the expected behavior.
3. Revise the logic for adjusting the datetime to respect the custom business hours and days for both positive and negative offsets.
4. Account for edge cases and handle them appropriately during the adjustment process.

### Corrected Function:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessDay, CustomBusinessHour, apply_wraps

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
            )
    
            if n >= 0:
                while n > 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    n -= 1
            else:
                while n < 0:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    n += 1
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By updating the adjustment logic as shown in the corrected function above, the `apply` function should now properly adjust the datetime object based on the custom business hours and days, considering the specified offset `n`. This correction aims to address the bug and align the function's behavior with the expected results provided in the GitHub issue.
