### Analyzing the Buggy Function

The buggy function is `apply` defined in the `BusinessHourMixin` class. It is supposed to apply custom business hours logic to a given timestamp (`other`). The function adjusts the timestamp based on business hours, holidays, and other factors.

### Identifying Potential Errors

1. The adjustment logic based on business hours and holidays may be incorrect.
2. The calculation of business hours and adjustment of the timestamp may not be accurate.
3. Handling of negative business day values (for moving back in time) may have issues.

### Explanation of the Bug

The bug seems to stem from the logic related to adjusting timestamps based on business hours and holidays. Calculations involving the adjustment of business days (`bd`), remaining business hours (`bhour_remain`), and moving the timestamp accordingly seem to be faulty.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug

1. Review the logic related to adjusting timestamps based on business hours and holidays.
2. Ensure accurate calculation of business hours and proper handling of negative business day values.
3. Check the adjustment process to move the timestamp within the business hours correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
# Corrected version of the apply function to address the bug

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = (
                        self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    )
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                        )
                    )

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should address the issues related to the adjustment of timestamps based on custom business hours and holidays, ensuring that the function behaves as expected in all specified cases.
