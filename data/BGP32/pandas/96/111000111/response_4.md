## Bug Analysis
1. The `apply` function in the `BusinessHourMixin` class within the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is designed to adjust a given datetime value based on business hours. It should handle offset adjustments and business day skips correctly.
2. The bug seems to arise from incorrect calculation of business days and remaining business hours to adjust.
3. The bug causes unexpected datetime values to be returned when trying to adjust for business days and remaining business hours.
4. To fix the bug, we need to accurately calculate business days and remaining hours to adjust the datetime value correctly.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Improve the calculation of business days and remaining hours adjustments to accurately reflect the desired behavior.
2. Ensure proper handling of edge cases and conditions to handle all scenarios correctly.

## Corrected Function

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other based on business hours
            if n >= 0:
                while n > 0:
                    while other.time() not in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    n -= 1
            else:
                while n < 0:
                    while other.time() not in self.end:
                        other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    while other.time() not in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected function has been updated to adjust the given datetime `other` accurately based on business hours. This should resolve the bug and align with the expected input/output values for the provided test cases.
