### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is designed to adjust a given datetime `other` based on custom BusinessHours specified by the `self` object. The function manipulates the datetime according to certain conditions related to the start and end times of the business hours, adjusting for business days, remaining business hours, etc.

The bug seems to be related to the misalignment of the adjusted datetime with the specified business hours when handling negative values of `self.n`. The incorrect calculation leads to unexpected datetime values.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the handling of negative values of `self.n` in the `apply` function. When `self.n` is negative, the function should adjust `other` accordingly to the previous business day, but the calculation does not correctly account for this adjustment, leading to incorrect output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the calculation of the negative case for `self.n` to correctly go to the previous business day, then proceed with the adjustment of remaining business hours as needed.
2. Ensure that the adjustment of the datetime aligns with the specified business hours for both positive and negative values of `self.n`.

### Bug-fixed Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)  # Adjust to the previous business day
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = (
                    self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                )
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if (bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0)):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

```

This bug-fixed version corrects the issue related to adjusting the datetime correctly for negative values of `self.n`, ensuring that the datetime aligns with the specified business hours as expected.
