### Analysis:
The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The function takes an argument `other`, which is expected to be a `datetime` object. The function adjusts the given `datetime` based on the defined business hours and other parameters to calculate the next business time considering business days and remaining hours.

The issue arises during this adjustment process leading to unexpected results in the calculated `datetime`.

### Identified Bug:
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of the adjustment process in the `apply` function. The discrepancy in calculations for positive and negative values of `n` seems suspicious. Additionally, the check for `if n >= 0` is not accompanied by an else block for `n < 0`, which might lead to incorrect adjustments.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the logic for handling positive and negative values of `n` correctly.
2. Ensure proper handling of the adjustment process to avoid any discrepancies.
3. Add necessary checks and adjustments based on the calculation for positive and negative `n`.

### Bug Fix:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the apply function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(

            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            closing_time = self._get_closing_time(other)
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(closing_time):

            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        business_days, remaining_minutes = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours_per_day // 60)
        if n < 0:

                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        remaining_time = timedelta(minutes=remaining_minutes)

        if n >= 0:
            while remaining_time != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if remaining_time < bhour:
                    other += remaining_time
                    remaining_time = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    remaining_time -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while remaining_time != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if remaining_time > bhour or (remaining_time == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += remaining_time
                    remaining_time = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    remaining_time -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function should address the issue and provide the expected output in all the given test cases.
