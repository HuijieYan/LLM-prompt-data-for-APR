### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is a method within the `BusinessHourMixin` class, responsible for applying business hour offsets to a datetime object.
2. The function has multiple conditional statements and calculations related to adjusting the datetime object based on business hours, holidays, and other parameters.
3. The bug causes unexpected behavior when the holiday parameter is introduced, leading to incorrect results in date calculations. This is reflected in the GitHub issue where the period calculation goes awry when holidays are considered.
4. The issue stems from improper handling of holidays within the function, leading to discrepancies in date calculations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- We need to address the handling of holidays in the `apply` function to ensure that it correctly adjusts the datetime object without causing the issue described in the GitHub report.
- Adjust the logic related to business days, holidays, and other time calculations to ensure that holiday dates are properly considered and do not disrupt the period calculations.
- Verify the conditions for adjusting the datetime object based on business days and holidays to ensure consistency and correctness in date calculations.
- Implement a more robust logic to handle holidays within the function without affecting the overall functionality.

### Bug-Fixed Function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
            
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
            
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd, holidays=self.holidays)
                other = other + skip_bd
            
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour:
                    other += bhour
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                else:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By incorporating the adjustments outlined in the bug fix strategy, the corrected function should now handle holidays properly and generate the expected results as specified in the test cases.
