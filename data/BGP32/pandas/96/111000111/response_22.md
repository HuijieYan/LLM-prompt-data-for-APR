### Analysis
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `offsets.py` file of the pandas library.
2. The function takes an input `other` which is expected to be an instance of `datetime`.
3. The function performs operations to adjust the given datetime based on business hours, business days, and holidays.
4. The observed issue is related to incorrect adjustments when holidays are included, leading to unexpected behavior as reported in the GitHub issue.
5. The function should correctly adjust the datetime based on business hours while considering holidays and business days.

### Bug Explanation
The bug arises from incorrect handling of holidays causing the function to miscalculate periods in the presence of holidays. Specifically, when adjusting the datetime based on business days, holidays are not accounted for correctly, which results in an incorrect final datetime.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, adjustments related to holidays need to be correctly implemented to ensure that the datetime is adjusted accurately while considering holidays and maintaining the correct number of periods.

### Updated Function
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                # midnight business hour may not on BusinessDay
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other - timedelta(seconds=1)):
                    other = self.next_bday.apply(other)
                other = other + skip_bd
    
            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = (
                    self.next_bday._prev_opening_time(other) - other
                )
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self.next_bday._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correctly adjusting the datetime based on business days, holidays, and business hours within the loop, the function should now accurately handle the adjustment process based on the provided cases and address the issue reported in the GitHub discussion.
