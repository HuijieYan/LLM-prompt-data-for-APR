### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `apply` within the class `BusinessHourMixin` is intended to adjust the time based on custom business hours. The bug seems to stem from incorrect calculations and adjustments made within the function, leading to unexpected outputs.

#### Error Locations
1. Adjusting the `other` datetime object by removing its timezone and nanosecond information.
2. The adjustment logic when `n` is less than 0.
3. Calculation of `bd` (business days) and `r` (remaining minutes) based on the input `n`.
4. Incorrect application of business days adjustment.

#### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by improper handling of adjustments and calculations within the `apply` function. The adjustment of the input datetime `other` and the subsequent calculations of business days and remaining minutes are not accurately performed, leading to errors in the final output.

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Properly adjust the datetime object `other` without removing timezone and nanosecond information.
2. Correct the logic for when `n` is less than 0 to ensure correct adjustments.
3. Ensure accurate calculation of `bd` and `r` based on the value of `n`.
4. Implement the logic for adjusting business days accurately.

### Corrected Version
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            # adjust other without removing timezone and nanosecond
            other = other.replace(second=0, microsecond=0)

            if n >= 0:
                if other.strftime('%H:%M:%S') not in [st.strftime('%H:%M:%S') for st in self.end] \
                        or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.strftime('%H:%M:%S') in [st.strftime('%H:%M:%S') for st in self.start]:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and other.nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected version of the `apply` function should now accurately adjust the provided datetime based on the custom business hours specified. This correction should resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
