## Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The function takes a `datetime` object as an input and performs various adjustments based on the defined business hours and offsets. The function aims to calculate the next business time based on the input datetime and the specified parameters.

The potential error locations within the buggy function include the conditional branches that handle the adjustment of the input datetime `other` based on the business hours and offsets. Additionally, the calculation of business hours and adjustments by business days might contain issues.

The bug seems to stem from the incorrect handling of the adjustment logic when dealing with negative values of `n` (offsets) and determining the next business time based on the current time within the business hours. This bug results in incorrect calculations and leads to unexpected output.

### Cause of the bug
1. The conditional logic inside the `apply` function that handles negative offsets is incorrect. The adjustment for negative offsets is not properly calculating the next business time and closing time.
2. The calculations related to adjusting the input datetime by business hours and days might not be accurate, leading to discrepancies in the final result.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Review and correct the conditional branches that handle positive and negative offsets to ensure correct adjustment of the input datetime.
2. Verify the calculations related to business hours and adjustment by business days to guarantee the correct computation of the next business time.
3. Ensure that the adjustments made are based on the defined business hours and offsets properly to align with the expected behavior of the function.

### Corrected Version
Here is a corrected version of the `apply` function based on the identified issues:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n
        
        # Adjust the input datetime based on the offset sign
        if n >= 0:
            if not self._is_on_offset(other) or other.time() in self.end:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            else:
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        # Calculate business hours in a day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        
        # Compute the adjustment for business days
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd
        
        # Calculate remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        
        # Loop to adjust based on remaining business hours
        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                
            if bhour_remain < bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version aims to properly handle the adjustment for positive and negative offsets and ensure the correct calculation of the next business time based on the specified business hours and offsets. The adjustments by business days and remaining business hours have also been reviewed and improved.
