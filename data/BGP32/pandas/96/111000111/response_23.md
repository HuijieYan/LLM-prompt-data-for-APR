### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is designed to adjust a given timestamp based on business hours, considering opening and closing times and handling edge cases like holidays. 
2. The bug seems to occur when adjusting to the next opening time after a holiday. This leads to an incorrect number of periods being generated, as reported in the GitHub issue.
3. The incorrect behavior is likely due to the logic in handling adjustments after holidays and opening times, which does not correctly account for the holiday existence. This results in the generation of extra periods in the output.
4. To fix the bug, the adjustment logic after a holiday needs to be revised to ensure the correct computation of periods and the appropriate handling of holidays.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic related to adjustments after holidays to properly account for the holiday's impact on the business hours.
2. Ensure that the adjustment process accurately handles the next opening time after a holiday, avoiding the generation of extra periods.

### Corrected Code:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1)
                while other in self.holidays or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    if n >= 0:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                    else:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With the revised adjustment logic after holidays, the corrected function should now handle adjustments accurately and avoid generating extra periods as reported in the GitHub issue.
