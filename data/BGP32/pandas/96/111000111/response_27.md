## Analysis
The bug is caused by the incorrect adjustment of the input `other` datetime object within the `apply` function of the `CustomBusinessHour` class. The function is supposed to calculate the next business hour based on the input datetime, taking into account the start and end times of the business hour within a day, business holidays, and the number of business hours to move forward or backward.

However, there are errors in the logic related to handling negative business hours (`n`) and adjusting the datetime accordingly. These errors lead to incorrect calculations, resulting in the generation of more periods than expected.

## Bugs in the Buggy Function
1. Incorrect handling of negative business hours when adjusting the datetime.
2. Errors in calculating the next business time interval and remaining business hours to adjust.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to accurately adjust the input datetime for both positive and negative business hours. The logic for moving to the next business time interval and calculating the remaining business hours needs to be corrected to ensure the function returns the expected datetime without generating extra periods.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class CustomBusinessHour(BusinessHourMixin, CustomBusinessMixin, BaseOffset):
    
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            opening_time = min(self.start)
            closing_time = max(self.end)
    
            while n != 0:
                if n > 0:
                    if other.time() >= closing_time or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                        n -= 1
                else:
                    if other.time() < opening_time:
                        other = other.replace(hour=closing_time.hour, minute=closing_time.minute)
                    elif other.time() in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                        n += 1
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function ensures that the adjustments for positive and negative business hours are handled correctly. The function now moves the input datetime to the next appropriate business hour based on the start and end times, without generating extra periods as observed in the buggy version.
