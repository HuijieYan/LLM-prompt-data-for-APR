### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class which inherits from `BusinessMixin`.
2. The function performs business hour calculations based on the input datetime object `other` and the attributes of the `self` object.
3. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect calculation of the business hours when a holiday is involved, leading to discrepancies in the output.
4. The function needs to handle holidays correctly to ensure the desired behavior of business hour adjustments.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `apply` function arises from incorrect handling of holidays in the calculation of business hours. When a holiday is present, the function does not adjust the business days properly, leading to an incorrect number of periods in the output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling holidays and business days in the `apply` function. The adjustment will ensure that the correct number of business days are skipped when encountering a holiday.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# Corrected version of the apply function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # Handle holidays correctly for business day adjustment
            businessdays = abs(n)
            if n < 0:
                businessdays = -businessdays
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=businessdays)

            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

            while other.time() not in self.start:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the handling of holidays and business days in the corrected version of the `apply` function, the bug causing an incorrect number of periods when holidays are present should be resolved.
