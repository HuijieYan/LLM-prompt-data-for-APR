### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is intended to adjust a given datetime based on custom business hours defined by the class. It handles the adjustment by business days and remaining business hours within a single business day.
2. The bug causes the function to miscalculate the adjustments, especially when negative adjustments are required.
3. The bug leads to incorrect results, such as producing more than the expected number of periods when holidays are added in certain cases.
4. The strategy for fixing the bug involves reviewing the adjustment logic within the function and correcting the calculation for both positive and negative adjustments.

            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Explanation:
1. The adjusted logic for positive and negative adjustments within the function has been corrected to handle business days and remaining business hours separately.
2. The loop to adjust remaining business hours ensures correct adjustments are made based on positive or negative values of `n`.
3. The corrected function should now produce the expected results for all the provided test cases.
4. The bug is fixed by revising the adjustment process ensuring accurate handling of business hours and days.
