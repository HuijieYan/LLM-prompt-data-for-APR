The bug in the provided function is related to the way the `other` parameter is updated and adjusted within the function, specifically when handling the adjustments based on the business hours.

The function seems to be incorrectly adjusting the `other` parameter when `n >= 0` and `n < 0` conditions are checked. The adjustments intended to move to the next opening time or the previous business day are not correctly implemented, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, I suggest making the following changes:

1. Update the logic for adjusting `other` based on whether `n` is positive or negative.
2. Ensure that the adjustments correctly align with the business hours and days.
3. Handle the edge cases where the adjustment may require moving to the next or previous business day correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        
        if nanosecond != 0:
            other = other.replace(microsecond=0)  # Reset nanosecond
            
        n = self.n
        
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)  # Move to previous business day
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
        
        # Business day adjustments
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        # Remaining business hours adjustments
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        
        while bd != 0:
            other = self.next_bday.apply(other)  # Move to the next business day
            bd -= 1
        
        # Adjust based on remaining business hours
        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version aims to address the issues in the original function by properly handling the adjustments needed based on business hours and days.

By making these adjustments, the function should now return the expected values and types as specified in the test cases provided.
