The bug in the provided function `apply` lies in the calculation when adjusting the time based on business hours. The logic for adjusting the time intervals and business days is flawed, leading to incorrect outputs.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs due to incorrect adjustment of business days and remaining business hours. The issue arises when `n` is negative, and the logic for adjusting the time to the next business day and handling the remaining business hours is not properly implemented. This results in incorrect time adjustments and outputs.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for adjusting the time intervals and business days when `n` is negative and ensure correct calculations for remaining business hours. Additionally, the handling of `other` timestamp should be in alignment with the expected output.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            if self._is_on_offset(other):
                return other

            n = self.n
            o = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )

            if n >= 0:
                while n > 0:
                    o = self._next_opening_time(o)
                    n -= 1
            else:
                while n < 0:
                    o = o - timedelta(days=1)
                    if self._is_on_offset(o):
                        o = self._prev_opening_time(o)
                    else:
                        o = self._next_opening_time(o)
                        o = self._get_closing_time(o)

            return o
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying these corrections, the function should now handle the adjustment of time based on business hours correctly and produce the expected output for all the given test cases.
