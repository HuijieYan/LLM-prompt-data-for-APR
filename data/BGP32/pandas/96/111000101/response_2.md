The bug in the function lies in the calculations within the while loops. The adjustment of business hours remains incorrect, causing incorrect final results.

To fix this bug, we can modify the logic inside the while loops to properly adjust the dates and times based on business hours. Additionally, we should ensure that the calculations handle negative business hours accurately.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge conditions
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by second in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = self.next_bday.apply(other) + skip_bd

        if r != 0:
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n < 0:
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                    other -= bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other) - timedelta(1)
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should now handle the adjustments of business days and remaining business hours accurately based on the input parameters and expected output values in all the specified test cases.
