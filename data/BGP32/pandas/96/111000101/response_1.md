The buggy function contains an issue where the logic for adjusting the business hours is not correctly handling the calculations for moving between different business days. This leads to incorrect adjustments in the output.

The bug seems to be related to how the function handles adjusting business days when transitioning between different days. The function's logic for adjusting business hours within a day appears correct, but the logic for adjusting between different days needs refinement.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the handling of business days when moving between different days. We also need to ensure that the adjustments based on business hours within a day are correctly calculated.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # adjust time to match business hours window
        other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        n = self.n

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        # calculate the number of business days to adjust
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            current_business_day_hours = self._get_business_hours_by_sec(other.time(), self.end[0])
            if n >= 0:
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = min(bhour_remain, timedelta(seconds=current_business_day_hours))
                # finish adjusting if possible
                other += bhour
                bhour_remain -= bhour

                if bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    # move to next business time interval
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = min(bhour_remain, timedelta(seconds=current_business_day_hours))
                if bhour_remain == bhour and other.nanosecond == 0:
                    # if adjusting would just reach the start of the current interval
                    break
                # finish adjusting if possible
                other += bhour
                bhour_remain -= bhour

                if bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    # move to previous business time interval
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version addresses the issue with adjusting business days correctly and ensuring the adjustment of business hours within a day is accurate. The function structure remains the same as the original, with only the adjustment part being modified.
