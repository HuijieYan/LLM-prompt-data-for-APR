### Analysis:
The buggy function takes a Timestamp object as input and performs business hour adjustments based on certain conditions. The function adjusts the input timestamp by adding or subtracting business days and business hours.

The potential error locations within the buggy function could be in the calculation of business hours, adjustment of time intervals, and handling edge cases when adjusting business days.

The bug may be caused by incorrect logic when determining whether to add or subtract business days, or when adjusting business hours within each business time interval.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check the logic for adding and subtracting business days to ensure that the adjustments are correct for positive and negative values of n.
2. Verify the calculation of remaining business hours within each business time interval to accurately adjust the timestamp.

### Bug-fixed Code:

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected code should address the bug by ensuring correct adjustments of business days and business hours based on the input parameters. The adjustments are made in a loop to handle all remaining business hours within each business time interval.
