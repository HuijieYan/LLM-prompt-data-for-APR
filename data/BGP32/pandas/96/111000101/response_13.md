The bug in the provided function is related to the incorrect handling of business days and business hours adjustments. The function is supposed to adjust the given timestamp (other) based on a custom business hour, but there are errors in the logic for adjusting the timestamp within a business day and across multiple business days.

To fix this bug, the adjustments within the business day and across multiple business days need to be corrected. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from pandas.tseries.offsets import ApplyTypeError

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond
            )
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = self.next_bday.apply(other)
    
            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        break
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other) + timedelta(seconds=1)
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        break
                    else:
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should now properly adjust the timestamp based on the custom business hour provided. It takes into account adjustments within a business day and across multiple business days.
