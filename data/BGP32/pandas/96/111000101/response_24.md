### Analysis:
1. The `apply` function is defined inside the `BusinessHourMixin` class.
2. The function is meant to adjust the given timestamp based on business hours specified in the `CustomBusinessHour` class properties.
3. The bug seems to be related to adjusting business days and hours in a loop, resulting in incorrect output timestamps.
4. To fix the bug, we need to carefully adjust the business days and hours based on the provided business hours information.
  
### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. As we need to handle adjustments for both positive and negative `n` (number of business hours), we need to carefully consider conditions for adjusting business days and hours.
2. Correctly updating the timestamp `other` based on the business hours and days.
3. Making sure to handle edge cases properly, such as the start and end times of business hours.
4. Use appropriate conditional checks to determine when to move to the next business time interval.
5. Adjusting the timestamps by the remaining business hours after adjusting the business days.
  
### Bug Fixed Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                break
            else:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                bhour_remain -= bhour

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This revised function carefully handles adjustments for both positive and negative `n` values and appropriately adjusts the timestamp based on business hours specified in the `CustomBusinessHour` class. It addresses the issues identified in the buggy code.
