After analyzing the buggy function and the provided expected cases, it seems the bug lies in the condition where adjustments are made to the `other` datetime based on the `self.start` and `self.end` time intervals. The code has some logical errors related to handling positive and negative `self.n` values and business hour calculations.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for adjusting the `other` datetime based on the business hours specified in the `CustomBusinessHour` class instances. In particular, we need to handle cases where `self.n` is positive and negative separately to ensure correct adjustments.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# Import required libraries as mentioned in the original code snippet

def apply_wraps(func):
    pass

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    def next_bday(self):
        pass

    def _next_opening_time(self, other, sign=1):
        pass

    def _prev_opening_time(self, other):
        pass

    def _get_business_hours_by_sec(self, start, end):
        pass

    def _get_closing_time(self, dt):
        pass

    def is_on_offset(self, dt):
        pass

    def _is_on_offset(self, dt):
        pass

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function fixes the issues related to adjusting the `other` datetime based on positive and negative `self.n` values and ensures correct business hour calculations according to the provided expected cases.
