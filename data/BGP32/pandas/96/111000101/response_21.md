## Analysis:
1. The buggy function is intended to adjust the timestamp provided based on custom business hour rules, such as start time, end time, and holidays.
2. The function seems to have issues in adjusting the timestamp correctly when the provided timestamp falls within the business hours or on a holiday.
3. The bug appears to be related to the calculation logic inside the function, particularly in handling the adjustment of business days and remaining business hours.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments are made correctly based on the specified business hour rules.
5. A strategy for fixing the bug involves revising the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours, ensuring that the timestamp is correctly adjusted within the business hours.

## Solution:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        
        if self._is_on_offset(other):
            return other
        
        # Adjust the provided timestamp based on custom business hours
        if self.n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            
        while businesshours > 0:
            if self.n >= 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            businesshours -= 60
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the business day and remaining business hours correctly based on the business hour rules, the corrected function aims to provide the expected output for the provided test cases.
