## Analysis and Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `apply` is intended to adjust the specified datetime `other` by a certain number of business hours based on the rules provided by the `CustomBusinessHour` class. However, there are several issues in the implementation that prevent it from functioning correctly:
1. There is a missing import statement `from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay` that is required for the code to work properly.
2. The calculation of business hours in `businesshours` is incorrect since it divides by 60 unnecessarily.
3. The handling of adjusting by business days in the cases where `n` is negative or zero is not accurate.
4. The adjustment for remaining business hours does not consider the case where `bhour_remain` is greater than or equal to `bhour`.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Import the missing `BusinessDay` class to enable the correct functionality required for the adjustments.
2. Fix the calculation of `businesshours` by removing unnecessary division by 60.
3. Update the logic for adjusting by business days when `n` is negative or zero to ensure accurate adjustments.
4. Adjust the logic for remaining business hours to properly handle the case when `bhour_remain` is greater than or equal to `bhour`.

## Bug-fixed Version of the Function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay

# this is the bug-fixed version of the function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n), businesshours)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            remain = other - prev_open
            other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                # business hours left in this business time interval
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    # go to next business time interval
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                # business hours left in this business time interval
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    # go to next business time interval
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

The bug-fixed version of the `apply` function addresses the issues identified and should now correctly adjust the specified datetime by the provided CustomBusinessHour rules in all the expected test cases.
