The bug in the provided function involves the incorrect handling of adjusting the datetime `other` based on the business hours defined in the `CustomBusinessHour` class. The bug affects the calculation of the adjusted time when moving to the next business day and adjusting for remaining business hours.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments to `other` are correctly calculated based on the business hour intervals defined by `start` and `end` times and considering the direction of adjustment based on the value of `n`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python

# The buggy function has been fixed and provided the corrected version below:

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        # adjust other based on the direction of adjustment
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

            # adjust time based on remaining business hours
            if bhour_remain < bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

```

The corrected function now correctly adjusts the `other` datetime based on the specified business hours and the direction of adjustment (`n`). The adjustments for moving to the next business day and for the remaining business hours have been fixed to ensure the correct output based on the provided test cases.
