The buggy function is designed to apply business hour offsets to a given datetime value. The bug seems to be related to the calculation of the adjusted datetime when handling the business hour offsets. The issue could be caused by incorrect adjustments in the while loop while iterating over the remaining business hours.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments made in the while loops correctly handle the business hour intervals and properly adjust the datetime value. Specifically, we need to make sure that the calculations for moving to the next business time interval and the adjustment of remaining business hours are accurate.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
            closing_time = self._get_closing_time(next_opening)
            bhour = min(closing_time - other, bhour_remain)

            other += bhour
            bhour_remain -= bhour

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function should now properly handle the adjustments for the business hour offsets and satisfy the expected input/output values for the provided test cases.
