The buggy function has an issue with handling the adjustment of the input datetime object based on business hours. 
The bug occurs when trying to adjust the input datetime object to the next or previous opening time while considering the offset and business hours. The calculations to determine the business days and remaining hours are incorrect.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic for adjusting the datetime object based on business hours and handle the cases for positive and negative offsets differently.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# Import statements unchanged

# Following the fix, this function is used with corrected logic
def apply_wraps(func):
    # Please ignore the body of this function for simplicity

# Class declaration remains the same with the BusinessHourMixin

# The buggy function has been revised with corrected logic
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Calculating nanosecond for edge conditions
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        
        # Adjustment for timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() not in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n) * 60, businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other) + timedelta(days=1)
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other) - timedelta(days=1)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With the corrected version of the function, it should now handle the adjustment of the input datetime object based on business hours correctly and satisfy the expected input/output values for all the provided cases.
