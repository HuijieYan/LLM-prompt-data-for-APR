### Analysis:
The buggy function is supposed to apply a given business hour offset to a datetime object. It involves adjusting the datetime object based on the business hour definition provided. The bug seems to be related to the calculation of business days, remaining business hours, and adjustment of the datetime object accordingly.

### Identified Bug:
The bug lies in the part of the code where the adjustment for remaining business hours is done. The conditions and calculations for adjusting the time remaining within a business day are incorrect, resulting in unexpected behavior when applying the business hour offset.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the adjustment for business days is correctly calculated and applied.
2. Verify that the adjustment for remaining business hours within the same business day is accurate and handled properly for both positive and negative offset values.

### Corrected Code:
```python
from datetime import timedelta

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(hour=other.hour, minute=other.minute, second=other.second, microsecond=other.microsecond)
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday().is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected version of the function addresses the adjustment for business days and remaining business hours, following the expected logic outlined in the analysis. This should fix the bug and ensure the function returns the expected output in all identified cases.
