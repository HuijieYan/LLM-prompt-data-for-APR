The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the incorrect handling of business hours adjustment for datetime objects. The function is intended to adjust a given datetime based on business hours specified in the CustomBusinessHour object, but there are issues with the logic that leads to incorrect adjustments and output.

The main causes of the bug can be identified as:
1. Incorrect adjustment of the input datetime.
2. Mishandling of business hour intervals and remaining time.
3. Inconsistent adjustment logic for positive and negative business hour values.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the adjustment logic within the function to properly handle positive and negative business hours while respecting the business hour intervals set in the CustomBusinessHour object.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(nanosecond=0)
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() not in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        total_business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), total_business_hours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_opening = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_opening
                other = prev_opening + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and other.nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle the business hour adjustments correctly for both positive and negative business hours. It considers the business hour intervals, remaining time, and adjusts the input datetime accordingly.

Please test this corrected function with the provided test cases to verify that it produces the expected output and resolves the bug.
