### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class and is responsible for adjusting business hours based on input parameters.
2. The function performs calculations involving dates and times to adjust for business hours.
3. The bug seems to be related to the adjustment of business days and hours, which might be causing incorrect results.
4. A strategy for fixing the bug involves reassessing the logic for adjusting business days and hours and ensuring that the calculations are correct.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

### Corrected Version:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

        # Skipping business days if necessary
        if n != 0:
            curr_day = pd.Timestamp(other)
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=n)
            other = skip_bd.apply(curr_day)

    
        # Adjusting remaining business hours
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
    
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
    
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
    
        if r != 0:
            minutes_remaining = r
            current_time = other.time()
    
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end):
                start_time = datetime.combine(other, st)
                if current_time >= st and current_time < en:
                    diff_sec = (en.hour * 3600 + en.minute * 60) - (current_time.hour * 3600 + current_time.minute * 60)
    
                    if minutes_remaining <= diff_sec / 60:
                        other = start_time + timedelta(minutes=minutes_remaining)
                        break
                    else:
                        minutes_remaining -= diff_sec / 60
                        current_time = en
    
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function adjusts business days first and then handles the remaining business hours more accurately based on the start and end times of the business window. It should now correctly adjust the input datetime based on the specified business hours and days.
