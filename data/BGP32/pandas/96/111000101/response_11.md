### Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is designed to adjust datetime values based on a set of business hours. However, there is an issue in the logic related to adjusting the datetime value within business hours. The function is expected to handle specific inputs for `other` (datetime) and `self` (CustomBusinessHour). It adjusts the input datetime according to the specified business rules.

The potential error lies in the logic for adjusting the datetime `other` within the business hours defined by `self`. The function tries to calculate the adjusted datetime while considering business days, remaining business hours, and specific business time intervals.

### Bug Explanation
1. The function incorrectly handles the adjustment of `other` when the number of business hours `n` is negative. It fails to correctly adjust the `other` datetime when falling within the specified business hours.
2. There are issues with adjusting the remaining business hours within a business time interval, leading to incorrect calculations.
3. The logic for handling `self.next_bday` is not functioning as expected, causing incorrect adjustments in certain cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Correct the logic for adjusting the `other` datetime when `n` is negative to ensure the correct behavior when the datetime falls within the specific business hours.
2. Adjust the calculation of remaining business hours within business time intervals to accurately update the `other` datetime.
3. Address the handling of `self.next_bday` to ensure correct adjustments on business days.

### Bug-Fixed Function
```python
# import necessary libraries if needed

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # other functions within the class

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
          
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function should now properly adjust the datetime values within the specified business hours based on the given inputs and expected cases.
