The buggy function has an issue with adjusting the `other` datetime based on the input parameters and conditions. The main problem arises from the incorrect adjustment of `other` when the value of `self.n` is negative.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments made to the `other` datetime object are correctly aligned with the logic of moving to the next opening time and the total business hours calculation.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = skip_bd.rollforward(other)

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self.end[0] - other.time() if other.time() in self.start else self.start[0] - other.time()
            else:
                bhour = self.end[0] - other.time() if other.time() in self.end else self.start[0] - other.time()

            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                # finish adjusting if possible
                other += bhour_remain
                break
            else:
                # go to next business time interval
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version follows the expected logic for adjusting the datetime based on the given business hours. It ensures the correct movement across business days and intervals based on the input parameters and conditions.
