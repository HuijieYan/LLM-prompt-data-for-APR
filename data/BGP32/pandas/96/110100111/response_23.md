### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `BusinessHourMixin` file. It involves business hour calculations based on specified parameters.
2. The function applies business hour offsets to given datetime values and adjusts them accordingly.
3. The bug likely arises from the incorrect handling of the `next_bday` attribute when computing business day offsets with respect to holidays.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments for holidays correctly skip the holiday dates in the computations of business days.
5. We will update the logic related to `next_bday` and the adjustment steps within the function to address the bug.

### Summary:
- The corrected version of the function now incorporates proper handling of holidays when calculating business day offsets.
- The adjustments for holidays with `next_bday` ensure skipping holiday dates in the computations.
- The corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values as outlined.
