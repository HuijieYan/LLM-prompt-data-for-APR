### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply()` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class which inherits from `BusinessMixin`.
2. The function takes a datetime object `other` as input and performs calculations based on the business hours defined in the class.
3. The buggy behavior is identified in scenarios where the function adds extra periods when a holiday is specified in the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency.
4. The buggy behavior is relevant to the GitHub issue where `pd.date_range` produces unexpected results when using periods and adding a holiday to the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the current implementation is related to the incorrect calculation and adjustment of business days and business hours, leading to an off-by-one error scenario. When a holiday is encountered, the adjustments based on business days and remaining business hours are not handled correctly.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the calculations related to business days and remaining business hours to ensure accurate adjustments when holidays are involved.
2. Check the conditions for incrementing or decrementing business days and handle the transition between business days more precisely.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            business_hours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other += skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        break
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        break
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the logic for business days and remaining business hours within the corrected `apply()` function, the off-by-one error causing extra periods to be calculated in case of holidays should be resolved.
