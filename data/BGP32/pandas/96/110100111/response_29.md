### Analysis
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the class `BusinessHourMixin` which inherits from `BusinessMixin`.
2. The buggy function seems to be an implementation for applying business hour offsets to datetime objects.
3. The test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` encounters an issue when trying to create a date range with custom business hours and holidays.
4. The expected input/output values for the failing test function are provided, and the GitHub issue indicates the problem of incorrect period count when using periods and adding a holiday.
5. The bug seems to be related to how the holiday is processed within the `CustomBusinessHour` logic.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the `n` (number of business hours) is positive, and a check is made to adjust the `other` datetime based on whether it falls on an open hour or not. If not, it is adjusted to the next opening time. However, when a holiday is encountered, the function doesn't handle it correctly, which leads to the incorrect calculation of periods in the date range.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how holidays are considered within the logic of checking and adjusting the `other` datetime. Specifically, when a holiday is encountered, instead of simply proceeding with the adjustment to the next opening time, we need to skip the holiday and then proceed as usual.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() not in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                
                while other in self.holidays:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                while other in self.holidays:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # The remaining logic remains the same
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adding a check to skip holidays after adjusting the `other` datetime to the next opening time, this updated logic should handle holidays correctly and resolve the issue of incorrect period counts in the date range function.
