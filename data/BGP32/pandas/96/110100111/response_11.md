### Analysis
1. The buggy function, `apply`, is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which is a subclass of `BusinessMixin`.
2. The function takes a `datetime` object `other` as input.
3. The function performs calculations based on the input `datetime` and the attributes of the class to determine a new date/time.
4. The bug seems to be related to calculating business hours and adjusting the input `datetime` accordingly.
5. The failing test, `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`, is related to a GitHub issue where the date range behavior is inconsistent when using periods and adding holidays in the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency scenario.

### Bug Explanation
1. The bug seems to be related to the handling of holidays within the `apply` function.
2. When the function encounters a holiday in the date range calculation, it does not adjust the output correctly, leading to an incorrect number of periods.
3. This causes the output timestamp to include additional periods beyond what was specified.
4. The bug affects the logic of adjusting business hours around holidays, leading to incorrect date ranges.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that holidays are correctly handled within the calculation of business hours.
2. Adjust the logic around holidays to ensure that the number of periods in the date range is accurate even when holidays are present.
3. Validate and adjust the business hour calculations based on the holiday presence to prevent extra periods in the output.

```

By incorporating the adjustments to the handling of holidays and ensuring proper adjustments around holiday periods, the corrected version of the `apply` function should now pass the failing test and match the expected input/output values.
