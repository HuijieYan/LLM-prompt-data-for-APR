### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class. It applies business hours to a datetime object, adjusting it to the nearest business hours.
2. The issue is related to custom business hours not being correctly handled when holidays are provided. The buggy function does not correctly adjust the datetime to skip holidays while applying business hours.
3. The failing test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is meant to create a date range using custom business hours with a holiday specified. The expected output is incorrect due to the bug in the `apply` function.
4. To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly skip holidays while adjusting the datetime to the nearest business hours.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `apply` function fails to properly handle holidays while adjusting the datetime to the next business hours. This results in incorrect calculations when holidays are involved, leading to an incorrect output in the test case.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Check if the given datetime is on a holiday, and if so, skip it while applying business hours.
2. Update the adjustment logic to correctly handle the case where the given datetime falls on a holiday.
3. Ensure that the holiday is taken into account when adjusting the datetime to the nearest business hours.

### Corrected Function:
```python

    @apply_wraps
