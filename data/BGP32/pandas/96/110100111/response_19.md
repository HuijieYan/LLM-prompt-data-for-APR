### Analysis:
1. The provided buggy function is `apply()` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in `pandas/tseries/offsets.py`.
2. The function aims to adjust the input datetime based on business hours, considering opening and closing times, holidays, and weekends.
3. The failing test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays()` in `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py` demonstrates the issue with custom business hours and holidays where the output differs from the expected values.
4. The bug causes the dates generated by `pd.date_range()` to be incorrect when custom business hours with holidays are used, resulting in an unexpected increase in periods.
5. The bug seems to stem from how the adjustment of business hours for holidays is handled, leading to incorrect business days and subsequent date calculations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the adjustment of datetimes based on business hours considers holidays correctly.
2. Evaluate the logic for adjusting business days and hours for positive and negative values of `n`.
3. Check the adjustments made to datetime objects to confirm they align with the intended business hour operations.
4. Correct the calculation of business days and remaining hours to ensure the proper adjustment of dates.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            if n > 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            if self._is_holiday(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
               
            adjusted = self._adjust_for_holidays(other)

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            adjusted = self._adjust_business_days(adjusted, bd)

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            adjusted = self._adjust_business_hours(adjusted, bhour_remain, n)

            return adjusted

    def _is_holiday(self, dt):
        return dt.date() in self.holidays

    def _adjust_for_holidays(self, dt):
        while self._is_holiday(dt):
            dt = self._next_opening_time(dt)
        return dt

    def _adjust_business_days(self, dt, bd):
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(dt):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(dt)
                remain = dt - prev_open
                dt = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                dt = dt + skip_bd
        return dt

    def _adjust_business_hours(self, dt, bhour_remain, n):
        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._get_business_time(dt, n)
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                dt += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                dt = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(dt + bhour))
        return dt

    def _get_business_time(self, dt, n):
        if n >= 0:
            return self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(dt)) - dt
        else:
            return self._next_opening_time(dt) - dt
```

In the corrected version, the handling of holidays and adjustments for business days and hours have been modified. The functions `_is_holiday()`, `_adjust_for_holidays()`, `_adjust_business_days()`, and `_adjust_business_hours()` are added to improve the handling of holiday dates and adjustments based on business hours. The logic for adjusting business days and hours based on the input parameters has been updated to ensure the correct output is generated.
