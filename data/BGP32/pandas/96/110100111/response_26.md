### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which is used to adjust the given timestamp according to the business hours offsets.
2. The failing test case involves custom business hours starting at 15:00 with a holiday on 2020-11-26. The expected output of the test indicates the issue causing additional periods being added due to the holiday.
3. The bug is related to incorrect adjustment of timestamps when a holiday is present, leading to the unexpected outcome in the test case mentioned in the GitHub issue.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustment for business hours correctly handles holidays to prevent the additional periods in the returns.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function fails to properly adjust business hours when a holiday is encountered, leading to incorrect results in the presence of holidays.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `apply` function to account for holidays correctly and adjust the timestamps accordingly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour, ApplyTypeError
import pandas._libs.tslibs.offsets as offsets
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Adjust for timezone and nano seconds
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            
            n = self.n
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # Adjust for business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = pd.offsets.CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not skip_bd.onOffset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            bhour_s = pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour(
                start=self.start[0],
                n=0,
                weekmask=self.weekmask,
                holidays=self.holidays
            )

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(bhour_s._add_offset(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the holiday handling logic and correctly adjusting the timestamps within the business hours, the corrected version of the `apply` function should now pass the failing test case and align with the expected output specified in the GitHub issue.
