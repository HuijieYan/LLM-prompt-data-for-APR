### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is intended to adjust a datetime object based on business hours and various conditions.
   
2. The issues relate to the way holidays are handled, causing unexpected behavior in the calculation of business hours.

### Bug Identification:
1. The bug stems from the incorrect handling of holidays when adjusting business hours.
2. The issue arises when the code is trying to adjust the business days based on holidays, leading to additional periods being added unintentionally.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic related to how holidays are accounted for during the adjustment process.
2. Ensure that holidays are taken into consideration correctly to prevent the addition of extra periods.
3. Check and update the logic for adjusting business days to account for holidays effectively.

### Bug-fixed code:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            self._adjust_for_holidays(other)
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
            self._adjust_for_business_days(bd, other)
            self._adjust_for_remaining_hours(r, other)
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

    def _adjust_for_holidays(self, other):
        if other in self.holidays:
            other += np.timedelta64(1, 'D')
    
    def _adjust_for_business_days(self, bd, other):
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

    def _adjust_for_remaining_hours(self, r, other):
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        if r >= 0:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
```

By updating the `_adjust_for_holidays`, `_adjust_for_business_days`, and `_adjust_for_remaining_hours` methods, we ensure a correct adjustment for holidays and business days while preserving the expected behavior of the business hour application.
