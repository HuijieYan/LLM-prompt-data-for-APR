### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is supposed to adjust a given datetime object based on business hours and given conditions.
2. The buggy function is related to the `CustomBusinessHour` class and is used in a test that fails to produce the expected output.
3. The buggy function fails because it does not correctly handle the case when holidays are provided, resulting in an incorrect number of periods being generated in the date range.
4. To fix the bug, the function needs to properly account for holidays while adjusting the datetime object based on business hours.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check the logic for handling the application of business hours, especially when holidays are involved.
2. Adjust the function to correctly skip holidays and adjust the datetime object accordingly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            if self._is_holiday(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            if n >= 0:
                while n > 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    n -= 1
            else:
                while n < 0:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    n += 1

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version now properly skips holidays and adjusts the datetime object based on the provided business hours. It should resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report and pass the failing test cases.
