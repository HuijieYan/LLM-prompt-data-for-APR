### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas` library. The function takes a timestamp `other` as input and performs operations based on certain conditions. The bug seems to occur when adjusting the timestamp based on business days and business hours.

### Identified Potential Errors:
1. Incorrect adjustment of business days in the negative case.
2. Incorrectly calculating the remaining business hours to adjust.

### Bug Explanation:
The failing test case involves a `CustomBusinessHour` instance with a start time of 15:00 and a holiday on November 26, 2020. The expected output is a `DatetimeIndex` with specific timestamps at custom business hours. However, due to the bug within the `apply` function, the output in the failing test introduces additional periods beyond the expected 4 periods, specifically after the holiday.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Correct the adjustment for negative business days to ensure the timestamp is adjusted accurately when the business hour starts.
2. Revisit the logic for calculating the remaining business hours to adjust, making sure it aligns with the intended behavior.

The provided corrected version applies the necessary corrections to address the identified errors in adjusting for negative business days and calculating the remaining business hours when adjusting the timestamp.

By making these changes, the corrected version should resolve the bug encountered in the failing test case while aligning with the expected input/output values and resolving the GitHub issue.
