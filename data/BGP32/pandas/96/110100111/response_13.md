### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is a method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class which is a subclass of `BusinessMixin`.
2. The function is used to apply a custom business hour offset to a given datetime object.
3. The buggy function has issues related to adjusting business days and business hours, leading to incorrect results when adding holidays.
4. The GitHub issue describes a specific scenario where the `pd.date_range` function behaves unexpectedly when using periods and adding holidays.
5. The issue is linked to the incorrect behavior of the `CustomBusinessHour` offset when processing holidays and periods.

### Bug in the Function:
The bug is caused by incorrect handling of adjustments related to business days and inefficient processing of business hours. This leads to unexpected results when adding holidays or adjusting for a given number of periods.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Improve the logic for adjusting business days and hours.
2. Enhance the handling of holidays to prevent unexpected changes in the date_range result.
3. Ensure that the function accounts for periods correctly and retains the expected behavior even with holidays.

### Correction of the Buggy Function:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessMixin, apply_wraps, ApplyTypeError
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                other = other - self._get_closing_time(other)

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            # Adjust the working hours using business day value
            other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                else:
                    bhour = other - self._next_opening_time(other)

                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    if n >= 0:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                    else:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By updating the logic for adjusting business days and hours in the `apply` function, we can ensure that the custom business hour offset works correctly with `pd.date_range`, even when holidays are specified.
