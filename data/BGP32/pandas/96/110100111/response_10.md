### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is responsible for adjusting dates and times based on business hours. The function seems to be causing issues related to handling holidays and edge cases, as identified in the failing test case provided. The function should correctly adjust the date and time based on the specified business hours, taking into account weekends and holidays.

### Errors:
1. The function may not be correctly handling holidays, causing the output to be incorrect.
2. The adjustments for business days and business hours might not be properly calculated, leading to unexpected results.
3. There may be issues with the logic for moving to the next or previous business day.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of holidays in the `apply` function. When a holiday falls within the specified business hours, the function fails to adjust the dates and times according to the desired behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles holidays and adjusts the dates and times based on the specified business hours. Additionally, the logic for moving to the next or previous business day needs to be reviewed and corrected.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# Assuming the import statements are maintained as provided in the prompt

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
            
            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        break
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        break
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By ensuring that holidays are properly handled and adjusting the dates and times based on the specified business hours, the corrected version of the `apply` function should now pass the failing test case and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
