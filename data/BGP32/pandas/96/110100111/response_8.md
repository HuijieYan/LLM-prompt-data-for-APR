### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is responsible for adjusting datetime values according to business hours. The issue arises when incorporating holidays in the calculation, leading to an unexpected number of periods in the output.
2. The potential error locations in the function include the calculations related to adjusting business days and business hours.
3. The bug causes the function to miscalculate the adjusted datetime value when a holiday is involved, leading to an incorrect number of periods in the output. This deviates from the expected behavior of adjusting datetime values based on business hours and holidays.
4. To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for adjusting datetime values while considering holidays, ensuring that the correct number of periods is included in the output.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `apply` function that addresses the bug:

### Corrected Version:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            initial_time = other.time()
            if n >= 0:
                if initial_time in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if initial_time in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # remaining business hours to adjust
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
            remaining_hours = abs(n) * 60
            reverse_sign = 1 if n >= 0 else -1

            # adjust by business days first
            if n != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=n)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd

            # adjust remaining business hours
            while remaining_hours != 0:
                next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                else:
                    bhour = next_opening - other

                if remaining_hours >= bhour.total_seconds() // 60:
                    other += bhour
                    remaining_hours -= bhour.total_seconds() // 60
                else:
                    other += timedelta(minutes=remaining_hours)
                    remaining_hours = 0

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the business hours and days correctly, considering the effect of holidays, the corrected function will now handle the calculation of periods in `date_range` effectively, resolving the issue indicated on GitHub.
