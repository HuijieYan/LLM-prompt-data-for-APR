### Analysis
- The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which is related to handling business hours in pandas.
- The failing test code `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is meant to test custom business hours handling with holidays.
- The expected output values provided in the test correspond to the correct behavior when dealing with custom business hours and holidays.
- The GitHub issue is related to using `date_range` with custom business hours and holidays resulting in unexpected periods being generated.

### Bug Cause
1. The bug in the `apply` function results from incorrect handling of holidays during adjustments, leading to unexpected periods being generated.
2. The bug causes the function to miscalculate the adjusted business hours when encountering holidays, resulting in outputs with more periods than expected.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the logic for adjusting dates around holidays to correctly handle the impact of holidays on business hours calculations.
2. Adjust the logic around holidays to ensure that the periods are calculated correctly, accounting for the impact of holidays.

### Bug-fixed Function
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        other = self.apply_round(other)
        
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            other = self.apply_businessdays(other, bd)

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            other = self.adjust_positive_hours(other, bhour_remain)
        else:
            other = self.adjust_negative_hours(other, bhour_remain)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Summary
The bug in the `apply` function was addressed by modifying the adjustment logic to correctly handle periods around holidays, ensuring the expected behavior when using custom business hours and holidays with `date_range`.
