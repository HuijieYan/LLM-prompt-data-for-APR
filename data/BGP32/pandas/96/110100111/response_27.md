### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the class `BusinessHourMixin`, which is related to working with business hours and business days.
2. The function takes a datetime object `other` as input and performs adjustments based on the business hours and holidays defined in its instance variables.
3. The bug is related to the incorrect handling of holidays causing the date range to expand beyond the expected periods.
4. The bug leads to unexpected behavior in creating date ranges when combining business hours and holidays.
5. The fix should involve adjusting the logic for handling holidays within the `apply` function to ensure the correct calculation of business hours while considering holidays.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Identify the point of holiday consideration and make necessary adjustments.
2. Properly integrate holiday handling in the logic related to adjusting the business hours.
3. Ensure that the function correctly calculates the next opening and closing times accounting for holidays.

The fixed version of the `apply` function includes adjustments to properly handle holidays, preventing the unexpected expansion of date ranges beyond the specified periods. This fix ensures that the function correctly calculates the next opening and closing times while considering holidays.
