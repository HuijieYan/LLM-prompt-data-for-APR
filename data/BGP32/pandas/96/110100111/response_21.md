### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is a method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which is a subclass of `BusinessMixin`.
2. The function is designed to adjust date and time values based on business hours, taking into account start and end times, holidays, and other business day constraints.
3. The buggy function fails when used with `CustomBusinessHour` objects containing holidays.
4. The failing test case in the `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` test function uses a `CustomBusinessHour` frequency with a holiday set, highlighting the issue.
5. The bug causes the resulting date range to have more periods than expected due to the improper handling of holidays in the business hour adjustment logic.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function fails to adjust for holidays correctly in the calculation of business hours and transitions between business days. This leads to incorrect results in cases where holidays impact the business hours calculation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic related to adjusting dates and times in the presence of holidays within the `apply` function.
2. Ensure that holidays are properly accounted for when calculating business hours and transitioning between business days.
3. Make adjustments based on both the holiday dates and the regular business hours to correct the bug.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
from datetime import timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            
            n = self.n
            if n < 0:
                n = -n
            
            if n == 0:
                return other
            
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            
            # Adjust for holidays properly
            for _ in range(n):
                while True:
                    if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                        if other in self.holidays:
                            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                        else:
                            break
            
            return other
        
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By incorporating a loop to handle adjustments for holidays and ensuring that the business hours calculation considers holiday dates, the corrected version of the `apply` function should successfully address the bug related to excess periods in the date range with holidays.
