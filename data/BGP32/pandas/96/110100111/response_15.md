### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class which inherits from `BusinessMixin`.
2. The function appears to modify the `other` datetime object based on certain conditions related to business hours, weekdays, and holidays.
3. The buggy function is currently misbehaving when adjusting the input datetime object according to business hours and holidays, leading to incorrect output.
4. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` aims to check if the date range generation with custom business hours and holidays works correctly, which it currently does not due to the bug.
5. The bug is reported on GitHub with the title "Pandas date_range does not work when using periods and adding holiday".

### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `apply` incorrectly handles adjustments for business hours, holidays, and weekdays. This leads to the function returning incorrect datetime values when dealing with custom business hours and holidays. The bug may be related to how the function calculates business days and remaining business hours.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
The bug fix strategy involves properly handling the adjustments for business days, remaining business hours, and transitioning between business time intervals. Correct adjustments based on the specified business hours and holidays are crucial for the function to return the expected datetime values.

### Code Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
            
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            for _ in range(abs(n)):
                while other.weekday() >= 5 or other in self.holidays:
                    other += timedelta(days=1) if n >= 0 else timedelta(days=-1)
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making sure that the adjustments for business days and holidays are correctly handled, the corrected function should now produce the expected output for the failing test case.
