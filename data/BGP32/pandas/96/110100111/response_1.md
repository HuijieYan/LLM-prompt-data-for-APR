### Analysis
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `BusinessHourMixin` class.
2. The function processes a `datetime` object with adjustment based on business hours.
3. The bug seems to be related to incorrect adjustment of dates based on business hours when holidays are involved.
4. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays()` is affected by this bug.
5. The expected input/output values provided for the failing test show the incorrect date adjustments.
6. The GitHub issue highlights a similar problem with `pd.date_range` when using periods and adding holidays.

### Bug Cause
The bug seems to arise due to the incorrect adjustment of dates when a holiday falls within the specified business hours, leading to additional periods being added to the date range.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Check the logic for adjusting the dates when holidays are involved.
2. Ensure that the adjustment correctly handles cases where holidays might affect the business hours.
3. Make necessary corrections to the adjustment process to align with the expected behavior.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
import pandas as pd

from pandas.tseries.frequencies import apply_wraps
from pandas.tseries.offsets import apply_wraps
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay
from pandas._libs.tslibs.offsets import ApplyTypeError
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin:
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            n = self.n

            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to the previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = other + skip_bd

            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    if bhour_remain < bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other -= bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With these corrected adjustments, the function should now handle the date adjustments appropriately, passing the failing test and aligning with the expected input/output values.
