### Analysis:
1. The buggy code is a part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The function is supposed to apply business hours to a given datetime object. It uses various calculations to adjust the datetime by business days and hours.
3. The failing test is related to custom business hours with holidays not being correctly applied when using `pd.date_range`. The issue involves incorrect period allocation due to holidays.
4. The bug likely occurs due to improper calculation and management of holidays within the business hours adjustment process.
5. The fix involves accurately handling the holidays in alignment with the custom business hours to ensure the correct adjustment.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic to properly account for holidays when adjusting datetime with custom business hours.
2. Ensure that the adjustment for holidays does not interfere with the expected period count.
3. Refactor the holiday handling mechanism within the function to align it correctly with the business hours adjustment.
4. Test the fixed function against the failing test cases to ensure proper behavior.

### Corrected Function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            if self.holidays is not None:
                for holiday_date in self.holidays:
                    if holiday_date == other:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            
            if n >= 0:
                if self.weekmask[other.weekday()] == '1' or other.time() in self.start:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                elif self.weekmask[other.weekday()] == '1':
                    other = other - timedelta(days=1)
                
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
            
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
            
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By updating the logic for handling holidays within the business hour adjustment process and ensuring correct adjustments, this corrected function should address the issue with custom business hours and holidays in the failing test case.
