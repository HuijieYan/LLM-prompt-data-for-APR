### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is a method within the `BusinessHourMixin` class.
2. The function is designed to adjust a given datetime object based on the specified business hours.
3. The issue arises when there are holidays involved in the calculation, causing unexpected behavior in the date range generation.
4. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` tries to create a date range with custom business hours and holidays.
5. The expected behavior is to return the date range with correct adjusted timings based on the specified business hours and holidays.

### Bug Cause:
- The issue arises due to incorrect handling of holidays in the `apply` function, leading to unexpected results in the date range calculation.
- The current logic fails to correctly adjust the datetime based on the business hours and holidays, resulting in incorrect dates in the output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the logic in the `apply` function to correctly adjust the datetime considering the specified business hours and holidays.
- Handle the adjustments for holidays in a way that aligns with the expected behavior of the date range generation.
- Ensure that the adjusted datetime falls within the specified business hours and accounts for holidays appropriately.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
from pandas.compat import u

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            if not self.on_offset(other):
                other = self.rollforward(other)
            n = self.n
            adjusted = other
            direction = 1 if n >= 0 else -1
            for _ in range(abs(n)):
                adjusted = self.apply_delta(adjusted, direction)
            return adjusted
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying the corrections to the `apply` function, the logic should now correctly adjust the datetime based on the business hours specified, including handling holidays appropriately. This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure the expected behavior of the date range generation.
