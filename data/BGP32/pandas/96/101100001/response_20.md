## Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is intended to apply custom business hours to a given datetime object. The function contains logic to adjust the datetime object based on the specified business hours.

Potential errors:
1. The adjustment logic for negative `n` values seems incorrect.
2. Handling business days and remaining business hours could be causing issues.

Cause of the bug:
The bug likely stems from incorrect adjustment logic when `n` is negative, leading to the incorrect output in certain scenarios. The bug causes the failing test case to not produce the expected result.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Review and correct the adjustment logic for negative `n` values.
2. Ensure proper handling of business days and remaining business hours during adjustments.
3. Make necessary changes to handle edge cases effectively.

## Corrected Version of the `apply` function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # other functions remain the same
    
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

                if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    if n >= 0:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                    else:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected version of the `apply` function should now handle both positive and negative `n` values correctly, leading to the expected output for the failing test case.
