## Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class and is decorated with `@apply_wraps`. The function is designed to adjust a given datetime value based on business hours specified in the object instance. The function has a bug that causes it to incorrectly handle negative adjustments, resulting in incorrect output and failing the test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.

## Error Location
The bug is located in the section of the code where the function handles negative adjustments (`if n < 0`). The logic for adjusting the datetime value for negative adjustments is causing the incorrect behavior.

## Bug Explanation
The bug arises when the function tries to adjust the datetime value for negative offsets. The logic for adjusting the date, moving to the previous day, and then finding the next opening time and closing time is flawed. This leads to incorrect results when calculating the adjusted datetime value based on negative offsets.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic for handling negative adjustments in the `apply` function. Specifically, the adjustment process for negative offsets should be carefully revised to ensure correct computation of the adjusted datetime value.

## Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function with the bug fixed:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if (
                        bhour_remain < bhour 
                        or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0)
                    ):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the adjustment logic for negative offsets, the function should now correctly adjust datetime values based on business hours specified in the object instance. This corrected version should pass the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.
