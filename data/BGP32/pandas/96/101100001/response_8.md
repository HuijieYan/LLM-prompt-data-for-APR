### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is a method within the `BusinessHourMixin` class.
2. It takes an argument `other` and performs a series of calculations based on this input.
3. The bug seems to reside in the calculation logic when adjusting the datetime based on the business hours and days.
4. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is related to creating a date range with custom business hours and holidays using `CustomBusinessHour` offset.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The buggy function `apply` is not correctly adjusting the datetime based on the specified business hours and days.
2. The logic for adjusting the datetime when the number of business days (`bd`) is non-zero or the remaining business hours (`bhour_remain`) needs adjustment is faulty.
3. This incorrect logic leads to the failing of the test case as the resulting date range does not match the expected output.

### Approach for Fix:
1. Correct the logic within the `apply` method to properly adjust the datetime based on the specified business hours and days.
2. Focus on adjusting the datetime based on the business days (`bd`) and remaining business hours (`bhour_remain`) in a way that aligns with the business hour intervals and opening/closing times.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function 'apply'
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        initial_datetime = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n
        
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        businesshours_per_day = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours_per_day // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
            
        if bd != 0:
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + BusinessDay(n=bd) + remain
            else:
                other += BusinessDay(n=bd)
        
        while r != 0:
            if n >= 0:
                b_hour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if r < b_hour.total_seconds() / 60:
                    other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                    r = 0
                else:
                    r -= b_hour.total_seconds() / 60
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + b_hour)
            else:
                b_hour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if r > b_hour.total_seconds() / 60 or (r == b_hour.total_seconds() / 60 and initial_datetime.nanosecond != 0):
                    other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                    r = 0
                else:
                    r -= b_hour.total_seconds() / 60
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + b_hour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By using the corrected version of the `apply` method provided above, the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` should now pass successfully.
