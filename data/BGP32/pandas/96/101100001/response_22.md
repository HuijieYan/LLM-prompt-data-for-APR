## Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class has several issues that need to be addressed:
1. The logic for handling negative offset values is incorrect.
2. There are inconsistencies in adjusting the time based on the business hours.
3. There are potential issues with adjusting the business days.

## Identified Bugs:
1. Incorrect handling of negative offset values.
2. Inconsistencies in adjusting the time based on business hours.
3. Potential issues with adjusting business days when the time falls on a holiday.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Fix the logic for handling negative offset values.
2. Ensure consistency in adjusting the time based on business hours.
3. Improve the logic for adjusting business days to ensure accuracy.

## Updated and Corrected Function:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # Existing functions...
  
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                else:
                    bhour = other - self._next_opening_time(other)
                
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                else:
                    break

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying these corrections, the `apply` function should now handle negative offset values, adjust the time consistently based on business hours, and adjust business days accurately.
