### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is supposed to adjust a datetime object based on business hours specified by the class instance.
2. The buggy function contains logic to adjust the input datetime object based on the specified business hours and number of business hours provided.
3. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect adjustment of the datetime object `other` within the function based on the specified business hours.
4. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is meant to create a date range with custom business hours starting at 15:00 and a holiday on November 26, 2020, to verify if the corrected behavior is achieved.

### Bug:
The bug in the current implementation of the `apply` function lies in the incorrect adjustment logic applied to the `other` datetime object based on the specified business hours. This leads to the incorrect output in certain scenarios.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the adjustments made to the `other` datetime object are correct based on the specified business hours and the number of business hours.
2. Verify the behavior when adjusting for negative business hours and handling edge cases appropriately.
3. Maintain consistency in handling different scenarios when adjusting the datetime object.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessMixin, ApplyTypeError, BusinessDay
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    other = other.normalize()
                other = other + skip_bd
    
            other_time = other.time()
            if n >= 0:
                while r:
                    if other_time in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = other + timedelta(hours=1)
                    else:
                        r -= 60
            else:
                while r:
                    if other_time not in self.start:
                        other = other - timedelta(hours=1)
                    if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                        other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                    r += 60
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected version of the `apply` function applies the adjustments properly based on the number of business hours (`n`) and the specified business hours `start` and `end`. It also handles edge cases appropriately to ensure the correct datetime output based on the business hour offsets.
