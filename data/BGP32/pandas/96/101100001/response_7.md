## Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is supposed to adjust a given `datetime` object based on the business hours defined by the `CustomBusinessHour` offset. The function seems to have issues related to handling the business hours correctly, leading to incorrect adjustments.

## Identified issues:
1. Incorrect adjustment of `datetime` object based on business hours.
2. Inconsistencies in handling positive and negative offsets.
3. Potential errors in calculating business days and remaining business hours.

## Bug Cause:
The bug seems to be caused by incorrect logic in adjusting the `datetime` object based on business hours, especially when handling positive vs. negative offsets and business day adjustments.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic for adjusting the given `datetime` object based on business hours for both positive and negative offsets.
2. Ensure correct calculation of business days and remaining business hours.
3. Rectify any inconsistencies in handling different scenarios for adjustment.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other += skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    bhour = other - self._next_opening_time(other)
                    if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                        other -= bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._prev_opening_time(other - bhour)
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By updating the adjustment logic and ensuring consistency in handling different scenarios, the corrected version of the `apply` function should now pass the failing test.
