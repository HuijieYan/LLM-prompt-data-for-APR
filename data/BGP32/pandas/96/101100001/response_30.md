## Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is causing the test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` to fail. The function is intended to apply a business hour offset to a given datetime, but it has several issues related to the calculation and adjustment of time intervals.

## Issues:
1. The calculation of `bd, r` might lead to incorrect results for negative values of `n`.
2. The adjustment logic based on business days (`skip_bd`) is not handling all edge cases correctly.
3. The adjustment of remaining business hours (`bhour_remain`) is not accurate and may lead to incorrect results.
4. The final adjustment logic based on positive and negative offsets is flawed and can give wrong results.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Improve the calculation of `bd, r` to handle negative values of `n` correctly.
2. Revise the logic for adjusting business days (`skip_bd`) to ensure correct handling of business days.
3. Refine the adjustment of remaining business hours (`bhour_remain`) for accurate results.
4. Rewrite the final adjustment logic to handle both positive and negative offsets appropriately.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = other.replace(nanosecond=0)
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other) + skip_bd
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            while r != 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other if n >= 0 else self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if abs(r * 60) <= bhour.seconds // 60:
                    other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                    r = 0
                else:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    r = r - (bhour.seconds // 60)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With these corrections in place, the `apply` function should now handle the business hour offset adjustments correctly and pass the failing test case.
