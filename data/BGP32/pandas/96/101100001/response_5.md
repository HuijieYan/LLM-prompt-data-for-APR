### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is supposed to adjust a given datetime object based on the business hours specified by the `BusinessHourMixin` class.
2. The bug seems to be related to the handling of negative business hours (`n < 0`).
3. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` provides a scenario where the bug can be reproduced.
4. The bug occurs when adjusting the datetime object for negative business hours, causing incorrect results.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the section of the `apply` function where it handles negative business hours. In this case, the adjustment process to move to the previous business day and obtain the closing time is incorrect. This leads to the wrongly calculated adjustment for negative business hours.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Correct the calculation and adjustment logic for negative business hours in the `apply` function to ensure the datetime object is adjusted correctly.
2. Identify the specific areas of code related to negative business hour adjustments and make the necessary changes based on the logic of moving to the previous business day.
3. Verify the fix by running the failing test to ensure the corrected function passes the test.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Original code
        # If n >= 0 case handling goes here with some checks
        
        n = self.n
        
        # If n < 0 case handling
        if n < 0:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(days=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                
        # Remaining code stays the same
        
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected code snippet adjusts the logic for negative business hours by correctly moving to the previous opening time and obtaining the closing time. This change should fix the bug and allow the function to work properly with negative business hours.
