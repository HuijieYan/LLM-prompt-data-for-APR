## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is designed to adjust a given datetime object based on business hours specified in the class attributes.
2. The function calls several other methods within the same class to determine the next opening time, closing time, and business hours by second.
3. The bug appears to be related to the logic of adjusting the datetime object to the next business day and calculating remaining business hours.
4. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` uses the `CustomBusinessHour` offset with a specific start time and a holiday specified for November 26, 2020. The test expects certain datetime values after adjusting based on the custom business hour offset.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug is likely to be caused by incorrect adjustments in the logic of handling business days and business hours within the `apply` function. This leads to incorrect calculations when adjusting the input datetime object.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
A suggested strategy to fix the bug would involve reviewing the logic for adjusting the datetime object based on business days and remaining business hours. Ensure that the adjustment correctly handles moving to the next business day and calculating the remaining hours within the business time intervals.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            business_hours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + BusinessDay(n=bd) + remain
                else:
                    other = other + BusinessDay(n=bd)

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

                if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    other += bhour
                    if n >= 0:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    else:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By refining the adjustment logic to handle business days and remaining business hours correctly, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
