## Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is not adjusting the datetime properly based on the business hours specified. This is causing the test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` to fail.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect adjustment of the `datetime` object when `n >= 0`.
2. Incorrect handling of business days adjustment.
3. Incorrect calculation of remaining business hours to adjust.
4. Incorrect adjustment of the `datetime` object when `n < 0`.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect logic in adjusting the datetime based on the specified business hours. The existing logic does not handle the edge cases properly, leading to incorrect results.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure proper adjustment of the datetime object when `n >= 0`.
2. Correctly handle the adjustment for business days.
3. Calculate and adjust the remaining business hours accurately.
4. Fix the adjustment of the datetime object when `n < 0`.
5. Verify that the datetime manipulation aligns with the specified business hours.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function in the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            
            adjusted_time = other

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    adjusted_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    adjusted_time = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(adjusted_time):
                    adjusted_time = self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_time)
                    adjusted_time = self._get_closing_time(adjusted_time)

            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            days_to_adjust = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            
            adjusted_time += days_to_adjust

            remaining_minutes = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while remaining_minutes > timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    next_closing_time = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_time))
                    hours_until_closing = next_closing_time - adjusted_time
                    if remaining_minutes < hours_until_closing:
                        adjusted_time += remaining_minutes
                    else:
                        remaining_minutes -= hours_until_closing
                        adjusted_time = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_time + hours_until_closing)
                else:
                    next_opening_time = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_time)
                    hours_until_opening = next_opening_time - adjusted_time
                    if remaining_minutes >= hours_until_opening:
                        adjusted_time += remaining_minutes
                        remaining_minutes = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        adjusted_time = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(adjusted_time + hours_until_opening - timedelta(seconds=1)))
                        remaining_minutes -= hours_until_opening

            return adjusted_time
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With this corrected version, the function should properly adjust the datetime based on the specified business hours, resolving the issue causing the failing test.
