## Analysis:
The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class. This function is responsible for applying the business hour offset to a given datetime object. The bug seems to be related to the calculation and adjustment of the datetime based on the business hours specified.

## Identified Issue:
The issue seems to be with the calculation of business days (`bd`) and remaining business hours (`r`), along with the adjustment of the datetime based on these values. The logic for adjusting the datetime within the while loops appears to be incorrect, leading to incorrect output.

## Bug Cause:
1. Incorrect calculation and adjustment of business days and remaining hours.
2. Incorrect logic within the while loops for adjusting the datetime based on remaining hours.
3. Possible issues with how `bd` and `r` are calculated and adjusted based on the positive or negative values of `n`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Correct the calculation and adjustment logic for `bd` and `r`.
2. Adjust the while loops logic to correctly handle the remaining business hours based on the sign of `n`.
3. Ensure that the adjustment is done accurately within the defined business hours.

## Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
# Assuming the corrected version is within the same class and file

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)

                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd = n // (businesshours // 60)
            r = n % (businesshours // 60)

            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            other += skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain.total_seconds() < 0:
                    bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    if bhour_remain > bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain += bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(other - bhour)
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should address the calculation and adjustment issues within the `apply` function and enable it to pass the failing test provided.
