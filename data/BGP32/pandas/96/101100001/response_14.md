The bug in the `apply` function is caused by the incorrect adjustment of the `other` datetime variable. The logic for adjusting the datetime based on the business hours is flawed and leads to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for adjusting the `other` datetime variable based on the business hours, ensuring that it accurately reflects the intended behavior of the business hour offset.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
        direction = 1 if n >= 0 else -1

        for _ in range(r):
            other = other + pd.offsets.Hour()
            while not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = other + pd.offsets.Hour()

        for _ in range(abs(bd)):
            other = other + skip_bd * direction

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making these adjustments, the `apply` function should now correctly handle the business hour offset and pass the failing test provided.
