## Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is supposed to adjust a given datetime value based on business hour offsets. However, the implementation of the function contains several potential error locations:
1. Handling of negative values for `n` might lead to incorrect adjustments.
2. Calculation of business hours and days needs to be precise to ensure accurate adjustments.
3. Condition checks within the while loops may not cover all edge cases leading to incorrect results.

## Bug Cause:
The buggy function fails the provided test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` due to incorrect adjustment of the datetime values based on business hour offsets. The function doesn't handle negative `n` values properly and lacks precision in calculating the business hours and days, resulting in incorrect output.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `apply` function, we need to ensure precise calculations for adjusting the datetime values based on business hour offsets. Proper handling of negative values for `n` is also crucial. We should review the logic within the function to cover all possible edge cases and ensure accurate adjustments.

## Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Skip timezone and nanosecond adjustments
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, nanosecond=0)
        n = self.n

        # Adjusting the datetime value based on business hour offsets
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Business hours calculation
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        # Business days adjustment
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = self.next_bday(other) if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other) else other
            other += skip_bd

        # Remaining business hours adjustment
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                other += min(bhour_remain, bhour)
                bhour_remain -= min(bhour_remain, bhour)
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                other += min(bhour_remain, bhour, timedelta(seconds=1) if other.nanosecond != 0 else timedelta(0))
                bhour_remain -= min(bhour_remain, bhour)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By applying the corrections mentioned above in the `apply` function, it should now produce the correct results and pass the failing test provided.
