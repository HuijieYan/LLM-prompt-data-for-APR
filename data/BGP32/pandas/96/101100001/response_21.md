### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is a method defined within the `BusinessHourMixin` class.
2. The function is supposed to apply business hour frequency offset to a given datetime object.
3. The bug seems to be related to the calculation logic within the function, which is causing incorrect outputs.
4. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is failing because the output generated by the buggy function does not match the expected output for the given input parameters.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The buggy function is not correctly handling the adjustment of business days and business hours based on the input parameters.
2. The calculations for adjusting the datetime object according to the business hours and days are incorrect, leading to unexpected results.
3. The bug is likely in the logic where the function adjusts the datetime based on the business days and hours.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the logic for handling business days and business hours in the `apply` method to ensure correct adjustment of the datetime object.
2. Make sure to accurately calculate the business hours and days required for the adjustment.
3. Test the function with different input scenarios to verify the correctness of the adjustments.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# Import these symbols before the corrected version of the function
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay

# Corrected version of the buggy function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
        
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
            bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other if n >= 0 else other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
            if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour) if n >= 0 else self._get_closing_time(other - timedelta(seconds=1))
                bhour_remain -= bhour
            else:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying these corrections, the function should now produce the correct output for the given test case and other similar scenarios.
