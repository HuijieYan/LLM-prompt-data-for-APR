## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is a method in the `BusinessHourMixin` class. It takes an argument `other`, checks if it's an instance of `datetime`, and then performs calculations based on the input.
2. The buggy function relies on various other methods within the same class for performing calculations related to business hours and offsets.
3. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is testing the behavior of creating a date range with custom business hours and holidays. The test fails due to the buggy behavior in the `apply` function, causing unexpected results in the date range generation.

## Identified Bug:
The bug in the `apply` function arises from incorrect handling of business hours and offsets when adjusting the input datetime `other`. This leads to incorrect calculations and results, causing the failing test to detect an inconsistency in the generated date range.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments made to the input datetime `other` accurately reflect the business hours and offsets defined in the `BusinessHourMixin` class. Correctly calculating the business day increments and adjusting the remaining business hours is crucial to ensure the expected behavior of the date range generation.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:

```python
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            opening_time = self._next_opening_time(other) if n >= 0 else self._prev_opening_time(other)
    
            businesshours = self._get_business_hours_by_sec(self.start, self.end)
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            other = opening_time + timedelta(days=bd, minutes=r)
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By accurately adjusting the input datetime `other` based on the business hours and offsets, the corrected version of the `apply` function should pass the failing test and produce the expected results in the date range generation.
