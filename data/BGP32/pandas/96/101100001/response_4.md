## Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is a method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. It is supposed to adjust a datetime object based on a custom business hour frequency. The function has a logic error that causes it to not correctly handle the adjustment of datetime objects within the custom business hour.

## Identified Issue:
The main issue in the buggy function is with the logic for adjusting the datetime object for positive and negative business hour offsets. The handling of business days and remaining business hours is incorrect, leading to incorrect adjustments of the datetime object.

## Bug Cause:
The bug causes incorrect adjustments to the datetime object when the business hour frequency is applied. This leads to discrepancies in the resulting datetime object when adjusting by positive or negative business hour offsets.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Correct the logic for adjusting the datetime object based on positive and negative business hour offsets.
2. Ensure proper handling of business days and remaining business hours during the adjustment process.
3. Verify that the adjustments align correctly with the specified custom business hour frequency.

## Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:

```python
# Import statements (if not already present)
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessHour, BusinessDay

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            if isinstance(self, BusinessHour):
                n = self.n

                # Adjust other to remove timezone and nanosecond
                other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, nanosecond=0)

                # Calculate total business hours in one business day
                businesshours = sum(
                    self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                    for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
                )

                bd, r = divmod(abs(n), businesshours)

                if n < 0:
                    bd, r = -bd, -r

                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other_start = other.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)

                if n >= 0:
                    while bd != 0:
                        if self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                            other += skip_bd
                        else:
                            other = other_start
                            bd -= 1

                    while r != 0:
                        next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
                        bhours = next_opening - other
                        if bhours.total_seconds() <= r * 60:
                            other = next_opening
                            r -= bhours.total_seconds() / 60
                        else:
                            other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                            r = 0
                else:
                    while bd != 0:
                        if self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                            other -= skip_bd
                        else:
                            other = other_start
                            bd += 1

                    while r != 0:
                        prev_opening = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                        bhours = other - prev_opening
                        if bhours.total_seconds() <= abs(r) * 60:
                            other = prev_opening
                            r += bhours.total_seconds() / 60
                        else:
                            other -= timedelta(minutes=abs(r))
                            r = 0

                return other

            else:
                raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Applying the corrections above should fix the bug in the `apply` function, allowing it to correctly adjust the datetime object based on the custom business hour frequency.
