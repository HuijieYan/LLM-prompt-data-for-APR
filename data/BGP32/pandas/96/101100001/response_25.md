### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is supposed to adjust a given datetime object based on business hour offsets.
2. The bug seems to be related to incorrect adjustments and calculations within the function.
3. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` aims to verify the behavior of the `apply` function with custom business hours but fails due to incorrect adjustments leading to wrong datetime outputs.
   
### Bug Explanation:
The bug seems to stem from incorrect calculations and adjustments within the `apply` function. The function fails to correctly adjust the given datetime object based on the business hour offsets, leading to incorrect results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Review the logic for adjusting the datetime object based on business hour offsets.
2. Ensure that the calculations for business day adjustments and remaining business hours are correct.
3. Verify the logic for moving to the next or previous opening/closing times is accurate.
4. Consider using debugging and printing statements to track the adjustments and identify any discrepancies.

### Corrected Function:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    if n >= 0:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                    else:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Applying the corrected logic focusing on proper adjustments and offset calculations should fix the bug and allow the failing test to pass.
