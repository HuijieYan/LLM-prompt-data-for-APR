### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is a method within the `BusinessHourMixin` class. It is decorated with `@apply_wraps` which might be used for wrapping functionality.
2. The `apply` function takes another datetime object `other` and applies business hour offsets to it based on the rules defined within the function.
3. The bug might be related to how the function calculates and adjusts business hours for a given datetime object, causing incorrect results.
4. The failing test case is `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` which uses a custom business hour frequency with specific starting time and holidays.

### Bug:
The bug lies in the calculation and adjustment of the business hours in the `apply` function. It seems that the logic to adjust the datetime object based on business hours is incorrect, leading to incorrect results when applying business hour offsets to a datetime object.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Correct the logic for adjusting the datetime object based on positive and negative business hours.
2. Ensure proper handling of business day skips and remaining business hours adjustments.
3. Verify the conditions for moving to the next business time interval are accurate.
4. Update the logic to properly adjust the datetime object based on the business hour offsets.

### Corrected Function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=n)

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            while n != 0:
                if n > 0:
                    other = other + skip_bd
                    n = n - 1
                else:
                    other = other - skip_bd
                    n = n + 1

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Applying this correction should address the bug within the `apply` function and ensure that the business hour offsets are correctly applied to the datetime object passed to it.
