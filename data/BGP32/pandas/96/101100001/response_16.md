### Analysis:
- The buggy function `apply(self, other)` is failing to correctly adjust the datetime based on the custom business hours set in the `CustomBusinessHour` offset.
- The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is designed to check if the custom business hours are correctly applied when generating a date range.

### Error Location:
- The issue seems to be related to the calculation of business days and business hours within the `apply` function for the `CustomBusinessHour` offset.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by incorrect adjustments made to the input datetime `other` within the `apply` function. The logic for adjusting to the next opening time, closing time, and handling business days is not implemented correctly, leading to incorrect output.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Revise the logic for adjusting the datetime `other` to correctly handle the custom business hours according to the specified offset.
- Ensure that the adjustments for business days and business hours align with the expected behavior of the `CustomBusinessHour` offset.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                if n >= 0:
                    if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    other += BusinessDay(n=bd)
                else:
                    if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                    other -= BusinessDay(n=-bd)
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        break
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self.next_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1)
                else:
                    bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    if bhour_remain < bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and other.nanosecond != 0):
                        other -= bhour_remain
                        break
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self.prev_opening_time(other, offset=-1)
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By updating the `apply` function with the corrected logic for adjusting the datetime based on the custom business hours, the function should now pass the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.
