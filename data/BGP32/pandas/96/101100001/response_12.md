## Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class.
2. The function is trying to adjust a datetime object based on business hour offsets and other conditions.
3. The test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is failing when using a custom business hour offset with specific start time and holidays.
4. The bug seems to be related to how the adjustment for business hours is calculated and applied.

## Bug Cause:
The bug seems to be related to the adjustment of business hours and handling of business day offsets in the `apply` function. The logic for adjusting the datetime object based on business hours and days is incorrect, leading to unexpected results.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Review the logic for adjusting business hours and days in the `apply` function.
2. Ensure that the adjustments are correctly calculated and applied based on the business hour offsets.
3. Verify the handling of business day offsets and adjustments within the function.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    # Fixed version of the buggy function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                original_time = other.time()
                original_day = other.date()

                if original_time not in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)

                while n > 0:
                    other += timedelta(days=1)
                    if other.weekday() < 5 and self._is_on_offset(other):
                        n -= 1

                new_time = other.time()
                other = datetime(
                    year=original_day.year,
                    month=original_day.month,
                    day=original_day.day,
                    hour=new_time.hour,
                    minute=new_time.minute,
                    second=new_time.second,
                    microsecond=new_time.microsecond,
                )

            else:
                original_time = other.time()
                original_day = other.date()

                if original_time in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)

                if self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)

                while n < 0:
                    other -= timedelta(days=1)
                    if other.weekday() < 5 and self._is_on_offset(other):
                        n += 1

                new_time = other.time()
                other = datetime(
                    year=original_day.year,
                    month=original_day.month,
                    day=original_day.day,
                    hour=new_time.hour,
                    minute=new_time.minute,
                    second=new_time.second,
                    microsecond=new_time.microsecond,
                )

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the logic for adjusting business hours and days within the `apply` function, the corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing test.
