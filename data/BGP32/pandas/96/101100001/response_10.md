### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is supposed to adjust a datetime object based on the business hours defined by the `BusinessHourMixin` class.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the adjustment of the datetime object is handled within the function.
3. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` shows that the adjusted datetimes are not matching the expected values due to the bug.
4. The bug causes the adjustment of the datetime to be incorrect when dealing with negative business hours.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. The bug seems to be related to how the adjustment is applied based on the business hours and the provided datetime.
2. The correction should focus on correctly handling the adjustment logic for both positive and negative business hours.
3. Ensure that the adjustments are made by considering the opening and closing times of the business hours.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from datetime import timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            if n >= 0:
                start_time = self.start[0]
                if other.time() >= self.end[-1] or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjust to the previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(days=1)

            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

            business_minutes = abs(n) * 60
            
            bd, r = divmod(business_minutes, business_hours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
            
            if r != 0:
                if n >= 0:
                    while r > 0:
                        bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                        if r >= bhour.seconds // 60:
                            other += bhour
                            r -= bhour.seconds // 60
                        else:
                            other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                            r = 0
                else:
                    while r < 0:
                        bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                        if r <= bhour.seconds // 60:
                            other += bhour
                            r -= bhour.seconds // 60
                        else:
                            other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                            r = 0

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should address the bug in the `apply` function and make the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` pass successfully.
