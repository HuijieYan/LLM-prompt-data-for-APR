## Analysis:
- The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is supposed to adjust a datetime object based on business hours and offsets.
- The function contains logic to handle positive and negative adjustments based on the time provided.
- The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` tries to create a date range with custom business hours and expects specific datetime values as the result.
- The bug seems to be related to the adjustment of the datetime object based on business hours.

## Bug:
The bug seems to be related to the calculation and adjustment of the datetime object within the `apply` function. It fails to correctly adjust the datetime based on the provided business hours and offsets.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
- The bug could be related to the calculation of business hours and offsets.
- Ensure that the adjustment of the datetime object is done correctly based on positive and negative adjustments.
- Check the logic for handling datetime adjustments within business hours carefully.

## Fixed Version of the buggy function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            business_hours_per_day = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            business_days, remaining_minutes = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours_per_day // 60)
            if n < 0:
                business_days, remaining_minutes = -business_days, -remaining_minutes

            if business_days != 0:
                business_day_offset = BusinessDay(n=business_days)
                other = other + business_day_offset

            remaining_timedelta = timedelta(minutes=remaining_minutes)

            while remaining_timedelta != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    closing_time = self._get_closing_time(other)
                    closing_time_prev_opening = self._prev_opening_time(closing_time)
                    if remaining_timedelta < closing_time - other:
                        other = other + remaining_timedelta
                        remaining_timedelta = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        remaining_timedelta -= closing_time - other
                        other = self._next_opening_time(closing_time_prev_opening)
                else:
                    next_opening_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    if remaining_timedelta > next_opening_time - other:
                        other = other + remaining_timedelta
                        remaining_timedelta = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        remaining_timedelta -= next_opening_time - other
                        other = self._get_closing_time(next_opening_time - timedelta(seconds=1)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

```

With this correction, the `apply` function should now correctly adjust the datetime object based on the provided business hours and offsets. This fixed version should now pass the failing test provided.
