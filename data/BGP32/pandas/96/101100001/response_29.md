### Analysis:
1. The function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is using the `apply_wraps` decorator, which suggests that it is expected to have some additional functionality or wrapping applied to it.
2. The function takes a `datetime` object as input and performs calculations based on business hours, adjusting the input datetime accordingly.
3. The failing test involves creating a `CustomBusinessHour` offset and using it in a `pd.date_range` call, where the expected output includes specific datetime values adjusted by business hours.

### Bug:
The bug in the `apply` function arises from the logic used to adjust the input datetime based on business hours. The calculation for adjusting business hours and moving to the next opening time is causing incorrect outputs.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Identify the issue with the adjustment logic in handling positive and negative offsets.
2. Make sure the adjustment process correctly handles the case where the input time falls on the opening time.
3. Review the logic for adjusting business hours to ensure correctness.
4. Update the adjustment process to match the desired behavior based on the failing test.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay
from datetime import timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin():
    
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            # Save input time
            orig_time = other.time()
    
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if orig_time in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if orig_time in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # Correct for business days
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = other + skip_bd
    
            # adjusting minutes for business hours
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other) + bhour
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour - bhour_remain) < timedelta(seconds=1):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the adjustment logic and ensuring that the adjustments are aligned with the expected behavior, the `apply` function should now produce the correct output for the given test case.
