## Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is failing to adjust the datetime based on the custom business hours specified. The function attempts to adjust the given datetime according to the specified business hours, but it fails to do so correctly, leading to incorrect results. This bug is causing the test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` to fail.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Calculation of business hours in one business day.
2. Adjustment of datetime based on business days and business hours.
3. Handling of different scenarios when adjusting the datetime.

## Bug Cause:
The bug seems to be related to the incorrect adjustment of the datetime in the `apply` function based on the custom business hours. The calculation of business hours per day and the adjustment process for business days and remaining business hours are not correctly implemented. This is leading to the datetime being adjusted incorrectly, causing the failing test.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure correct calculation of total business hours in one business day.
2. Implement accurate adjustment of the datetime based on business days and remaining business hours.
3. Verify the logic for moving to the next business time interval and adjusting the datetime accordingly.
4. Check and correct the handling of different scenarios during the adjustment process.

## Corrected Version:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
        
            n = self.n
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
        
            # adjust by business days first
            other = self._next_opening_time(other) if n >= 0 and (other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other)) else other
            other = other - timedelta(seconds=1) if n < 0 and other.time() in self.start else other

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                curr_date = other.date()                
                while bd != 0:
                    if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        if n >= 0 or (curr_date.weekday() == 6 and curr_date + timedelta(days=1) not in self.holidays):
                            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                        else:
                            other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    other += skip_bd
                    bd -= 1
            
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other if n >= 0 else self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other) if n >= 0 else self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected version of the `apply` function addresses the issues related to the incorrect adjustment of the datetime based on the custom business hours. It ensures the correct calculation of business hours per day and accurately adjusts the datetime considering business days and remaining business hours. This corrected version should pass the failing test now.
