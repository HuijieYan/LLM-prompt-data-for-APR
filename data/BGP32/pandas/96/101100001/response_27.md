## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class which extends the `BusinessMixin` class.
2. The function is designed to adjust a datetime object based on business hour offsets.
3. The bug is likely related to the calculation of the adjusted datetime within business hours.
4. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` uses a custom business hour frequency and expects specific datetime values in the result.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug is likely related to the calculation of adjusted datetime within business hours. The function `apply` tries to adjust the datetime based on business days and remaining business hours, but there may be issues in the logic leading to incorrect results.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Check the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours.
2. Ensure that the adjustments are correctly calculated based on the provided business hour offsets.
3. Pay attention to edge cases where the adjustments may not align with the expected business hours.

## Corrected Version of the `apply` function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
            
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday().is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = (self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other)
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the logic in the adjustment of business days and remaining business hours, the fixed version of the `apply` function should now pass the failing test.
