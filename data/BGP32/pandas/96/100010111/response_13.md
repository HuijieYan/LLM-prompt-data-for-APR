### Bug Analysis
- The buggy function is the `apply` function from the `pandas.tseries.offsets` module.
- The error message indicates that there is a `ValueError` raised during the frequency validation process.
- The function seems to be associating business hours with a datetime object to handle cases within the working hours.
- The cause of the bug seems to be related to the way the `other` datetime object is manipulated within the function.
- The bug might be leading to incorrect results when determining business hours in certain cases.
- The function should be modified to correctly handle all edge conditions and adjust the datetime object within the required business constraints.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that the business hours are calculated correctly by accounting for all edge cases.
2. Properly adjust the `other` datetime object based on the business rules specified by the offset.
3. Verify that the adjustments for business days and remaining business hours are correctly calculated.
4. Make sure that the frequency validation process in the calling function is successful without raising any errors.

### Corrected Function
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if not hasattr(other, 'nanosecond'):
            other = other.replace(nanosecond=0)
        n = self.n

        # adjust other based on business rules
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # calculate total business hours
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and getattr(other, 'nanosecond', 0) != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(
                        self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))
                    )

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected function ensures that the adjustments and calculations for business hours are done correctly according to the given offset rules. It should resolve the issue with the date_range function when using CustomBusinessHour with holidays.
