### Analysis:
- The `apply` function is designed to work with business hours and adjust datetime values based on certain conditions.
- The error message occurs in another function (`_validate_frequency`) which is indirectly impacted by the buggy `apply` function.
- The error message (`ValueError: Inferred frequency None from passed values does not conform to passed frequency CBH`) suggests that the frequency inference failed for the given date range and custom business hour.
- The provided test cases specify the input parameters and the expected output values for the `apply` function to pass successfully.

### Error Location:
- The error might be happening due to the improper handling of business hours, calculations, and adjustments in the `apply` function.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by improper handling of business day calculations within the `apply` function, resulting in incorrect adjustments leading to the frequency validation failure in the `_validate_frequency` function.

### Fix Strategy:
- Review the business day calculations, adjustments, and time intervals in the `apply` function.
- Ensure that the adjustments align with the business hour constraints and avoid cases where the frequency inference might fail.
- Update the calculations and adjustments to correctly adjust the input datetime values based on the specified business hours.

### Correction:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessDay

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() not in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        business_hours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

By modifying the logic for adjusting datetime values based on business hours within the `apply` function, the corrected version should address the issue, pass the failing test cases, and align with the expected input/output values and the GitHub issue description.
