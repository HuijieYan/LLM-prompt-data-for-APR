### Analysis
The buggy function is meant to apply a CustomBusinessHour offset to a given datetime. The function is intended to adjust the datetime to fit the business hours specified in the CustomBusinessHour object.

The error message suggests a problem with the frequency validation when using periods and holidays in the `pd.date_range` function. This error likely arises from the incorrect behavior of the function `apply(self, other)` when adjusting the datetime based on the specified offset.

### Bug Explanation
The bug likely occurs due to incorrect adjustments of the input datetime in the `apply` function. This leads to the adjusted datetime not aligning properly with the business hours specified in the CustomBusinessHour object, causing issues during frequency validation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To resolve the bug, we need to carefully adjust the input datetime according to the CustomBusinessHour offset, ensuring that it aligns with the specified business hours. This alignment will help the `pd.date_range` function work correctly when using periods and holidays.

### Bug-fixed Function
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        adjusted = other

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() not in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                adjusted = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                adjusted = other - timedelta(seconds=1)

            if not self._is_on_offset(adjusted):
                adjusted = self._next_opening_time(adjusted)
                adjusted = self._get_closing_time(adjusted)

        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)

        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.start[0] <= self.next_bday.apply(other) < self.end[0]:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd - 1)

            adjusted = self.next_bday.apply(other)
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
                business_hour = timedelta(hours=1)

                if n < 0:
                    if business_hour <= bhour_remain:
                        adjusted += business_hour
                        bhour_remain -= business_hour
                    else:
                        break
                else:
                    adjusted += business_hour
                    bhour_remain -= business_hour

        return adjusted
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version ensures that the datetime adjustment aligns properly with the specified business hours, allowing the frequency validation to work correctly in scenarios involving periods and holidays in `pd.date_range`.
