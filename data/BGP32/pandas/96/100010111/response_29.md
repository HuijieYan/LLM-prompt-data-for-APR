### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `CustomBusinessHour` class and is intended to adjust a given datetime based on a custom business hour offset. The error message is raised when validating the frequency compatibility in the `CustomBusinessHour` class, specifically in the `_validate_frequency` method.
   
2. The bug occurs when using `pd.date_range` with periods and a custom business hour frequency with holidays. The function fails to handle holidays correctly, resulting in an incorrect number of periods in the date range.

### Issues in the Buggy Function:
1. The function does not account for holidays when adjusting the datetime based on the business hours.
2. The logic to handle holidays is missing, leading to a discrepancy in the number of periods generated with holidays.
3. The error arises when comparing the inferred frequency to the provided frequency and raising a `ValueError`.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug:
1. Include holiday handling logic to adjust the datetime correctly based on the specified business hours.
2. Ensure that holidays are correctly considered when determining the number of periods in the date range with a custom business hour frequency.
3. Implement proper error handling and comparisons to avoid the `ValueError` when validating frequencies.

### Updated Corrected Function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.holiday import USFederalHolidayCalendar

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            bday_cal = USFederalHolidayCalendar()
            holidays = bday_cal.holidays(
                start=other - timedelta(days=1), end=other + timedelta(days=1)
            )

            while skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                other += timedelta(days=1 if n > 0 else -1)
                if other.date() in holidays:
                    continue

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected function includes logic to handle holidays correctly while adjusting the datetime based on the custom business hour offset. By adjusting the holiday handling and period calculations, the function should now generate the correct number of periods in a date range with a custom business hour frequency and holidays.
