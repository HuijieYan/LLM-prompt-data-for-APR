### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is designed to adjust a given `datetime` based on a business hour `self` and some conditions related to business days and business hours. The error message indicates a `ValueError` raised during a test involving a frequency validation check for a `DatetimeArray`, which indicates possible discrepancies in the frequency inferred from passed values and the given frequency.

### Bug Location:
The bug seems to be occurring in the `apply` method when handling adjustments for business days and business hours, leading to invalid datetime arithmetic and frequency mismatches.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug might be altering the datetime `other` in an inappropriate way, leading to offsets that don't conform to the expected frequency. This incorrect manipulation cascades into the `DateRange` generation, causing a frequency validation failure and triggering the `ValueError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to carefully adjust `other` based on the business day and business hour rules while ensuring that the datetime attributes align with the expected frequency. Properly handling the adjustments for business days and hours should lead to a valid frequency when generating the `DateRange`.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` method:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), 120)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other if n >= 0 else self._next_opening_time(other) - other
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = other + bhour

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version adjusts the business hour calculations more accurately to maintain the expected frequency when generating a `DateRange`.
