### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is supposed to adjust a given datetime based on a CustomBusinessHour offset. The function is incorrectly calculating and adjusting the datetime, leading to unexpected behavior when holidays are involved in the calculations. This bug causes the date_range function to produce an incorrect number of periods when combining CustomBusinessHour with holidays.

### Error Location:
The issue lies in how the adjustments are made based on the business days and remaining business hours. Incorrect calculations inside the while loops are causing the function to deviate from the expected behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function fails to adjust the datetime properly when dealing with negative business days and remaining hours. This leads to an incorrect calculation in the presence of holidays, resulting in an unexpected number of periods in the date_range function.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure accurate adjustment of business days based on positive and negative offsets.
2. Correctly calculate the remaining business hours and adjust them without introducing further errors.
3. Modify condition checks inside the while loops to handle business hours accurately.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

        base_dt = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other) + self.delta

        business_hours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(start, end)
            for start, end in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.onOffset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
        else:
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() < 0:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain <= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Summary:
The corrected function adjusts the datetime properly considering positive and negative business days and remaining business hours accurately. This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug by ensuring the correct behavior of the `date_range` function in the presence of holidays.
