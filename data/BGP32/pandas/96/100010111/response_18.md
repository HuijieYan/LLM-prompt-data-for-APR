### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is trying to adjust datetime objects based on business hours by seconds in a business day.
2. The error occurs when using the `pd.date_range` method with periods and adding holidays, resulting in more periods than expected due to the incorrect adjustment of business hours.
3. The bug causes unexpected datetime outputs due to incorrect adjustments based on holidays and business hours within the buggy function `apply`.
4. The strategy for fixing the bug involves correcting the logic within the `apply` function to correctly adjust datetime objects based on business hours and holidays.
5. Review and update the logic within the `apply` function to properly handle business hours and holiday adjustments.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from pandas import Timestamp, Timedelta
from pandas.tseries.offsets import ApplyTypeError

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, Timestamp):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        other = Timestamp(
            year=other.year,
            month=other.month,
            day=other.day,
            hour=other.hour,
            minute=other.minute,
            second=other.second,
            microsecond=other.microsecond,
        )

        # adjust other based on business hours and holidays
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= Timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)

        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = Timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != Timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

            if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                other += bhour
                bhour_remain = Timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Now, the corrected version of the `apply` function should properly adjust datetime objects based on business hours and holidays, fixing the issue encountered when using `pd.date_range` with periods and adding holidays.
