### Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is designed to combine business hours with datetime objects, but it is causing an issue in the `pandas.date_range` function when adding holidays. This issue can be traced back to the incorrect adjustment of dates within the `apply` function.

### Error Cause
The bug arises from improper date adjustments in the `apply` function causing unexpected behavior when generating date ranges with holidays in `pandas.date_range`. The incorrect adjustments lead to inaccurate holiday handling, which results in unexpected periods in the output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the date adjustments in the `apply` function. Ensure that the adjustment of the datetime objects within the function does not introduce inconsistencies that may affect the behavior of the `pandas.date_range` function with holidays.

### Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = self.next_bday.rollforward(other)
            other = other + skip_bd
        
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        
        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other - timedelta(seconds=1)))
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version addresses the issues with date adjustments in the `apply` function, ensuring correct behavior when generating date ranges with holidays in `pandas.date_range`.
