### Bug Analysis
- The bug lies in the `apply` function within the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
- The bug occurs when trying to apply a custom business hour frequency with holidays specified, resulting in an incorrect calculation of periods during the `date_range` function call.
- The error message indicates a failed validation of the frequency due to a mismatch between inferred frequency and the provided frequency (CBH).
- The bug leads to an incorrect generation of dates in the `date_range` function when using periods with a custom business hour frequency and holidays.
- The failing test confirms this issue as it includes the same scenario described in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Fixing Strategy
- To fix this bug, the `apply` function should be adjusted to properly handle the calculation of business days, hours, and holidays in order to generate correct date ranges.
- The logic involving holiday handling and business day adjustment should be thoroughly reviewed and corrected to ensure accurate date generation.
- Ensure that the frequency validation step is accurately performed to avoid the mismatch issue between the inferred frequency and the provided frequency.

### Bug-fixed Function
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if self.holidays:
            other = self.next_bday._adjust_to_bday(other, self.holidays)
        n = self.n
        business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd, weekmask=self.weekmask, holidays=self.holidays)
            other = self.next_bday._adjust_to_bday(other, self.holidays)
            other = other + skip_bd
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if bhour_remain > bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Conclusion
The bug has been fixed in the `apply` function by accurately adjusting business days, hours, and holidays while generating date ranges with custom business hour frequencies. The corrected function should now properly handle the scenario described in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
