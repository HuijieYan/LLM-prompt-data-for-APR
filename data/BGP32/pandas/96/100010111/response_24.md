### Analyzing the bug

The buggy function `apply` is related to custom business hours within the pandas library. The error message is thrown during a test case involving the creation of a date range with custom business hours and holidays, but the number of resulting periods is incorrect. This issue is consistent with the GitHub issue reported regarding `pd.date_range` behavior.

### Identifying potential error locations

The function `apply` contains multiple operations related to adjusting datetime values based on business hours and holidays. It calculates business hours, adjusts for holidays, business days, and remaining hours. The error might be related to improper handling of holidays within the business hour calculation or adjustment process.

### Explaining the bug

The bug likely occurs due to the improper handling of holidays in the business hour adjustment process. When adjusting datetime values with custom business hours and holidays, the function fails to correctly account for holidays, leading to an incorrect calculation of business hour intervals.

### Suggested bug-fixing strategy

To fix the bug, we should ensure that holidays are properly considered when adjusting the datetime values based on custom business hours. The logic for adjusting business days, hours, and remaining time periods should account for holidays to provide the correct output in the date range.

### Corrected function

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        self._create_offsets()

        adjusted = self.rollforward(other)
        if n < 0:
            n = -n
            adjusted = self.rollback(adjusted)

        current_holiday = pd.Timestamp(adjusted).normalize()
        while n > 0:
            if current_holiday in self.holidays:
                adjusted += self._offset
                current_holiday = pd.Timestamp(adjusted).normalize()
            else:
                adjusted += self._offset
                n -= 1

        return adjusted
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version considers holidays when adjusting datetime values based on custom business hours, ensuring the correct behavior.

By applying this fix, the `apply` function should address the issue mentioned in the failing test and align with the expectations provided through various test cases.
