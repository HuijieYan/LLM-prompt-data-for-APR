### An Issue in the Buggy Code
The issue in the buggy function arises from the `apply` function in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file. The function fails when attempting to adjust business hours for timestamps that include holidays, leading to unexpected results in generating DatetimeIndex objects.

### The Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of time adjustments when a holiday is present. This results in the timestamp being inaccurate, creating more business day periods than expected.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To address this issue, the bug needs to be fixed in the `apply` function, particularly the segment that deals with handling holidays. By adjusting the logic to correctly consider holidays within the business hour calculations, the function can return the expected DatetimeIndex objects.

### The Corrected Function

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                other = skip_bd.onOffset(other)

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
            bhour = self._get_next_business_hour(other, n)
            if bhour_remain > bhour:
                other += bhour
                bhour_remain -= bhour
            else:
                other += bhour_remain
                break

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected function addresses the holiday handling issue, ensuring that the business hours are adjusted correctly based on the specified CustomBusinessHour parameters.
