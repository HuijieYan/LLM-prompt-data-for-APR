### Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is designed to handle business hours adjustments for datetime objects, particularly for custom business hours specified in the `CustomBusinessHour` class. The error message indicates a ValueError raised during a validation check within the `CustomBusinessHour._validate_frequency` function.

The bug affects how the function handles holidays in custom business hours, leading to unexpected behavior in the `date_range` function when holidays are specified.

### Error Identification
The bug arises from how the custom business hours are adjusted when there is a holiday within the specified range. This leads to incorrect calculation of periods in the `date_range` function due to the faulty business hours adjustment.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug stems from the mishandling of holidays within the `CustomBusinessHour` class. When adjusting for business hours, the function does not appropriately consider holidays, leading to an error in calculating the correct periods.

### Proposed Fix
To fix the bug, the `apply` function should be updated to correctly adjust for holidays within the specified business hours. The function should ensure that the adjustment logic considers holidays to calculate the correct periods in the `date_range` function.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
import pandas as pd

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Adjust per business hours
        adjusted_datetime = other
        if self.on_offset(other):
            return adjusted_datetime

        # Handle holidays
        if self.holidays and adjusted_datetime in self.holidays:
            adjusted_datetime += pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour()

        # Shift to nearest business hour
        if self.start > self.end:
            delta = -1
        else:
            delta = 1

        while not self.on_offset(adjusted_datetime):
            adjusted_datetime += delta * pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour()

        return adjusted_datetime
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected function accounts for holidays and adjusts the datetime according to the specified business hours. It ensures that the `date_range` function calculates the correct periods even when holidays are included.
