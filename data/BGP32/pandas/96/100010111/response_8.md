### Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is meant to adjust a given datetime based on custom business hours, business days, and holidays. The function seems to be causing issues when working with a specific frequency, leading to unexpected behavior. The provided error message indicates a `ValueError` raised during frequency validation.

Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The adjustment of `other` based on business days and business hours seems to be incorrect.
2. The calculation of `bd` and `r` may lead to unexpected results.
3. The adjustment of `bhour_remain` seems to be problematic in both positive and negative `n` cases.

Cause of the bug:
The bug in the `apply` function is directly related to the incorrect adjustment of the datetime instance `other` based on the custom business hour specified. This results in incorrect calculations and addition/subtraction of timedelta values, leading to unexpected frequencies and behavior.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Review the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business days and hours.
2. Verify the calculations for `bd`, `r`, and adjustments to `bhour_remain`.
3. Ensure that the adjustments are correctly applied according to the specified business hours.

### Corrected Function
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        holiday_dates = [date.fromisoformat(str(h)) for h in self.holidays]

        adjusted_value = other

        while n != 0:
            adj_day = adjusted_value.date()

            while bool(n > 0) == (adj_day.weekday() >= 5 or adj_day in holiday_dates):
                adj_day += timedelta(days=1)
            
            adjusted_value = datetime.combine(adj_day, self.start[0])

            if adjusted_value < other:
                direction = 1
            elif adjusted_value > other:
                direction = -1
            else:
                break

            while True:
                if n == 0:
                    break

                closed = adjusted_value + timedelta(hours=2) if adjusted_value.time() == self.start[0] else adjusted_value.replace(hour=0)

                steps = int(n / abs(n))  # Either +1 or -1
                if direction == steps:
                    adjusted_value = closed
                else:
                    adjusted_value += timedelta(hours=2)

                n -= steps

        return adjusted_value
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected function includes a revised approach to adjusting the datetime based on business hours, holidays, and business days, ensuring that the calculated frequencies are correct. This should resolve the issue and pass the failing test cases.
