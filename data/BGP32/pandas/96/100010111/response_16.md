### Analysis
1. The buggy function `apply` is related to the failing test that uses `pd.date_range` with a custom business hour offset.
2. The function tries to adjust a given datetime object based on a business hour offset, but it has issues when handling business days and hours.
3. The error message indicates a `ValueError` is raised during frequency validation due to a mismatch in inferred and passed frequencies.
4. The bug likely occurs in the calculation of business hours and adjustment of datetime objects within the function.
5. The function needs to be fixed to correctly adjust the datetime based on the provided business hour offset.

### Bug Cause
- The bug occurs due to incorrect adjustments made in the function when handling business days and hours. It leads to incorrect datetime adjustments, causing a mismatch in frequencies during validation.
- The error message highlights the issue where the inferred frequency does not match the passed frequency.

### Fixing Strategy
- Ensure proper adjustment of the given datetime for the business hour offset.
- Correctly handle business days and remaining business hours for adjustments.
- Verify that the adjustments align with the provided business hour offset.

### Corrected Function
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if self._is_on_offset(other):
            return other
        
        adjusted = other.replace(
            hour=self.start[0].hour,
            minute=self.start[0].minute,
            second=0,
            microsecond=0
        )
        
        if self.n >= 0:
            adjusted = self._next_opening_time(adjusted)
        else:
            if adjusted.time() in self.start:
                adjusted -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            adjusted = self._next_closing_time(adjusted)
        
        hours_diff = self._get_business_hours(adjusted, other)
        new_dt = adjusted
        
        if self.n >= 0:
            delta = timedelta(minutes=hours_diff * 60)
            while delta > timedelta(0):
                new_dt = self._next_opening_time(new_dt + delta)
                delta -= self._get_business_hours(new_dt, new_dt + delta)
        else:
            delta = timedelta(minutes=-hours_diff * 60)
            while delta < timedelta(0):
                new_dt = self._prev_opening_time(new_dt + delta)
                delta += self._get_business_hours(new_dt, new_dt + delta)
        
        return new_dt
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected function aims to properly adjust the given datetime based on the provided business hour offset and should resolve the issue with the failing test.
