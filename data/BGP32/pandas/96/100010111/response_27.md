### Analysis:
1. The buggy function, `apply`, is supposed to adjust datetime objects based on a business hour offset. The function tries to adjust the given datetime object according to the specified business hour offset, skipping holidays and weekends.
   
2. The error message from the failing test occurs in the `_validate_frequency` method, showing a `ValueError`. It indicates that the inferred frequency from the input values does not conform to the provided frequency, in this case, CustomBusinessHour.

3. The cause of the bug seems to be related to how the function processes the datetime objects and adjusts them within the business hour constraints, potentially leading to deviations in the frequency validation process.
   
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments made to the input datetime object align with the specified business hours and do not introduce additional deviations in the frequency validation. Furthermore, the logic for adjusting the datetime objects based on the offset needs to be carefully reviewed to prevent unintended effects.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Refactor the logic for adjusting the datetime object within the business hours, considering weekends, holidays, and the specified business hour offset.
2. Verify the adjustments made to datetime objects to conform to the behavior expected by the CustomBusinessHour offset.
3. Ensure that the logic for adjusting the datetime object handles edge cases accurately without affecting the frequency validation process.
4. Check the business day calculations and adjustments to prevent unexpected behaviors.
5. Avoid any unnecessary conversions or modifications to the datetime object that might lead to the observed frequency validation issues.

### Bug-fixed function:
```python
from pandas.tseries.frequencies import CustomBusinessHour
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay
from datetime import time, datetime, timedelta, date

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        n = self.n
        
        # adjust other to reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        
        # adjust other to align with specified business hours
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() >= self.end[0] or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() < self.start[0]:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        
        # get total business hours for one business day
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        
        # calculate business day and remaining hours
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd
        
        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        
        # adjust the datetime object based on remaining hours
        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            next_opening_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
            bhour = next_opening_time - other if n >= 0 else other - next_opening_time
            if n >= 0 or (n < 0 and bhour_remain >= bhour):
                other = next_opening_time
                bhour_remain -= bhour
            else:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By modifying the adjustment logic for datetime objects within the business hour offset and handling edge cases more precisely, the bug in the `apply` function should be resolved.
