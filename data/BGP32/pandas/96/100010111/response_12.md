## Analysis
The buggy function `apply` in the `offsets.py` file is intended to handle adjustments based on business hours. However, the bug involves the function failing to properly process the passed frequency parameters, leading to a ValueError during validation. The issue is apparent when using `CustomBusinessHour` with holidays, causing the validation to fail and raise an error.

The main problem is likely related to the holiday handling in the function. The error message indicates that the frequencies do not conform due to the inferred frequency being `None`, which does not match the expected frequency, which should be `CBH`. This discrepancy leads to the raised ValueError.

To resolve this bug, the function should be modified to handle holidays and frequencies correctly, ensuring that the validation process compares the expected and inferred frequencies appropriately and does not raise an error.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check the logic for handling holidays and frequencies.
2. Ensure that the function properly accounts for holidays and does not interfere with the frequency validation.
3. Compare the inferred and expected frequencies accurately.
4. Update the function to resolve the issue raised in the GitHub report.

## Bug Fix: Corrected Version of the `apply` Function

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        
        if n > 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        businesshours_sec = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours_sec // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd
        
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        
        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

```

This corrected version of the `apply` function should address the issue raised in the failing test related to holiday handling and frequency validation. Please integrate this fixed function into the `offsets.py` file to resolve the bug.
