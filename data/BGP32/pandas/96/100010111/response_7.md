### Analysis
- The buggy function `apply` is designed to adjust a given timestamp based on business hours.
- The error message indicates a `ValueError` related to the frequency validation.
- The expected input parameters and output values are specified in the test cases.
- The GitHub issue describes a problem related to using periods with holiday addition in `date_range`.

### Bug Cause
- The bug is likely caused by incorrect adjustment of business hours based on holidays, leading to unexpected results in `date_range`.
- The frequency validation issue arises due to a discrepancy between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency.
- The buggy function does not handle holidays correctly, causing periods to exceed the expected value.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Update the `apply` function to properly adjust business hours considering holidays.
2. Ensure that the adjusted timestamp aligns with the business hours after adding holidays.
3. Handle cases where the inferred frequency does not match the expected frequency during validation.
4. Verify that the adjusted timestamps align with the specified business hours.

### Corrected Function
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, pd.Timestamp):
        n = self.n
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        # Adjust for holidays
        if self.holidays and other.normalize() in self.holidays:
            adj = pd.DateOffset(0)
        else:
            adj = self

        adjusted = other + adj
        bhours, remain = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        bhour_remain = pd.Timedelta(minutes=remain)
        
        if n < 0:
            bhours, bhour_remain = -bhours, -bhour_remain

        adjusted = adjusted + pd.DateOffset(days=bhours)
        while bhour_remain > pd.Timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(adjusted)) - adjusted
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(adjusted) - adjusted

            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                adjusted += bhour_remain
                break
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                if n >= 0:
                    adjusted = self._next_opening_time(adjusted + bhour)
                else:
                    adjusted = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(adjusted + bhour - pd.Timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return adjusted
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function should address the bug and ensure proper alignment with the business hours, especially when holidays are involved.
