### Analysis:
- The buggy function, `apply(self, other)`, is designed to adjust a timestamp based on business hours defined by a CustomBusinessHour object.
- The function seems to have a logic error where it considers the next business day incorrectly causing issues with date_range validation.
- The function should correctly adjust the provided timestamp based on the given business hours to ensure proper date_range generation.
- The bug causes date_range to produce incorrect results when using periods along with adding holidays to the CustomBusinessHour.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs when the function incorrectly handles the adjustment of the timestamp for the next opening time and closing time based on business hours.
- This incorrect adjustment causes irregularities in the date_range generation, leading to unexpected outputs.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- The function should ensure proper handling of adjusting the timestamp based on business hours, considering both positive and negative business hour adjustments correctly.
- Adjustments for the opening and closing times within a business day should be consistent to provide accurate results.

### Fixing the Bug:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import ApplyTypeError
from pandas.tseries.frequencies import DateOffset

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        adjusted = other
        for _ in range(abs(n)):
            adjusted += self._adjust(adjusted, n)

        return adjusted
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

DateOffset.apply = apply
```

By updating the apply function and ensuring correct handling of adjustments based on business hours, the date_range generation with CustomBusinessHour and holidays should work as expected.
