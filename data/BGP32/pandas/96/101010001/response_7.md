### Analysis:
1. The error occurs during frequency validation in the `apply` function, which is used to adjust a datetime object based on business hours.
2. The error message indicates that the inferred frequency is `None`, which does not conform to the passed frequency `CBH` (Custom Business Hour).
3. The `apply` function is trying to handle business hours adjustment, which involves time calculations based on business hours. However, it seems to be missing the correct handling of frequency information.
4. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of inferred frequency with the passed frequency.
  
### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the frequency validation in the `apply` function to correctly handle the inferred frequency and passed frequency.
2. Ensure that the frequency information is correctly processed and compared to avoid the ValueError during validation.
3. Verify that the frequency objects are correctly defined and used in the adjustments.
