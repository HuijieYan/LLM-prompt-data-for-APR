### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is supposed to apply a business offset to a datetime object, but the error message is related to frequency validation for a `CustomBusinessHour`. The error occurs when `pd.date_range` is called with a custom business hour frequency.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of frequency validation for the custom business hour.
2. Potential issue with the way the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency is handled within the `apply` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the frequency validation to fail when using a custom business hour frequency, leading to a `ValueError` being raised due to an inconsistency in the inferred frequency from the passed values and the custom business hour frequency.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the custom business hour frequency is correctly validated within the `apply` function. This can be achieved by adjusting the handling of frequencies to align with the expected behavior.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            if self.freq == CustomBusinessHour(start=self.start, end=self.end, holidays=self.holidays):
                return other
            else:
                raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This updated version ensures that the custom business hour frequency is correctly validated within the function. Additionally, it only returns the input `other` if it matches the expected custom business hour frequency, otherwise, it raises a `ApplyTypeError` indicating the unsupported combination.
