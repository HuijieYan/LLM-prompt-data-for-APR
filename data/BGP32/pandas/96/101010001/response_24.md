### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is a method within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The error message indicates a failure in validating the frequency for a `CustomBusinessHour` frequency, suggesting that the inferred frequency does not match the passed frequency.
3. The bug seems to be related to how the `apply` function handles adjusting the datetime based on business hours. It involves multiple calculations to adjust the datetime, and the issue likely lies in how these adjustments are made.
4. The error message specifically mentions that the inferred frequency is `None`, which should not be the case when using a `CustomBusinessHour` frequency. This discrepancy causes the validation to fail.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments made within the `apply` function correctly handle the given `CustomBusinessHour` frequency and ensure that the inferred frequency matches the intended frequency based on the adjustments made.

### Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    if n >= 0:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                    else:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, adjustments are made to ensure that the inferred frequency is correctly handled based on the adjustments made to the datetime within the business hours context. This revised logic should resolve the issue with the frequency validation.
