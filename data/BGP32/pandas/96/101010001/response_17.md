The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file. The function is supposed to modify a given datetime object based on the business hour frequency set in the class attributes. The function encounters an error related to frequency validation when used in a test scenario involving custom business hours.

### Error Analysis:
1. The error message indicates a `ValueError` is raised during frequency validation.
2. The line causing the error is within the `apply` function at the part where adjustments are made to the provided datetime object based on the business hour frequency.
3. The specific error message "Inferred frequency None from passed values does not conform to passed frequency CBH" indicates a mismatch between the inferred frequency and the desired custom business hour frequency.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function fails to handle the custom business hour frequency correctly, leading to a mismatch during validation. This means that the adjustments made to the datetime object based on the business hour frequency are inconsistent with the custom business hours defined in the test scenario, causing the validation failure.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments made in the `apply` function adhere to the custom business hour frequency specified in the test scenario to pass the validation. This involves aligning the adjustments made within the function with the provided custom business hour frequency.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            if self.is_on_offset(other):
                return other
            
            bd_normalized = self._next_opening_time(other)
    
            if pd.DatetimeIndex([bd_normalized]).to_period('B') == other.to_period('B'):
                other = bd_normalized
            else:
                if other < bd_normalized:
                    other = bd_normalized
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(
                        self._next_opening_time(bd_normalized),
                    )
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, adjustments are made to the datetime object based on the business hour frequency logic while ensuring compliance with the custom business hour frequency specified in the test scenario. This modification should resolve the validation error encountered in the failing test.
