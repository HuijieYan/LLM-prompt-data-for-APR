### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is trying to adjust a given datetime value based on business hours. The error message is indicating a failure related to frequency validation when using a CustomBusinessHour object. The issue seems to stem from how the frequency is handled in the datetime index generation process.

### Error Location:
The error is occurring in the `_validate_frequency` method, which is called during the generation of the datetime index using the CustomBusinessHour frequency.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. The `is_period_dtype` check in the `_validate_frequency` method may be returning `False` for non-fixed frequencies.
2. The `np.array_equal` check for equality between the index values and the generated frequency values is failing.
3. The error message suggests that the inferred frequency is `None`, which does not conform to the passed frequency string.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug:
1. Ensure that the `is_period_dtype` check is correct and considers non-fixed frequencies appropriately.
2. Investigate why the `np.array_equal` check is failing and ensure the correct comparison is being made.
3. Address the issue of the inferred frequency being `None` and adjust the logic to handle this case properly.
