### Analysis:
- The error message indicates that the frequency generated from the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency. This error occurs during the validation of the frequency for a Datetime Array/Index or Timedelta Array/Index.
- The failing test involves using a `CustomBusinessHour` frequency where the bug seems to be in the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class.
- The `apply` function is supposed to combine business hour with datetime, but the bug in the implementation is causing it to generate incorrect frequencies.
- The error message suggests that the inferred frequency is `None`, which should have been `CBH` (CustomBusinessHour).

### Bug:
- The bug seems to stem from the calculation and adjustment of dates and times within the `apply` function. The logic for adjusting the `other` datetime is incorrect, leading to the incorrect frequency being generated.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting the datetime `other` within the function `_adjust` needs to be carefully reviewed and corrected to ensure that the final output aligns with the expected frequency.
- Specifically, the adjustments for moving to the next business day, handling business hours, and adjusting by business days need to be reviewed and fixed.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            # Adjustment based on n value
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # Move to previous business day
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the adjustments made to the `other` datetime within the `apply` function, the bug causing the incorrect frequency generation should be resolved. This fix will ensure that the frequencies align correctly with the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency provided in the failing test.
