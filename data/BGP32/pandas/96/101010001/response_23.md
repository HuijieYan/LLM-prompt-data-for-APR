The buggy function `apply` is trying to adjust the datetime `other` based on the business hours specified in the class. The error message indicates a mismatch between the inferred frequency `None` and the passed frequency `CBH`. This error occurs in the `_validate_frequency` method during a test involving a custom business hour frequency.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The error might be related to how the `freq` parameter is being handled and validated in the `apply` function.
2. There could be an issue with the comparison between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to arise from the fact that the functionality to validate the frequency of the business hour offset is missing or incorrect in the `apply` function. The error message indicates that the inferred frequency is `None`, which does not match the passed frequency `CBH`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the frequency validation mechanism in the `_validate_frequency` method is correct and properly handles custom business hours.
2. Make sure that the frequency being passed to the `apply` function is correctly interpreted and handled within the function.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Check if the frequency is a custom business hour
            if isinstance(self, CustomBusinessHour):
                if not self.on_offset(other):
                    if self.n >= 0:
                        other = self.next_opening_time(other)
                    else:
                        other = self.prev_opening_time(other)
                        other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
    
            # Adjust the datetime based on business hours
            business_hours_sec = sum(self.get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
            business_days, remaining_minutes = divmod(abs(self.n * 60), business_hours_sec // 60)
    
            if self.n < 0:
                business_days, remaining_minutes = -business_days, -remaining_minutes
    
            if business_days != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=business_days)
    
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self.prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            business_hours_remain = timedelta(minutes=remaining_minutes)
    
            if self.n >= 0:
                while business_hours_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self.get_closing_time(self.prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if business_hours_remain < bhour:
                        other += business_hours_remain
                        business_hours_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        business_hours_remain -= bhour
                        other = self.next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while business_hours_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self.next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if business_hours_remain > bhour:
                        other += business_hours_remain
                        business_hours_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        business_hours_remain -= bhour
                        other = self.get_closing_time(self.next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version of the function, the custom business hour frequency is properly handled within the `apply` function, ensuring that the adjustments are made correctly. This should resolve the frequency validation issue faced in the failing test.
