### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is designed to adjust datetime values based on business hours. The error message indicates a failure in the frequency validation when constructing a `DatetimeIndex` with a `CustomBusinessHour` frequency.

### Potential Error Location:
The error likely occurs in the `apply` function of `BusinessHourMixin` while processing the datetime values and adjusting them based on business hours.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by a mismatch between the inferred frequency of the datetime values and the specified `CustomBusinessHour` frequency during the adjustment process.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the inferred frequency matches the passed frequency when constructing the `DatetimeIndex`.
2. Verify that the interaction between datetime values and the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency is consistent.

This corrected version incorporates adjustments to ensure that the inferred frequency aligns with the specified `CustomBusinessHour` frequency when constructing the `DatetimeIndex`.
