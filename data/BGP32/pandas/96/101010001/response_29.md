### Analysis:
- The error message indicates that there is a validation error related to the frequency passed to the function.
- The failing test involves the use of a CustomBusinessHour frequency with specific start and holidays.
- The error occurs during frequency validation in the `_validate_frequency` method of the DatetimeArray class.

### Potential Error Locations:
- The issue might be related to how the CustomBusinessHour frequency is handled in the `apply` function.
- The problem could arise from how the business hours are calculated and adjusted within the `apply` function.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the frequency validation failing when using a CustomBusinessHour frequency due to an inconsistency between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency in certain circumstances.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Ensure that the CustomBusinessHour frequency is correctly processed within the `apply` function.
- Validate the frequency using the provided methodology in the `_validate_frequency` method of the DatetimeArray class.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            if isinstance(self, CustomBusinessHour):
                freqstr = str(self)
                if 'CBH' not in freqstr:
                    raise ValueError("Invalid CustomBusinessHour frequency format")
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            # Calculate business hours
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd
    
            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = (self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other)
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying these changes, the corrected `apply` function should handle the CustomBusinessHour frequency correctly and pass the failing test without causing a frequency validation error.
