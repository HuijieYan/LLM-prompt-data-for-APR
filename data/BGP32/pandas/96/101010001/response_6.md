### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates that the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency, causing a `ValueError` to be raised.
2. The bug seems to be related to the frequency validation in the `_validate_frequency` method, where the inferred frequency and the passed frequency are not matching.
3. The bug is likely in the calculation of the inferred frequency, which is leading to the mismatch.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the inferred frequency matches the passed frequency in the `CustomBusinessHour` class and the `apply` method.
5. We should also consider if there are any issues related to the business hour calculations that might impact the frequency validation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the assignment and calculation of the inferred frequency in the `CustomBusinessHour` class.
2. Verify that the `apply` method is correctly handling the business hour logic and frequency calculations.
3. Ensure that the `apply` method is returning datetime objects with the correct frequency for the `DatetimeIndex`.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` Method:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            # Calculate inferred frequency
            inferred_freq = other.freqstr

            if inferred_freq is None or inferred_freq != self.freq.freqstr:
                raise ValueError(f"Inferred frequency {inferred_freq} does not match passed frequency {self.freq.freqstr}")

            # Adjust the datetime object based on business hours
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # Calculate business hours
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # Adjust by business days
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)

                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd

            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other

                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

                    if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and other.nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return as_datetime(other, self.freq)

        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By ensuring that the frequency calculations and datetime adjustments are in line with the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency, this corrected version should resolve the `ValueError` issue.
