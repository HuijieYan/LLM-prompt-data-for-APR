### Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `apply` function in the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The error message indicates that the frequency does not conform to the expected CustomBusinessHour frequency. This error is triggered when trying to generate a date range with a custom frequency.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The adjustment of `other` based on the conditions (`n >= 0` and `n < 0`) might be incorrect.
2. The way business days are skipped and adjusted within the loop could be problematic.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the `apply` function to mishandle the adjustment of `other` when dealing with negative offsets and adjusting the business days.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the logic for adjusting `other` based on the sign of `n`.
2. Review how business days are being skipped and adjusted within the loop.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                        other = other + bhour_remain
                        break
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other = other + bhour_remain
                        break
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version adjusts the logic for adjusting `other` based on the offset sign and modifies the way business days are skipped and adjusted within the loop to handle the business hour intervals correctly.
