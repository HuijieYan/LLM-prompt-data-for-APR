### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is intended to adjust a given datetime object based on business hours and days. The error message indicates a problem with the validated frequency when using a custom business hour. It seems that the `apply` function is not correctly handling the frequency validation for the custom business hour.

### Bug Location:
The bug is likely located in the implementation of the `apply` function when handling the custom business hour frequency validation.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect frequency validation for the custom business hour, resulting in a `ValueError` when comparing the inferred frequency with the passed frequency in the test scenario.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the frequency validation logic within the `apply` function should be reviewed and corrected to properly handle the custom business hour frequency.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                raise ApplyTypeError("Given datetime is not a valid offset time")

            n = self.n

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            minutes_adjusted = n * 60 % businesshours

            adjusted = other

            if minutes_adjusted != 0:
                if n >= 0:
                    adjusted = self._adjust_forward(adjusted, minutes_adjusted)
                else:
                    adjusted = self._adjust_backward(adjusted, minutes_adjusted)

            return adjusted
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, the frequency validation logic has been removed since it was unnecessary for adjusting the datetime object based on business hours. The adjustment is now done straightforwardly based on the business hours without considering the frequency validation.
