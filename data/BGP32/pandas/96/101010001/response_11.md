### Analysis:
The error message indicates a validation error for a custom frequency pattern within a DatetimeIndex object. The bug likely stems from the way the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency is being handled within the `apply` method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The error message specifically mentions that the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency `CBH`, which is unique to the custom business hour frequency pattern used.

### Bug Location:
The bug seems to be related to how the custom frequency is being validated and processed within the `apply` method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The error arises during the comparison of inferred frequency with the custom frequency pattern `CBH`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not handling the custom business hour frequency pattern correctly when validating the frequency within the `apply` method. The comparison between the inferred frequency and the custom frequency is not aligning as expected, leading to the validation error.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the custom business hour frequency pattern appropriately within the `apply` method. Specifically, ensuring that the custom frequency is correctly processed and validated against the inferred frequency to avoid the validation error.

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

This corrected version ensures that the custom business hour frequency pattern is handled correctly within the `apply` method, addressing the validation error related to the frequency mismatch.
