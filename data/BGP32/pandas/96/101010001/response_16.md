### Analysis:
- The error message is indicating a ValueError in the `_validate_frequency` method of the pandas library.
- The failing test is related to creating a `DatetimeIndex` with a custom business hour frequency.
- The bug seems to be due to a mismatch between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency, causing the validation to fail.

### Bug:
The bug lies in the `apply` method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The logic for adjusting the given datetime based on business hours seems to be causing the issue. The adjustment of the datetime is not aligning correctly with the custom business hour frequency, leading to a mismatch between inferred and passed frequencies.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Adjust the logic in the `apply` method to correctly align the adjustments with the custom business hour frequency.
- Ensure that the adjustments consider the custom business hours specified and adjust the datetime accordingly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # other methods ...

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            if self.is_on_offset(other):
                return other

            adjusted_dt = other
            while n > 0:
                adjusted_dt = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_dt)
                n -= 1

            while n < 0:
                adjusted_dt = self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_dt)
                n += 1

            return adjusted_dt
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version adjusts the given datetime based on the custom business hour frequency specified in the class. It ensures that the adjustments align correctly with the business hours to avoid the frequency validation error.
