### Analysis:
The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The error message indicates that the frequency of the passed values is causing a validation error related to the CustomBusinessHour. The issue seems to be with the comparison of frequencies in the function `_validate_frequency`.
The traceback suggests that the error is due to the fact that the inferred frequency from the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency (CBH).

### Error Cause:
The error occurs when the passed frequency does not match the inferred frequency from the values. This discrepancy triggers a ValueError in the frequency validation process.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the inferred frequency calculated from the passed values matches the specified frequency (CBH) in the CustomBusinessHour.

### Corrected Function:
```python
    # this is the corrected version of the function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            business_hours = sum(
                (en - st).total_seconds() for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            normalized_time = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
    
            normalized_time = self._get_opening_time(normalized_time)
    
            if n != 0:
                normalized_time += timedelta(seconds=n * 60)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while normalized_time.time() not in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(normalized_time):
                    normalized_time = self._get_opening_time(normalized_time + timedelta(seconds=1 * 60))
            else:
                while normalized_time.time() not in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(normalized_time):
                    normalized_time = self._get_opening_time(normalized_time - timedelta(seconds=1 * 60))
    
            return normalized_time
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By initializing `normalized_time` with the adjusted time based on the specified frequency and using it for comparison, the corrected function should properly handle the validation of the frequency and resolve the issue.
