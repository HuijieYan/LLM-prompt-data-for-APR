### Analysis:
- The buggy function is named `apply` and is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class.
- The function is supposed to adjust a given timestamp (`other`) based on business hours and days.
- The issue reported on GitHub relates to `pd.date_range` producing more periods than expected when using `pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour` with holidays.
- The buggy function takes into account business hours, days, total hours, and adjusts the timestamp accordingly.
- The bug may be related to how holidays are handled in the adjustment logic of the function.
- The function needs to correctly adjust the timestamp based on business hours and days while considering holidays.

### Bug Cause:
The bug might be caused by inconsistencies in handling holidays within the adjustment logic. It seems that holidays are not properly considered when calculating the number of periods based on business hours. This results in an incorrect number of periods being generated when holidays are included in the calculation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, it's essential to ensure that holidays are properly accounted for when calculating the number of periods in the given business hours. The adjustment logic needs to skip holidays and adjust the timestamp correctly based on the specified business hours and days.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
from pandas._libs.tslibs.timedeltas import Timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond
            )
            n = self.n
    
            scheduled_hours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(start, end)
                for start, end in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            remaining_hours, remainder = divmod(abs(n * 60), scheduled_hours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                remaining_hours, remainder = -remaining_hours, -remainder
    
            if remaining_hours != 0:
                skip_days = BusinessDay(n=remaining_hours)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_opening = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain_time = other - prev_opening
                    other = prev_opening + skip_days + remain_time
                else:
                    other = other + skip_days
    
            remaining_time = timedelta(minutes=remainder)
    
            while remaining_time != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    current_closing_time = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))
                else:
                    current_closing_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
    
                working_hours_left = current_closing_time - other
                if working_hours_left >= remaining_time:
                    other += remaining_time
                    remaining_time = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    remaining_time -= working_hours_left
                    if n >= 0:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(current_closing_time)
                    else:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(current_closing_time - timedelta(seconds=1))
        return other
```

This corrected version should properly handle business hours, consider holidays, and adjust the timestamp accordingly, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
