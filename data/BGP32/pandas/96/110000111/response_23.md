### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `BusinessHourMixin` module.
2. The function is intended to adjust a given datetime based on custom business hours.
3. The bug may be related to the adjustment logic within the function.
4. The issue posted on GitHub relates to date_range producing more periods than expected when holidays are added to the custom business hour frequency.

### Bug Cause:
The bug within the `apply` function may be causing unexpected adjustments to the input datetime, leading to incorrect output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the adjustments made to the input datetime align with the business hour definitions.
2. Check the handling of negative business hours for accurate adjustments.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if self._is_on_offset(other):
            return other
    
        self._validate()
        normalized = self.normalize(other)
        n = self.n
        
        if n >= 0:
            end_dt = self.apply_previous(normalized)
            if normalized.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(normalized):
                while end_dt <= normalized:
                    end_dt = self._next_opening_time(end_dt)
                return end_dt
        else:
            start_dt = self.apply_next(normalized)
            if normalized.time() in self.start:
                while start_dt >= normalized:
                    start_dt = self._prev_closing_time(start_dt)
                return start_dt
        
        business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
        
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        dt = normalized
        if bd != 0:
            dt = self.shift_period(dt, self.next_bday, bd)
        
        if r != 0:
            dt = self.shift_period(dt, timedelta(minutes=r))
        
        return dt
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should address the bug in the `apply` function and provide the expected output values across all mentioned test cases.
