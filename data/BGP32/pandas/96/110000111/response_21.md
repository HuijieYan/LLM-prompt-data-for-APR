### Analysis
1. The buggy function is `apply` within the class `BusinessHourMixin`.
2. The function is supposed to adjust the input `other` datetime object based on certain business hour criteria.
3. The bug seems to be causing incorrect adjustments to the `other` datetime object, possibly leading to wrong business hours calculations.
4. The issue reported on GitHub involves the behavior of `pd.date_range` when using periods and adding holidays, which relates to the buggy function's incorrect handling of business hours with holidays.
5. To fix the bug, ensure that the adjustments to the `other` datetime object and business hour calculations are accurate based on the provided business hour settings.

### Bug Explanation
The bug seems to be caused by incorrect adjustments made to the `other` datetime object within the `apply` function. The logic for handling positive and negative business hour offsets, along with dealing with holidays and business hour intervals, seems to be flawed. This results in incorrect adjustments and unexpected behavior, as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Implement accurate calculations for adjusting the `other` datetime object based on positive and negative business hour offsets.
2. Ensure correct handling of holidays within the business hour calculations.
3. Verify that the adjustments are made to the correct business hour intervals.
4. Test the function with different scenarios to validate the corrections made.

### Corrected Function
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            if n >= 0:
                while n > 0:
                    if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other += timedelta(hours=1)
                    n -= 1
            else:
                while n < 0:
                    if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                    other -= timedelta(hours=1)
                    n += 1
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version simplifies the adjustment process by accurately iterating over the business hours according to the positive or negative offset specified. It ensures correct handling of holidays and adherence to the business hour intervals. Testing this corrected function with the provided cases should reflect the expected behavior and resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
