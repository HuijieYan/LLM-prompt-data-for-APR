### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply()` is supposed to adjust the given timestamp based on business hours specified in the `CustomBusinessHour` class. The function seems to have issues handling the adjustment correctly, leading to unexpected results.

### Identified Errors:
1. Incorrect handling of the given timestamp and adjustments.
2. Inconsistent logic for adjusting the timestamp based on business hours.
3. Issues with checking if the provided timestamp is on a business day.

### Bug Cause:
The bug likely originates from inaccurate calculations and adjustments in the function. In cases where adjustments are needed for business days and business hours, the function fails to apply the correct logic, leading to incorrect results.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure accurate handling of the provided timestamp and adjustments.
2. Implement consistent logic for adjusting the timestamp based on business hours and days.
3. Improve the checks for verifying if the timestamp is on a business day.

### Bug-fixed Code:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            
            if self._is_on_offset(other):
                return other
            
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
            
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd
            
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                
                if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    if n >= 0:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                    else:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1))
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By refining the adjustments, ensuring accurate business hour calculations, and refining the logic for handling timestamp adjustments, this corrected version of the `apply()` function should address the identified issues and satisfy the expected input/output values.
