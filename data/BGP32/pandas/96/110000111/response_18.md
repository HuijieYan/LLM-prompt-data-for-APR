### Analysis
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class which is inherited from `BusinessMixin`.
2. The function is supposed to perform calculations on datetime objects based on business hours and days.
3. The bug is causing incorrect behavior in handling business hours and days, leading to unexpected datetime outputs.
4. The GitHub issue indicates a problem with generating date ranges when using periods and adding holidays, which aligns with the buggy function's purpose.

### Error Locations
1. Incorrect handling of adjustments based on business days and remaining hours.
2. Incorrect comparisons and calculations within the while loops.
3. Mishandling of adjustments for positive and negative `n`.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is likely caused by errors in the calculation logic of adjusting datetime objects based on business hours and days. This includes incorrect comparisons, adjustments, and handling of different scenarios related to business days and remaining hours.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Correctly adjust the datetime objects based on business days and remaining hours for both positive and negative `n`.
2. Ensure proper comparisons and adjustments within the while loops.
3. Verify adjustments for various edge cases to ensure correct behavior.

### Bug-fixed Code
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            other_ts = other
            if n >= 0:
                while bd != 0:
                    other_ts = self.next_bday.apply(other_ts)
                    bd -= 1
    
                while r != 0:
                    opening_time = self._next_opening_time(other_ts)
                    closing_time = self._get_closing_time(opening_time)
                    bhour_remain = closing_time - other_ts
                    if bhour_remain < timedelta(minutes=r):
                        other_ts = closing_time
                        r -= 60
                    else:
                        other_ts += timedelta(minutes=r)
                        r = 0
            else:
                while bd != 0:
                    other_ts = self.prev_bday.apply(other_ts)
                    bd += 1
    
                while r != 0:
                    opening_time = self._prev_opening_time(other_ts)
                    closing_time = self._get_closing_time(opening_time)
                    bhour_remain = other_ts - closing_time
                    if bhour_remain < timedelta(minutes=abs(r)):
                        other_ts = closing_time
                        r += 60
                    else:
                        other_ts -= timedelta(minutes=abs(r))
                        r = 0
    
            return other_ts
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This revised code should address the issue by correctly adjusting the datetime objects based on business days and remaining hours according to the specific business conditions.
