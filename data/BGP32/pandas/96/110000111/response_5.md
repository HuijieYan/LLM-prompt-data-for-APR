### Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class and is used to adjust a given datetime based on business hours. The function takes an input datetime, applies business hour adjustments, considers business days, and calculates the final adjusted datetime.

The bug seems to be related to incorrect adjustment of the given datetime for business hours and days, leading to unexpected output in certain scenarios.

### Error Locations
1. Adjustment of datetime based on business hours and days.
2. Calculation of business hours and days for adjustment.
3. Handling of positive and negative values for `self.n`.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs due to a miscalculation in adjusting the input datetime for business hours and days, especially when the given datetime is near the edge conditions of business intervals. This leads to discrepancies in the final adjusted datetime.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Ensure correct adjustments are made for positive and negative `self.n` values.
2. Properly handle the edge conditions of business intervals for accurate adjustments.
3. Verify the calculations for business hours and days to ensure correct adjustments are made.

### Code Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        # Adjust datetime based on business hours
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        
        # Calculate total business hours in a day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        # Calculate business days and remaining business hours
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + BusinessDay(n=bd) + remain
            else:
                other = other + BusinessDay(n=bd)
        
        # Remaining business hours adjustment
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        # Iteratively adjust the datetime based on remaining business hours
        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and other.nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should address the issue in the `apply` function by accurately adjusting the input datetime according to business hours and days.
