### Analysis
1. The function `apply` is intended to adjust a given `datetime` object based on business hours specified in the `CustomBusinessHour` class.
2. The function initializes variables, adjusts the input `datetime` object to the nearest business hours, calculates business hours, adjusts the input according to business days and remaining hours, and finally returns the adjusted `datetime`.
3. The bug seems to be related to incorrect adjustment and calculations leading to unexpected results.
4. The bug might be caused by mistakes in adjusting the input datetime and calculating remaining hours.
5. Strategy for fixing the bug: Ensure proper adjustment of the input `datetime` object, accurate calculation of remaining hours, and correct handling of business day adjustments.

### Bug Fix
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )

            n = self.n

            # Adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # Adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)

            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = other + skip_bd

            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                if n >= 0:
                    next_open = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    bhour = next_open - other
                else:
                    closing_time = self._get_closing_time(other)
                    bhour = closing_time - other

                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    other = next_open if n >= 0 else closing_time
                    bhour_remain -= bhour

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function should now handle the input datetime correctly, adjust it based on business hours and days, and calculate the remaining hours accurately, thereby fixing the bug identified in the GitHub issue as well.
