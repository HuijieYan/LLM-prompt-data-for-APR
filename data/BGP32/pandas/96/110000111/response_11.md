### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class. It takes a `datetime` object and adjusts it based on business hours.
2. The function manipulates the input `datetime` object according to the specified business hours and other parameters.
3. The bug may be related to incorrectly calculating business hours and adjusting the input `datetime` object, resulting in unexpected and incorrect output. This explains the issue posted on GitHub regarding discrepancies in date ranges when using periods and adding holidays.
4. The bug can be fixed by thoroughly reviewing the calculations and adjustments made within the function to ensure correct handling of business hours and holidays.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of business hours and holidays within the `apply` function. The adjustments made to the `other` datetime object based on the business hours and the logic for transitioning between different time intervals are likely flawed, causing the function to return incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Review the logic for adjusting the `other` datetime object to ensure that it correctly aligns with the specified business hours.
2. Validate the calculations related to business hours, weekdays, holidays, and transitions between different time intervals.
3. Ensure that the adjustments made to the `other` datetime object are accurate and follow the expected business hour behavior.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# Fix the buggy function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0)

        # adjust the input datetime object based on business hours and holidays
        other = self._adjust_datetime_within_business_hours(other, n)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

def _adjust_datetime_within_business_hours(self, dt, n):
    if n >= 0:
        if dt.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(dt):
            dt = self._next_opening_time(dt)
    else:
        if dt.time() in self.start:
            dt -= timedelta(seconds=1)
        if not self._is_on_offset(dt):
            dt = self._next_opening_time(dt)
            dt = self._get_closing_time(dt)

    # handle the adjustments for business days and remaining business hours
    dt = self._adjust_business_days(dt, n)
    dt = self._adjust_remaining_business_hours(dt, n)
    
    return dt

def _adjust_business_days(self, dt, n):
    businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
    bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
    if n < 0:
        bd, r = -bd, -r

    if bd != 0:
        skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
        if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(dt):
            prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(dt)
            remain = dt - prev_open
            dt = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
        else:
            dt += skip_bd

    return dt

def _adjust_remaining_business_hours(self, dt, n):
    bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

    if n >= 0:
        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(dt)) - dt
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                dt += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                dt = self._next_opening_time(dt + bhour)
    else:
        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._next_opening_time(dt) - dt
            if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                dt += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                dt = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(dt + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

    return dt
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function should address the bug and ensure that the adjustments made to the `other` datetime object align with the specified business hours and holidays, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
