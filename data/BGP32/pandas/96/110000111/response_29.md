### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is meant to adjust a given timestamp based on custom business hours. The bug seems to cause the adjustment to fail or produce incorrect results in certain cases, as indicated by the GitHub issue where adding holidays leads to unexpected behavior with `pd.date_range`.

### Potential Errors:
1. Incorrect adjustment of the input timestamp.
2. Misbehavior in handling positive/negative business hours.
3. Incorrect handling of business days.
4. Potential issues with adjusting remaining business hours.
5. Inaccurate logic for moving to the next business time interval.

### Bug Cause:
The bug might be due to the improper adjustment of the input timestamp when dealing with holidays and other edge conditions. This leads to incorrect calculations of business days and remaining business hours, which results in unexpected output in the `pd.date_range`.

### Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug, ensure proper handling of holidays, accurate adjustments for business days and hours, correct logic for moving to the next business time interval, and improved calculation of adjusted timestamps.
