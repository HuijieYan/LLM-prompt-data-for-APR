### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is a method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `offsets.py` file of the `pandas` library.
2. The function takes an input `other` which should be a `datetime` object, and performs operations based on the values of `other`, `self`, and several other attributes of the class.
3. The bug seems to be related to the adjustment of the input `other` time based on the business hours and handling of business days, resulting in unexpected output dates.
4. The correction strategy involves refining the logic for adjusting dates based on business hours and business days to ensure the correct output is generated.
5. A corrected version of the `apply` function is provided below based on the analysis and expected input/output values.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
            n = self.n
            adjusted_time = other

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    adjusted_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    adjusted_time -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    adjusted_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    adjusted_time = self._get_closing_time(adjusted_time)
            
            days_to_adjust = n // businesshours
            remaining_minutes = abs(n * 60) % (businesshours // 60)

            if n < 0:
                days_to_adjust = -days_to_adjust
                remaining_minutes = -remaining_minutes

            if days_to_adjust != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=days_to_adjust)
                adjusted_time = adjusted_time + skip_bd
            
            while remaining_minutes > 0:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_time) - adjusted_time
                if remaining_minutes >= bhour.total_seconds() // 60:
                    adjusted_time += bhour
                    remaining_minutes -= bhour.total_seconds() // 60
                else:
                    adjusted_time += timedelta(minutes=remaining_minutes)
                    remaining_minutes = 0

            return adjusted_time
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `apply` function refines the logic for adjusting dates based on business hours and business days while considering the input `other`, the attributes of the class `self`, and the expected output values. This should address the issue reported on GitHub and generate the expected output for various test cases.
