### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is a method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which is a subclass of `BusinessMixin`.
2. The function takes an input parameter `other`, which is expected to be a `datetime` object. It performs various calculations based on the input and returns a modified `datetime` object.
3. The bug seems to be related to business hours calculation, adjustment, and holiday handling within the function.
4. The bug can lead to incorrect adjustments of business hours, resulting in unexpected datetime values as observed in the failing cases.
5. To fix the bug, we need to review and correct the logic related to adjusting business hours, handling holidays, and calculating the final datetime value.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to incorrect calculations and adjustments within the `apply` function, especially in handling business days, remaining business hours, and transitioning between business time intervals. This leads to the incorrect output datetime values observed in the failing test cases.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Correct the adjustment of business days before handling remaining business hours to ensure the correct number of business days are adjusted.
2. Properly calculate and adjust the remaining business hours based on the given business time intervals.
3. Adjust the logic for transitioning between different business time intervals to handle the remaining business hours accurately.
4. Ensure proper handling of holidays to avoid incorrect adjustments and output datetime values.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)

            # Adjust by business days first to ensure correct adjustment
            if bd != 0:
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        break
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour - timedelta(seconds=1) or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        break
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

This corrected version ensures the proper adjustment of business days, handling of remaining business hours, and correct transitioning between business time intervals. It should yield the expected output datetime values for the specified test cases and resolve the issue mentioned on GitHub.
