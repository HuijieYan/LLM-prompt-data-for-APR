### Analysis
The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is causing issues with adjusting datetime objects based on business hours and specified offset times. The function is meant to adjust the given datetime object based on the business hours defined in the class, but it seems to have multiple logical errors that lead to incorrect adjustments.

### Potential Error Locations
1. Calculation of business hours in seconds.
2. Adjusting the datetime object based on the business days.
3. Adjusting the remaining business hours in different cases.

### Bug Explanation
The bug stems from incorrect adjustments made to the datetime object `other` based on the defined business hours, business days, and remaining business hours. These adjustments are leading to incorrect outputs, straying from the expected behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling business days, remaining business hours, and adjusting the datetime object accordingly. Correct calculations and adjustments need to be made based on the specified business hours and offset times.

### Updated Function code
```python
# The corrected version of the apply function
# Fixed logical errors within the function
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        other = datetime(
            other.year, other.month, other.day, other.hour, other.minute, other.second, other.microsecond
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        total_business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        
        business_days, remaining_hours = divmod(abs(n * 60), total_business_hours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            business_days, remaining_hours = -business_days, -remaining_hours

        if business_days != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=business_days)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        remaining_hours_td = timedelta(minutes=remaining_hours)

        while remaining_hours_td != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if remaining_hours_td < bhour:
                    other += remaining_hours_td
                    remaining_hours_td = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    remaining_hours_td -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if remaining_hours_td >= bhour or (remaining_hours_td == bhour and other.nanosecond != 0):
                    other += remaining_hours_td
                    remaining_hours_td = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    remaining_hours_td -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the logical errors in the `apply` function, the adjustment of datetime objects based on specified business hours and days should now correctly reflect the expected behavior in all cases mentioned.
