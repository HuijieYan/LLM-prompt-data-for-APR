### Analysis
1. The buggy function `apply` is used to adjust a given `datetime` object according to business hours defined in the `CustomBusinessHour` class.
2. The function checks if the `other` parameter is an instance of `datetime` and then proceeds with the adjustments.
3. The bug seems to be related to the handling of adjusting business days and business hours within a day, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
4. The bug is likely responsible for the issue reported on GitHub where the number of periods generated by `pd.date_range` with holidays does not match the expected count.

### Bug Explanation
- The bug likely occurs when adjusting the datetime object for business days (`skip_bd` variable) and the remaining business hours within a day (`bhour_remain` variable).
- There are issues with the logic for adjusting the business days and hours when the number of hours is negative or the remaining business hours are not correctly accounted for.
- This leads to the function returning incorrect datetime values, as seen in the GitHub issue where the number of generated periods is incorrect.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Refactor the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours within a day to ensure accurate adjustments.
2. Check the conditions for adjusting business days and hours in both positive and negative scenarios.
3. Validate the adjustments made to the `other` datetime object to align with the expected business hours and days accurately.

### Bug-fixed Function
```python
# The corrected version of the apply function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
    
        if other.time() not in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
    
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
    
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other = other + skip_bd
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd
    
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                break
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other) + timedelta(hours=1)
    
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected function restructures the adjustment logic for business days and remaining business hours within a day to ensure accurate handling of the datetime object. This should resolve the bug and align the outputs with the expected values in all the provided test cases.
