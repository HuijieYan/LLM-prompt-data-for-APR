### Analysis
The buggy function is meant to adjust a given datetime based on business hours specified in the `CustomBusinessHour` object. The function calculates the business hours, adjusts the datetime by business days first, and then by remaining business hours. However, due to the bug, the function is producing unexpected results.

### Potential Error Locations
1. Incorrect adjustments for positive and negative `n` values.
2. Inaccurate handling of business hours and business days calculations.
3. Incorrect assignment of `other` variable in certain conditions.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug arises from how the function handles adjustments for positive and negative `n` values. There are issues in adjusting the time intervals and moving to the next opening or closing times. These inaccuracies lead to incorrect datetime adjustments.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Update the adjustment process for positive and negative `n` values to correctly account for moving between business hours.
2. Ensure accurate calculation of business days and business hours to adjust the datetime correctly.
3. Correctly handle the assignment of `other` variable based on the conditions encountered.

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,

            other.second,
            other.microsecond,

            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n) * 60, businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After correcting the function, it should accurately adjust the given datetime based on the specified CustomBusinessHour offsets.
