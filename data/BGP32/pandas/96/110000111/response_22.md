### Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file. It is supposed to adjust a given datetime object based on the business hour logic defined by the class. The function encounters issues in properly adjusting the datetime object within business hours, leading to incorrect outputs.

### Error Locations
1. Failure in adjusting `other` based on business days.
2. Incorrect handling of remaining business hours.
3. Incorrect computation of business time intervals.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises due to incorrect adjustments being made to the input datetime object (`other`) as well as issues with managing the remaining business hours. These errors result in the function returning incorrect datetime values, leading to the unexpected behavior reported in the GitHub issue.

### Fix Strategy
1. Adjust the business day calculation for proper handling.
2. Correct the computation for remaining business hours.
3. Address the logic for advancing to the next business time interval.

### Bug-Fixed Code
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            while n != 0:
                if n > 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
    
                if abs(n) * 60 >= bhour.total_seconds() / 60:
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    n -= 1 if n > 0 else 1
                else:
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=abs(n) * 60)
                    n = 0
    
                other += bhour_remain
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By implementing the suggested fixes, the corrected `apply` function should now provide the expected outputs as per the specified test cases.
