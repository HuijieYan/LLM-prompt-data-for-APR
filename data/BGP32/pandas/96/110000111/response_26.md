### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class within the `offsets.py` file.
2. The function takes `self` and `other` as parameters where `other` is expected to be a `datetime` object.
3. The function is meant to adjust the given datetime based on business hours, holidays, and other constraints.
4. The bug likely stems from incorrect adjustments made to the `other` datetime based on different conditions.
5. The function needs to correctly calculate business days, remaining hours, and adjust the datetime accordingly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by incorrect logic in adjusting the datetime based on positive and negative offsets. The calculations regarding business hours, business days, and remaining hours are not being correctly handled, leading to inaccurate datetime adjustments.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Correctly calculate the business days and remaining hours based on the offset.
2. Adjust the datetime based on the calculated business days and remaining hours.
3. Ensure that the adjustments consider both positive and negative offsets properly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
from numpy import timedelta64

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):

                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,

                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)

                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other) + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta64(r, 'm')
    
            while bhour_remain != timedelta64(0, 'm'):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta64(0, 'm')
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and other.nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta64(0, 'm')
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected function should now properly adjust the given datetime according to the business hours and offsets provided.
