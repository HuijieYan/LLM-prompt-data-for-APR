### Analysis:
This buggy function, `apply`, is supposed to adjust a datetime object based on business hours defined by the class properties. The function contains logic to handle different cases of adjusting the input datetime object based on business hours and days. The bug likely stems from improper adjustment or miscalculation of the timedelta values, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Error Locations:
1. Calculation of `businesshours` variable.
2. Adjustment based on business days (`bd` calculation and modification).
3. Business hours adjustment while updating `other`.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug causes the function to incorrectly adjust the input datetime object based on business hours and days. This leads to unexpected changes in the output datetime, which doesn't align with the expected behavior. The issue arises due to improper calculation and adjustment logic in the function, resulting in the return of incorrect datetime values.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure proper calculation of `businesshours` by accurately summing the business hours for each time range.
2. Correct the adjustment logic for business days (`bd`) to align with the intended behavior.
3. Revise the business hours adjustment process to ensure the correct handling of timedelta values for precise datetime adjustments.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 3600), businesshours)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:

                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should address the issues with proper calculation and adjustment in the function, aligning the output datetime values with the expected behavior in the provided test cases and resolving the GitHub issue related to unexpected behavior in `pd.date_range` when using periods and holidays. Make sure to test this corrected function with the provided test cases to ensure its correctness.
