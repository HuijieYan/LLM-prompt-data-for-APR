### Analysis
1. The buggy function `apply` is supposed to adjust a given datetime value based on the business hours specified by the `CustomBusinessHour` object.
2. The function takes a datetime `other` as input along with the `self` object of type `CustomBusinessHour`.
3. The cause of the bug may be related to incorrect handling of time adjustments, which leads to improper calculations and unexpected results.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure correct adjustments are made based on business hours and business days.
5. The corrected version should satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the GitHub issue related to `date_range`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check and correct the adjustments made to the input time to align with business hours.
2. Ensure proper calculations for business days and business hours adjustments.
3. Update the function to return the adjusted datetime value.

### Correction of the Buggy Function

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import apply_wraps
from pandas.tseries.frequencies import CustomBusinessHour, CustomBusinessDay
from pandas._libs.tslibs.timedeltas import Timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            n = self.n

            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            other = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day,
                             other.hour, other.minute, other.second, other.microsecond)

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = Timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != Timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other)) - other
                if n >= 0 or (n < 0 and (bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0))):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = Timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version above, adjustments have been made to ensure correct handling of business hours and days. The function now returns the adjusted datetime value based on the provided business hour settings.
