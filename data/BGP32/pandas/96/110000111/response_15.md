### Analysis:
The buggy function is part of the class `BusinessHourMixin` which is a mixin class for `BusinessMixin`. The `apply` function is meant to adjust a given datetime based on business hours. The function contains logic to handle different cases based on the value of `n` (number of business hours to adjust). However, there are several potential error locations within the function that may cause unexpected behavior.

### Identified Error Locations:
1. Adjusting `other` to remove nanoseconds and time zone information may lead to loss of precision.
2. The calculations involving business hours and adjustments for negative `n` values could be incorrect.
3. Handling of `bhour_remain` and adjusting the datetime accordingly may cause issues.
4. The adjustments for business days (`bd`) and remaining business hours (`r`) calculations might have flaws.
5. Incorrect usage of `timedelta` for time differences may cause unexpected results.

### Bug Explanation:
The issue reported on GitHub mentions that when using `pd.date_range` with a specific frequency that includes holidays, the number of generated periods is incorrect. This can be related to the buggy `apply` function adjusting the datetime incorrectly based on business hours, potentially causing the date range to have more periods than expected.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Maintain the precision of the input datetime `other` during adjustments.
2. Reevaluate the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business hours.
3. Ensure correct handling of remaining business hours and adjustments for both positive and negative values of `n`.
4. Use appropriate methods for datetime adjustments to avoid inconsistencies.
5. Validate each step of the adjustment process to prevent unexpected behavior.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# Corrected version of the apply function
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        other = other

        # Adjust to opening time if needed
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() not in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Calculate total business hours in a day
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        # Adjust by business days
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
            bhour = self._get_business_seconds(self._prev_opening_time(other))
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the function as per the strategy outlined, the adjustments based on business hours should be more accurate and prevent unexpected behavior when generating date ranges with specific frequencies that include holidays.
