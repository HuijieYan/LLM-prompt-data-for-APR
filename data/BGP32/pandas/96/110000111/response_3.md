### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which inherits from `BusinessMixin`. The function is supposed to adjust a given datetime value based on business hours and certain parameters.
2. The function handles different cases based on the value of `n` (number of business hours to adjust). It adjusts the input datetime value accordingly and returns the adjusted datetime.
3. The bug causes unexpected behavior in adjusting the datetime values when considering business hours and holidays. This bug is linked to the reported GitHub issue where `pd.date_range` fails to work correctly with periods and holidays.
4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
   - Ensure that the adjustments to the input datetime are correctly calculated based on business hours and holidays.
   - Check the conditionals and loops that handle adjustments to business hours and make corrections where necessary.

### Bug in the code:
The bug occurs in the adjustments made within the conditional blocks when determining the next business time interval and closing time. This leads to unexpected datetime values being returned.

### Bug fix:
Below is the corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = (
                        self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    )
                    if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other) + bhour
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should address the bug and ensure that the adjustments based on business hours and holidays are handled correctly, aligning with the expected values in the test cases.
