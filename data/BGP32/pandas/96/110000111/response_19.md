### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is supposed to adjust the input datetime value based on business hours. It checks if the input is a `datetime` object, adjusts it according to certain conditions, and returns the adjusted datetime.
2. The potential error locations in the function could be the calculation of `bd` and `r`, the adjustment of `bhour_remain`, and the while loops that handle the remaining business hours.
3. The bug may be caused by incorrect calculations in the adjustment process based on the number of business days (`bd`) and remaining minutes (`r`), which could lead to inaccurate results in adjusting the input datetime.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure correct adjustments of `bd`, `r`, and `bhour_remain`, as well as properly handle the remaining business hours in the while loops.
5. The corrected function is provided below.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # adjusted input datetime
        new_other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0)

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if self.n >= 0:
            if new_other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(new_other):
                new_other = self._next_opening_time(new_other)
        else:
            if new_other.time() in self.start:
                new_other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(new_other):
                new_other = self._next_opening_time(new_other)
                new_other = self._get_closing_time(new_other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(self.n * 60), business_hours // 60)
        # Adjust for negative n
        if self.n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(new_other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(new_other)
                remain = new_other - prev_open
                new_other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                new_other += skip_bd

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        # Adjust remaining business hours
        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
            if self.n >= 0:
                current_bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(new_other)) - new_other
                if bhour_remain < current_bhour:
                    new_other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= current_bhour
                    new_other = self._next_opening_time(new_other + current_bhour)
            else:
                current_bhour = self._next_opening_time(new_other) - new_other
                if bhour_remain >= current_bhour or (bhour_remain == current_bhour and new_other.nanosecond != 0):
                    new_other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= current_bhour
                    new_other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(new_other + current_bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return new_other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected function addresses the calculation issues regarding business days, remaining minutes, and adjusting the remaining business hours. Additionally, it ensures proper handling within the while loops to accurately adjust the input datetime based on business hours.
