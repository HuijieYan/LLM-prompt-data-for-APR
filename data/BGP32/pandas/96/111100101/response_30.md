### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `apply` function arises from an incorrect adjustment of the input `other` datetime based on the business hours specified in the class. The issue primarily occurs in the logic to handle negative offsets (`self.n < 0`). When the offset `n` is negative, the function incorrectly subtracts one second from the input `other` time instead of skipping a business day.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `apply` function, we need to correct the logic for handling negative offsets (`self.n < 0`). Specifically, we need to address the adjustment of the input datetime `other` to account for negative offsets and ensure that the appropriate business day is correctly skipped.

### Bug Fix
Based on the analysis and bug explanation, here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        other = other.replace(microsecond=0)  # Reset nanoseconds

        # adjust for negative offsets
        if n < 0:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(days=1)

        # Loop through business hours and adjust
        for _ in range(abs(n)):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version addresses the issue in handling negative offsets and ensures the correct adjustment of the input datetime based on the specified business hours. This fix should now pass the failing test cases provided.
