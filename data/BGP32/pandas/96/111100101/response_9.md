### Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is meant to adjust a given datetime according to custom business hours. The function seems to have some logic errors in handling the adjustment of business days and business hours.

### Bug
The bug is likely to be in the logic surrounding adjusting the datetime for business days and business hours. The function may not correctly handle negative offsets and may not accurately adjust the datetime based on the business hours.

### Fix Strategy
1. Correct the logic for adjusting the datetime for business days based on the offset.
2. Fix the logic for adjusting the datetime for business hours within a business day.
3. Ensure that the function correctly handles both positive and negative offsets.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)  # Move to opening time
                if n < 0:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other - timedelta(seconds=1))
                while skip_bd > 0:
                    other = self.next_bday.apply(other)
                    skip_bd -= 1
    
            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = (
                    self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other)) - other
                )
                if n >= 0:
                    if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        break
                    else:
                        other = self.next_bday.apply(other)
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                else:
                    if bhour_remain < bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        break
                    else:
                        other = self.next_bday.apply(other)
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

This corrected version should pass the failing test and handle cases with both positive and negative offsets correctly.
