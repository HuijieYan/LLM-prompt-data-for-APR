### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `apply` function lies in the logic for adjusting the input `other` datetime based on the business hours defined by the `CustomBusinessHour` object. The logic for adjusting the datetime based on positive and negative values of `n` is incorrect, leading to incorrect output when calculating the next business time intervals. 

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic for adjusting the input datetime `other` based on the defined business hours and the value of `n`. We should ensure that the adjustment correctly handles both positive and negative values of `n` while considering the start and end times of business hours.

### Bug Fix - Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:
```python
# Import required modules
from datetime import timedelta

# Corrected version of the buggy function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
    
        if n > 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        elif n < 0:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(days=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
    
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other = self.next_bday.next_business_time(other + remain)
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd
    
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
            if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                other += bhour
                bhour_remain -= bhour
            else:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
    
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Changes Made:
1. Adjusted the logic for handling positive and negative values of `n`.
2. Corrected the adjustments to `other` based on the business hours defined, considering the start and end times.
3. Improved the logic for adjusting `other` based on the remaining business hours. 

With these changes, the corrected version of the `apply` function should now pass the failing test cases and produce the expected output.
