### Explanation:
The buggy function `apply` is expected to adjust a given datetime based on business hours specified by the `CustomBusinessHour` object. The function is intended to calculate the new datetime after applying the specified business hours offset.

The bug in the function is likely causing incorrect adjustments to the input datetime `other` when the offset `n` is positive or negative. This leads to unexpected results in the output date values.

### Bug:
The bug occurs due to incorrect adjustments made to the input datetime `other` based on the offset `n`. When `n >= 0`, the function may not correctly handle cases where the time is not in the `self.end` list or when the `_is_on_offset` method returns `False`. Similarly, when `n < 0`, the function may not correctly handle cases where the time is in the `self.start` list. These incorrect adjustments lead to wrong calculations and result in unexpected output datetime values.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly adjust the input datetime according to the specified business hours offset. The adjustments based on positive and negative offsets need to be handled properly to ensure the output datetime is correctly calculated.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function that addresses the bug:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        base_time = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        if n > 0:
            if base_time.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(base_time):
                other = self._next_opening_time(base_time)
        elif n < 0:
            if base_time.time() in self.start:
                base_time = base_time - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(base_time):
                other = self._next_opening_time(base_time)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        business_hours_sec = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        business_hours_min = business_hours_sec // 60
        remainder = abs(n) % business_hours_min
        offset_minutes = remainder if n >= 0 else -remainder

        adjusted_time = base_time
        if n != 0:
            business_day_offset = BusinessDay(n=n)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(base_time):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(base_time)
                remain = base_time - prev_open
                adjusted_time = prev_open + business_day_offset + remain
            else:
                adjusted_time = base_time + business_day_offset

        adjusted_time += timedelta(minutes=offset_minutes)
        
        return adjusted_time
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases and produce the expected output datetime values.
