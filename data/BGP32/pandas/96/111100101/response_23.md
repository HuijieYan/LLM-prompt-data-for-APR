### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `apply` function arises due to incorrect handling of the input parameter `other`. The function is supposed to adjust the input `other` based on business hours and days, but the logic for adjusting the time is flawed. This results in incorrect output timestamps.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the logic where the function tries to adjust the input `other` based on the business hours and days. The incorrect calculations for adjusting the time lead to the incorrect output timestamps.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic for adjusting the time based on business hours and days. Specifically, the calculation for adjusting `other` when the `n` value is negative needs to be revised to ensure the correct output timestamps.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function with the bug fixed:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = other + skip_bd
    
            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = (
                        self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    )
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making these adjustments to the logic for adjusting the time, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output values.
