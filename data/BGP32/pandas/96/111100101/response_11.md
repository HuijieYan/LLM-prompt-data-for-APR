### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class and contains logic for adjusting datetime values based on business hours. The function is called with a datetime object `other` as a parameter and performs calculations to adjust the datetime based on the specified business hours.

The buggy function fails in scenarios where adjustments to the input datetime `other` need to be made to align with business hours, leading to incorrect output datetime values.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The bug occurs when adjusting `other` to align with business hours based on the provided custom business hours.
2. The logic to adjust `other` for positive values of `n` (number of business hours) is incorrect, resulting in `other` being adjusted incorrectly.
3. The bug leads to incorrect handling of business days and remaining business hours, causing the output datetime `other` to be calculated incorrectly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure correct adjustment of the input datetime `other` based on the specified custom business hours.
2. Verify the handling of positive and negative values of `n` to correctly adjust `other` to align with business hours.
3. Check the logic for adjusting remaining business hours after adjusting business days to ensure the final output datetime is correct.

### Updated/Copy Function:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        other = other.replace(hour=other.hour // 60, minute=other.minute, second=0, microsecond=0)
        
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd
        
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        
        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

The corrected function addresses the adjustment calculation logic for `other` based on custom business hours, handling both positive and negative values of `n` correctly to align the output datetime with the specified business time intervals.
