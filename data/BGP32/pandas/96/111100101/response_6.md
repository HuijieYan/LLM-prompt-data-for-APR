The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the calculation of business hours and the adjustment of the datetime based on the business hours. The function is not properly handling the cases where the adjustment of business hours results in a change of the date.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the function to correctly handle the cases where the adjustments cross over into the next or previous business day.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = other + skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            current_time = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond
            )

            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                next_opening_time = self._next_opening_time(current_time)
                closing_time = self._get_closing_time(next_opening_time)
                
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = closing_time - current_time
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        current_time += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        current_time = next_opening_time
                else:
                    bhour = next_opening_time - current_time
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        current_time += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        current_time = self._get_closing_time(next_opening_time - timedelta(seconds=1))

            return current_time
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should now handle the adjustments for business hours correctly and pass the failing test cases provided.
