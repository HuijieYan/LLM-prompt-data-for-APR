### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is designed to adjust the input datetime based on custom business hours. The function seems to have issues handling the logic for adjusting the datetime within the business hours and across multiple business days.

### Bug:
The bug is likely in the logic involving adjusting the datetime within the business hours, handling business days correctly, and ensuring the adjustments are made accurately based on the custom business hours.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the adjustment of the input datetime within the business hours is correctly handled.
2. Verify the logic for adjusting across multiple business days and ensure it's accurately implemented.
3. Check the conditions for moving to the next business day or previous business day and make sure they are appropriate.
4. Validate the adjustment of business hours remaining within the same business time interval.
5. Confirm the correct calculation for the total business hours in a day to make accurate adjustments.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = (self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other)
                    if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if (bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and getattr(other, 'nanosecond', 0) != 0)):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(
                                other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                            )
                        )

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

### The corrected version of the function should now handle the adjustments within the custom business hours and across multiple business days accurately, ensuring that the expected output values match the test cases.
