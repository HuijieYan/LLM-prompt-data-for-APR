### Bug Explanation
The buggy function is meant to adjust a given datetime object `other` based on the business hours defined by the `CustomBusinessHour` object. However, there are multiple bugs in the function that prevent it from working correctly. One major bug is related to handling negative values of `n`. When `n` is negative, the function should adjust `other` to the previous opening time before starting the adjustment. Additionally, there are issues with how the function updates `other` based on the remaining business hours and how it handles skipping business days.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Correct the adjustment logic for negative values of `n` to handle cases where `other` is already at the opening time.
2. Update the logic to correctly skip business days and adjust remaining business hours.
3. Fix any other logical errors in the function.

### Corrected Function
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
    
            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = skip_bd.rollforward(other)
    
            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    open_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    bhour = open_time - other
                else:
                    bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    if n >= 0:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                else:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the logic for negative `n` values, ensuring proper skipping of business days, and adjusting the remaining business hours correctly, the function should now work as expected and pass the failing test cases.
