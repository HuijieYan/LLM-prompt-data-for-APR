### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `apply` function is caused by incorrect handling of the input parameter `other` which is a `datetime` object. The function is resetting the timezone and nanosecond of the `other` object but not correctly handling the adjustment of business days and business hours. This leads to incorrect calculations and the function returns unexpected results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling business days and business hours in the `apply` function. We should ensure that the adjustments are done correctly based on the conditions provided in the function. Additionally, we need to make sure that the `other` datetime object is handled properly for both positive and negative `n` values and edge cases.

### Corrected Function:
```python
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            bdays = pd.offsets.BusinessDay(n=n)

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            other += bd * bdays

            while r != 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if r < bhour.total_seconds()//60:
                    other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                    break
                r -= bhour.total_seconds()//60
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

After applying the corrections to the `apply` function, it should now handle the adjustment of business days and business hours correctly based on the input parameters and return the expected results for each test case.
