### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `apply` function arises from the calculation of business hours and adjustment logic. The function is intended to adjust the given `other` date according to business hours defined by `self`. However, there are issues with the calculation of business hours, adjustment by days, and handling of remaining hours in the current implementation.

1. The calculation of `bd` (business days) and `r` (remaining time) is not handling negative values correctly.
2. The adjustment logic for business days (`skip_bd`) is not properly updating the `other` date.
3. The loop for adjusting remaining hours is not correctly comparing durations and updating the `other` date.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, you need to correct the calculation of business days and remaining time, adjust the logic for handling business days, and ensure the remaining hours are adjusted correctly within the business time intervals.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import ApplyTypeError, BusinessDay
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            on_offset = other.time() in self.start or other.time() in self.end or self._is_on_offset(other)

            if n >= 0:
                if not on_offset:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() == self.start[0]:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if on_offset:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd = -bd
                r = -r

            if bd != 0:
                adjusted_date = other
                
                if bd > 0:
                    for _ in range(bd):
                        adjusted_date = self.next_bday.rollforward(adjusted_date)
                else:
                    for _ in range(abs(bd)):
                        adjusted_date = self.next_bday.rollback(adjusted_date)

                other = adjusted_date

            while r != 0:
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if r < bhour.total_seconds() // 60:
                        other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                        r = 0
                    else:
                        r -= bhour.total_seconds() // 60
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other) + bhour
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if r > bhour.total_seconds() // 60 or (r == bhour.total_seconds() // 60 and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                        r = 0
                    else:
                        r -= bhour.total_seconds() // 60
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function incorporates the fixed logic for adjusting business days and remaining hours within the business time intervals, addressing the issues present in the original implementation.
