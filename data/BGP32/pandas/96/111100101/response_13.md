### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the provided function seems to be related to how adjustments are made for business days and business hours. The function is not handling the adjustments correctly, especially for negative values of `n` (number of business hours).

### Bug Cause:
1. In the case of negative `n`, the function is incorrectly adjusting the `other` time by moving it to the previous day and then adjusting it back to the next opening time and closing time. This approach is causing the function to return incorrect results for negative `n`.
2. The function is not properly handling the business day adjustments, leading to incorrect calculations and results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. For negative `n`, we need to adjust the `other` time by first moving it to the next business day's opening time and then adjusting the business hours from there.
2. Ensure correct handling of business day adjustments to accurately calculate the adjusted time based on the specified number of business hours.

### Corrected Function:
Based on the analysis and bug fix strategy, here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# Corrected version of the function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            # Adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                
                # Adjust by moving to the next business day
                other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                else:
                    bhour = other - self._next_opening_time(other)

                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    if n >= 0:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other) + bhour
                    else:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - bhour

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle the adjustments of business days and business hours accurately for both positive and negative values of `n`. It should pass the failing tests provided for different scenarios.
