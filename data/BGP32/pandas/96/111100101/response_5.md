### Bug analysis:
The buggy function `apply()` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is intended to adjust a given timestamp based on business hours specified by the class attributes. It encounters a bug that leads to incorrect adjustments and fails the provided test cases. The bug is likely related to incorrect calculations within the function while adjusting the timestamp based on the specified business hours.

### Bug location:
The bug seems to be located in the logic where the function adjusts the timestamp based on the business hours. There are multiple conditions and calculations involved in adjusting the timestamp which might be causing the incorrect output.

### Bug cause:
1. The adjustment for negative `n` values is not correctly handling the cases where the timestamp is on the starting time.
2. The calculations for `bhour_remain` and adjusting the timestamp in both positive and negative `n` cases may not be accurate, leading to incorrect adjustments.

### Bug fix strategy:
1. Review and adjust the logic for handling negative `n` values and timestamp adjustments accordingly.
2. Ensure that the calculations for business hour adjustments and remaining time are accurate to correctly adjust the timestamp.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        
        # Adjust the timezone and nanosecond components
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0)
        
        # Adjust other based on business hours
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        # Calculate total business hours in a day
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        
        # Calculate business days adjustment
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd
        
        # Adjust remaining business hours
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        
        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other - timedelta(seconds=1)))
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With this corrected version of the `apply()` function, it should now accurately adjust the timestamp based on the specified business hours and pass the failing test cases provided.
