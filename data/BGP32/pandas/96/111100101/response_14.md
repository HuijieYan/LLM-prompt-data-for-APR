## Bug Explanation
The buggy function `apply` is not correctly adjusting the business hours based on the input parameters, leading to incorrect output values. The logic for adjusting the business hours is faulty, which results in the function returning incorrect timestamps.

The main issues in the buggy function are:
1. Incorrect adjustment of the input `other` timestamp, causing it to miss the correct business hour intervals.
2. Incorrect calculation of the remaining business hours to adjust, leading to incorrect iteration through the business time intervals.
3. Mistakes in the conditionals for handling positive and negative values of `n`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the adjustment logic for the input timestamp, properly calculate the remaining business hours to adjust, and ensure the correct iteration through business time intervals. Also, we need to fix the conditionals for handling positive and negative values of `n`.

## Corrected Code
```python
# Import necessary libraries
import datetime
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
from pandas._libs.tslibs.timestamps import Timestamp
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime.datetime):
            n = self.n
            businesshours = sum((e.hour * 60 + e.minute) - (s.hour * 60 + s.minute) for s, e in zip(self.start, self.end))
            
            if n >= 0:
                while n:
                    other += datetime.timedelta(minutes=1)
                    if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                        n -= 1
            else:
                while n:
                    other -= datetime.timedelta(minutes=1)
                    if other.time() in self.start or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                        n += 1
            
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            other_start = other.replace(hour=self.start[0].hour, minute=self.start[0].minute)
            
            while bd < 0:
                other_start -= datetime.timedelta(days=1)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other_start):
                    other_start = self.next_bday._next_opening_time(other_start)
                bd += 1
            
            other = other_start + datetime.timedelta(minutes=r)
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

I have restructured the adjustment logic for better accuracy and fixed the issues with handling positive and negative `n` values. This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and return the expected output values.
