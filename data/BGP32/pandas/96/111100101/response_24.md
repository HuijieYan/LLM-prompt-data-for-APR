### Bug:
The buggy function `apply` is not correctly adjusting the input datetime based on the specified business hours and holidays. As a result, it is failing to return the expected output in certain cases, leading to the failing test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the specified business hours and holidays are properly considered when adjusting the input datetime.
2. Check the logic for handling positive and negative offsets to make sure the adjustment is accurate.
3. Verify that the calculation of business hours and the logic for adjusting by business days are functioning correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            other = datetime(
                year=other.year,
                month=other.month,
                day=other.day,
                hour=other.hour,
                minute=other.minute,
                second=other.second,
                microsecond=other.microsecond,
            )
    
            # adjust other based on business hours and holidays
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            # calculate business hours in a day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            # adjust by business days first
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd
    
            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By implementing the corrections outlined above, the function should now handle the adjustment of the input datetime based on specified business hours and holidays, ensuring that it returns the expected output for the given test cases.
