## Bug Analysis
The buggy function is designed to adjust a given datetime based on a custom business hour setting. It calculates the business hours, adjusts the datetime based on the business days, and then adjusts the remaining business hours.

The bug seems to be related to the adjustment of business days and remaining business hours. It fails to correctly handle cases where adjustments need to be made to move to the next business day or when calculating the remaining business hours.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to review the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours within the function. We should ensure that the adjustments are correctly calculated and that the datetime is properly updated based on the business constraints.

            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace

                            )
                        )
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After fixing the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and correctly adjust the given datetime based on the custom business hour settings.
