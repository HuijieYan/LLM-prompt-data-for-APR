### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is intended to adjust a given datetime object based on the business hours specified by the `CustomBusinessHour` class. In the failing test case, the function is unable to correctly adjust the input datetime object, resulting in incorrect output.

After analyzing the code, the following issues were identified:
1. Incorrect adjustment of the `other` variable when `n >= 0` or `n < 0` based on business hours.
2. Incorrect calculation of business hours in one business day.
3. Incorrect handling of cases when adjusting by business days.
4. Incorrect calculation of remaining business hours to adjust.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the issue, we need to correct the logic for adjusting the input datetime object based on business hours, business days, and remaining hours. The adjustments should be made considering the specified business hours in a day, the number of business days to skip, and the remaining hours to adjust within a business day.

### Updated Corrected Function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if (bhour_remain > bhour) or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying the corrections, the function should now correctly adjust the input datetime object based on the specified business hours, business days, and remaining hours. This updated version of the function should pass the failing test cases and produce the expected output.
