### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class within the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is supposed to perform business hour arithmetic adjustments on datetime inputs. The function tries to handle different cases based on the input datetime and various properties set in the `CustomBusinessHour` objects.

The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` tests the behavior of date range generation with custom business hours and holidays. The `CustomBusinessHour` class is set up to represent business hours with a specified start time and holidays.

The error arises when the function doesn't provide the expected values in the test case, causing a validation error due to an incorrect inferred frequency.

### Bug:
The bug in the `apply` function stems from incorrect handling of business hours and day adjustment calculations. This leads to the function not returning the expected output, causing validation errors in related tests.

The primary cause of this bug seems to be the inaccurate handling of the adjustment of the input datetime `other` based on the specified business hours and holidays.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Properly adjust the given datetime `other` based on the CustomBusinessHour settings and special conditions like holidays.
2. Ensure the adjustment logic correctly handles both positive and negative offset values for business hours.
3. Verify the calculation of business days and remaining business hours is accurate.
4. Address the transition between different business day intervals appropriately.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function in the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        other = other.replace(second=0, microsecond=0)  # Reset seconds and microseconds
        
        # Adjust the input datetime based on CustomBusinessHour settings
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)  # Move to the previous business day
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
            
        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)  # Remaining business hours to adjust
        
        # Adjust the remaining business hours
        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and other.nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should now handle the business hour adjustments correctly and pass the failing test scenarios provided.
