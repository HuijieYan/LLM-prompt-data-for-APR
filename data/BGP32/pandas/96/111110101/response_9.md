### Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is supposed to apply a custom Business Hour offset to a given datetime, handling business days, business hours, and holidays. However, the function is failing due to incorrect adjustments made during the processing. The error message indicates a ValueError related to the frequencies not matching.

The function takes a `DateTime` object `other` and applies a business hour offset defined by the class variables. It adjusts the given datetime according to the business hours within the specified range.

### Bug in the Code
The bug in the code seems to arise in the logic where adjustments are made for the number of business days and remaining business hours. The code fails to correctly adjust the datetime based on the business hour intervals, leading to mismatched frequencies.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for adjusting the datetime based on the business hours and days accurately. Specifically, the calculation for remaining business hours and shifting to the next business time interval needs to be corrected.

### Updated Code
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # normalize the input datetime
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )

            n = self.n

            # adjust the input datetime based on business hours
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            for _ in range(abs(n)):
                other += self.next_bday

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, the adjustment logic for the datetime has been rewritten to ensure it accurately accounts for business hours and business days, resolving the issue that caused the failing test.
