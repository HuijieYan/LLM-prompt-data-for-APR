### Analysis:
1. The `apply` method in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is meant to adjust the timestamp based on business hours defined by the `CustomBusinessHour` offset. 
2. The bug seems to arise from improper adjustments to the input `other` timestamp, leading to incorrect results.
3. The failing test is trying to create a date range with custom business hours starting at 15:00 and excluding a holiday on 2020-11-26. The buggy function is expected to adjust the timestamps accordingly, but it produces incorrect results leading to a validation error.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments made to the `other` timestamp are accurate based on the business hours defined by `CustomBusinessHour` and handle holidays correctly.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other to reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
    
            # adjust other timestamp based on business hours
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            # calculate total business hours in a day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = skip_bd.rollback(other)
    
            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    if n >= 0:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                    else:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(other + bhour)
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the business hour calculations and handling the adjustments to the `other` timestamp correctly, the corrected function should now provide the desired results and pass the failing test cases.
