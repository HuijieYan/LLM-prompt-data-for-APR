### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class and is used to adjust the datetime object based on business hours specified. The bug occurs in the logic for adjusting the datetime object to the next business day or time based on the business hours specified.

The error message indicates a failure in the validation of the frequency when generating the date range. This failure is likely due to incorrect adjustments made by the `apply` function that result in datetime values not conforming to the expected frequency for the `CustomBusinessHour` object.

### Bug Location
The bug occurs when adjusting the input datetime object within the `apply` function based on the business hours specified. The adjustments made are supposed to move the datetime object to the next business day or time, but the logic is flawed, causing the function to return incorrect values that lead to a failure in the frequency validation.

### Bug Cause
The main cause of the bug is the incorrect adjustment of the input datetime object within the `apply` function. The reasoning for moving the datetime object to the next business day or time is not correctly implemented, causing the function to return incorrect datetime values that do not conform to the expected frequency.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments made to the input datetime object within the `apply` function are correct and result in datetime values that conform to the expected frequency for the `CustomBusinessHour` object. The adjustments should account for business hours, business days, and any edge cases that may arise.

### Updated Buggy Function
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the apply function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        if n > 0:
            if other.time() in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        elif n < 0:
            if other.time() in self.end:
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            else:
                other = self._prev_opening_time(self._get_closing_time(other))

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                other = skip_bd.rollforward(other)
            else:
                other = skip_bd.on_offset(other)

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            prev_open_time = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            next_open_time = self._next_opening_time(other + timedelta(minutes=1))
            bhour = next_open_time - other

            if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = next_open_time
            else:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making the adjustments based on business hours and days more accurately, the corrected function should now generate datetime values that conform to the expected frequency for the `CustomBusinessHour` object. This should resolve the frequency validation error encountered in the failing test.
