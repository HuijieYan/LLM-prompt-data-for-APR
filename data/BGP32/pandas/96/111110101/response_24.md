### Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is a part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas` library. It is used to apply a `CustomBusinessHour` offset to a given datetime, adjusting it to the next business hour based on specified business hours and holidays.

The error encountered in the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` indicates a failure in the frequency validation of the resulting DatetimeIndex based on the given offset. This error is a consequence of incorrect adjustments made in the `apply` function. The function fails to properly identify and apply the correct business hours, leading to unexpected results.

### Issues in the Buggy Function
1. Incorrect handling of the given `other` datetime, especially regarding adjustments if `n` is negative.
2. Inadequate management of business days and business hours adjustments within the loop.
3. Misinterpretation of business hours based on the given business day settings.
4. Possible discrepancies in the logic around opening/closing times and offset validation.

### Bug Fixing Strategy
1. Ensure correct adjustments are made to the input datetime based on the given offset and business hour settings.
2. Validate the application of business hours, business days, and holiday considerations.
3. Address any discrepancies in opening/closing times and validate the offset appropriately.

### Bug Fix

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour

class CustomBusinessHour(CustomBusinessHour):
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            adjusted_dt = other
            if n >= 0:
                if adjusted_dt.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(adjusted_dt):
                    adjusted_dt = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_dt)
            else:
                if adjusted_dt.time() in self.start:
                    adjusted_dt -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self.is_on_offset(adjusted_dt):
                    adjusted_dt = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_dt)
                    adjusted_dt = self._get_closing_time(adjusted_dt)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                unique_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not unique_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_dt)
                    remain = adjusted_dt - prev_open
                    adjusted_dt = prev_open + unique_bd + remain
                else:
                    adjusted_dt = adjusted_dt + unique_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_dt)) - adjusted_dt
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_dt) - adjusted_dt
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    adjusted_dt += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    if n < 0:
                        adjusted_dt = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(adjusted_dt + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
                    else:
                        adjusted_dt = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_dt + bhour)
    
            return adjusted_dt
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making sure the adjustments are correctly handled within the apply function, the corrected version should now pass the failing test with the expected input/output values.
