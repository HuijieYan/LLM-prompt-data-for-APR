### Bug Explanation:
The bug lies in the `apply` method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The method is designed to adjust a given datetime object based on business hours defined by the class attributes. However, the bug causes incorrect adjustments leading to failures in tests involving custom business hours.

The main issue seems to be with the calculation of business days (`bd`) and remaining business hours (`r`). The incorrect adjustment logic causes the method to inaccurately calculate and adjust the datetime object, resulting in mismatched expected values.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Review the logic within the method to ensure proper calculations for adjusting the datetime object based on business hours and days.
2. Pay close attention to how business days are handled, ensuring correct addition or subtraction of days as needed.
3. Verify the adjustment of remaining business hours to accurately adjust the datetime object within the business hours' constraints.

### Corrected Function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other) if n >= 0 else self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the adjustment logic within the `apply` method, it should now properly adjust the datetime object based on the defined business hours and days, resolving the bug. This correction should enable the failing test to pass successfully.
