### Strategy for fixing the bug:
The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of business days and hours within the `apply` function. To fix this bug, we need to adjust how the function calculates and adjusts the business days and hours properly.

1. Update the conditions and adjustments for handling positive and negative business days.
2. Ensure that the adjustments for remaining business hours are correctly calculated and applied.
3. Verify that the calculated business hours and days match the expected values.
4. Correctly handle edge cases and special conditions related to holiday adjustments.

### Corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = other + skip_bd
        
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                else:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By incorporating the corrections outlined above, the fixed version of the `apply` function should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output values.
