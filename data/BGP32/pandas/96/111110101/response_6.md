### Analysis
1. The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is the source of the error.
2. The function is designed to adjust a given datetime object based on business hours and holidays.
3. The bug seems to be related to incorrect adjustments and calculations inside the function that result in unexpected behavior.
4. The error message implies a failure in validating the frequency, which indicates a mismatch in expectations.
5. We need to ensure that the adjustments made in the function align with the expected business hours and holidays to fix the bug.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by incorrect adjustments and calculations within the `apply` function, leading to unexpected behavior and validation failures when using custom business hours with holidays.

The function should correctly adjust the input datetime object based on the specified business hours and holidays to produce the expected output.

### Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that the adjustments made to the input datetime object consider the start and end times of business hours, as well as holidays.
2. Make sure that the calculated values for business days, remaining hours, and adjustments are in line with the expected behavior.
3. Validate the adjustments and ensure they result in a datetime object that satisfies the given business rules and holidays.

### Corrected Function
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

            if self.start <= other.time() < self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            total_minutes = abs(self.n) * 60
            bd, r = divmod(total_minutes, businesshours // 60)

            if self.n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if self.n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + timedelta(seconds=1))
            else:
                while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function should align the adjustments and calculations with the expected behavior, taking into account the specified business hours and holidays.
