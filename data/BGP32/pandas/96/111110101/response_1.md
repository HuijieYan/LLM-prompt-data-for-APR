### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is supposed to adjust the input datetime object according to the `CustomBusinessHour` object. However, the function fails to properly handle the adjustment in certain cases, leading to incorrect output. The failing test specifices the expected behavior for the `CustomBusinessHour` object with custom holidays, which the buggy function is supposed to handle.

The main issues in the buggy function are related to the adjustment of the input datetime object and the calculation of business hours. The function reaches incorrect states due to miscalculations in the adjustment steps.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the adjustments in the `apply` function need to be corrected to handle the custom business hour properly and adjust the datetime object in accordance with the desired behavior. Specifically, adjusting for business days and remaining business hours needs to be accurately calculated. 

The error handling for raising `ApplyTypeError` with an appropriate message when the input is not an instance of datetime will be retained.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if not isinstance(other, Timestamp):
            other = Timestamp(other)

        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = other.replace(hour=self.start[0].hour, minute=self.start[0].minute)
                    other = self.next_offset(other)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self.next_offset(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and other.nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = other.replace(hour=self.start[0].hour, minute=self.start[0].minute)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the adjustment steps and handling the calculation of business hours more accurately, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases.
