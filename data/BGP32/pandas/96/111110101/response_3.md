### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is a method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which contains several helper functions needed by the `apply` method.
2. The failing test involves creating a `date_range` with a custom business hour frequency, which uses the `CustomBusinessHour` object.
3. The error message indicates a `ValueError` raised during the validation of the frequency, indicating an issue with frequency validation for a `DatetimeIndex` with custom business hours.
4. The failing test expects certain timestamps with the custom business hours frequency to be generated correctly using the `apply` function.

### Issues:
1. The `@apply_wraps` decorator might not be functioning correctly due to missing details.
2. The logic within the `apply` method related to adjusting dates and business hours might not be handling custom business hours correctly.
3. The handling of business days and business hours adjustment needs to be reviewed.
4. The `IndexError` might indicate an incorrect calculation or handling of business hours within the method.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the `@apply_wraps` decorator functions correctly by providing the necessary details.
2. Review the logic related to adjusting dates and business hours to handle custom business hours properly.
3. Check the handling of business days and hours to ensure accurate adjustment.
4. Debug and correct any indexing errors or issues in the processing of business hours.

### Fixed Version of the `apply` Method:
```python
    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

This corrected version of the `apply` method should address the issues identified and pass the failing test case.
