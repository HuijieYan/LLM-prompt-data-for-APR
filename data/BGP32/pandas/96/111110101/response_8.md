### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs in the `apply` method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The method fails to properly adjust the provided timestamp based on the business hours specified. This results in incorrect calculations that lead to the failure of the test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.

#### Bug Description
The bug stems from incorrect adjustments made to the input `other` timestamp within the `apply` method. The method tries to calculate the next opening time, adjust for business days, and calculate remaining business hours, but the logic is flawed and does not produce the expected output. This leads to incorrect timestamps being returned.

#### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments made to the `other` timestamp are correct and align with the business hours defined. Proper handling of positive and negative business hour offsets is essential. Additionally, adjustments related to business days and remaining business hours need to be accurate. 

### Bug Fix and Corrected Code
After a careful analysis of the bug, the following corrected version of the `apply` method in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is provided below:

```python
# Corrected version of the apply method
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        bd = divmod(abs(n), len(self)) * (-1 if n < 0 else 1)
        
        if bd != 0:
            other = self.next_bday.rollforward(other + timedelta(days=bd))

        remaining_minutes = n % len(self) * 60
        while remaining_minutes != 0:
            current_hour = other.hour
            current_minute = other.minute
            current_seconds = current_hour * 3600 + current_minute * 60
            if n >= 0:
                closing_time = self._get_closing_time(other)
                time_to_closing = (closing_time - other).total_seconds() / 60
                if time_to_closing < remaining_minutes:
                    remaining_minutes -= time_to_closing
                    other = self._next_opening_time(closing_time)
                else:
                    other += timedelta(minutes=remaining_minutes)
                    remaining_minutes = 0
            else:
                opening_time = self._next_opening_time(other.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0))
                time_to_opening = (opening_time - other).total_seconds() / 60
                if time_to_opening > abs(remaining_minutes):
                    other += timedelta(minutes=remaining_minutes)
                    remaining_minutes = 0
                else:
                    remaining_minutes += time_to_opening
                    other = self._get_closing_time(opening_time - timedelta(seconds=1))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected code provides appropriate adjustments for positive and negative business hours, business days, and remaining minutes within the given business hours. This fix should resolve the bug and ensure that the test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` passes successfully.
