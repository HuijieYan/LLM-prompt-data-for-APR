### Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class and is used to apply custom business hours to a given datetime. The function seems to be incorrectly adjusting the datetime based on the custom business hours defined.

Based on the failing test and the error message, it seems that the function is not adjusting the business hours correctly for custom business hours starting at 15:00. This is causing an error related to frequency validation, as the adjusted datetime does not conform to the expected frequency.

The expected input parameters for the function involve a `Timestamp` object, custom business hours defined in the `CustomBusinessHour` class, and other related parameters like start and end times for the business hours.

### Bug
The bug seems to be related to how the function is adjusting the given datetime with respect to the defined custom business hours. The calculations for adjusting the datetime based on business days and the remaining business hours seem to be incorrect, leading to the validation error seen in the failing test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Ensure that adjustments made to the datetime based on the custom business hours are correct.
2. Verify that the calculation of business days and remaining business hours is accurate.
3. Make sure that the adjusted datetime conforms to the specified frequency.

### Code Fix

Here is a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            
            adjusted_time = other.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
            
            if n >= 0:
                while n > 0:
                    adjusted_time = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_time)
                    n -= 1
            else:
                while n < 0:
                    adjusted_time = self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_time)
                    n += 1
                
            return adjusted_time.replace(hour=other.hour, minute=other.minute, second=other.second, microsecond=other.microsecond)
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version focuses on properly adjusting the given datetime based on the custom business hours provided. It handles the increment or decrement of business days correctly and ensures that the adjusted time is returned with the original time components. This should resolve the issue seen in the failing test and the related error message.
