### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class and is designed to handle business hours offset adjustments using the provided business rules. The error message from the failing test indicates a failure in the custom business hour frequency generation, suggesting an issue within the `apply` function implementation.

The function takes a `datetime` object `other` as input and adjusts it based on the custom business hours defined by the class instance. The function iterates through the business hours to calculate the adjusted time. The bug likely resides in how the adjustments are made, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Evaluate the adjustment logic to ensure it correctly handles positive and negative business hour offsets.
2. Check the boundary conditions (start and end times in business hours) to avoid infinite loops or incorrect adjustments.
3. Verify the adjustment process considering business days and business hours correctly.
4. Review the handling of different cases based on the offset value (`n`) to ensure consistent adjustments.

### Corrected Function
After analyzing the bug and considering the expected input/output values, below is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
            
            if bd != 0:
                other += bd * CustomBusinessDay()
                
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and other.nanosecond != 0):
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other += bhour
                    else:
                        break
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By applying the logic modifications as specified above, the corrected `apply` function should now handle the business hour adjustments correctly, passing the failing test cases with the expected input/output values.
