## Bug Analysis
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is intended to handle adjustments to timestamps based on business hours. However, it fails to handle certain edge cases, leading to incorrect outputs.
2. The error in the function arises when adjusting the timestamps based on given business hours, resulting in incorrect final timestamps.
3. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` shows that the adjusted timestamps are not correct according to the specified business hours, leading to a `ValueError` in the test execution.
4. To fix the bug, adjustments need to be made in handling the business hours and days correctly to ensure that the resulting timestamp aligns with the rules defined by the `CustomBusinessHour` class.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug in the `apply` function, several adjustments need to be made to ensure that the timestamp adjustments align correctly with the specified business hours. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import ApplyTypeError
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BaseOffset
from datetime import time, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            
            n = self.n
            
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            business_hours_per_day = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            
            num_days, remaining_minutes = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours_per_day // 60)
            if n < 0:
                num_days, remaining_minutes = -num_days, -remaining_minutes
            
            if num_days != 0:
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + BusinessDay(n=num_days) + remain
                else:
                    other = other + BusinessDay(n=num_days)
            
            remaining_delta = timedelta(minutes=remaining_minutes)
            
            while remaining_delta != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    remaining_business_time = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if remaining_business_time >= remaining_delta:
                        other += remaining_delta
                        remaining_delta = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        remaining_delta -= remaining_business_time
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other) + timedelta(days=1)
                else:
                    remaining_business_time = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if remaining_business_time > remaining_delta or (remaining_business_time == remaining_delta and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += remaining_delta
                        remaining_delta = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        remaining_delta -= remaining_business_time
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1))
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making these adjustments in the function, we ensure that the timestamp adjustments are correctly aligned with the specified business hours, fixing the bug identified in the initial implementation.
