### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is not correctly handling the adjustment of business days and business hours when applying a custom business hour offset. This leads to incorrect calculations for moving the timestamp to the next business hour. The main issue lies in the logic that adjusts the timestamps by business days and then by remaining business hours.

### Bug Explanation:
1. When the `n` value is positive, the function tries to adjust the timestamp to the next opening time. However, the logic for adjusting the timestamp by business days is incorrect, leading to an incorrect final result.
  
2. When the `n` value is negative, the function tries to adjust the timestamp to the previous business day and then tries to move it to the next opening time. Similar issues with business day adjustment lead to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `apply` function, we need to correct the logic for adjusting the timestamp by business days and business hours. We need to handle the cases when `n` is both positive and negative properly to ensure the correct adjustment of the timestamp.

### Updated Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function that addresses the issues mentioned above:
```python
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            # Check if the timestamp is within business hours, adjust if needed
            if other.time() not in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # Calculate total business hours in one business day
            business_hours_per_day = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                                         for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

            # Calculate business days and remaining business hours
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n) * 60, business_hours_per_day // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            timestamp = other

            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                business_day_offset = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
                timestamp = business_day_offset.apply(other)

            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            remaining_business_hours = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                # Forward adjustment
                while remaining_business_hours.total_seconds() > 0:
                    timestamp = self._next_opening_time(timestamp)
                    business_hour_diff = self._get_closing_time(timestamp) - timestamp
                    if business_hour_diff >= remaining_business_hours:
                        timestamp += remaining_business_hours
                        break
                    else:
                        remaining_business_hours -= business_hour_diff
            else:
                # Backward adjustment
                while remaining_business_hours.total_seconds() < 0:
                    timestamp = self._prev_opening_time(timestamp)
                    business_hour_diff = timestamp - self._prev_opening_time(timestamp)
                    if business_hour_diff >= abs(remaining_business_hours):
                        timestamp -= abs(remaining_business_hours)
                        break
                    else:
                        remaining_business_hours += business_hour_diff

            return timestamp
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By implementing the corrected logic as shown above, the `apply` function should now properly adjust the timestamps based on the custom business hour offset.
