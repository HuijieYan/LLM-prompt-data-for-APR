## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is a method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. It is designed to adjust a given datetime object based on business hours defined by the instance of `CustomBusinessHour` created by the user. The function has an issue that leads to failing the test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.

The error message from the failing test indicates an issue with the validation of the frequency, specifically related to the `CustomBusinessHour` offset. This suggests that the problematic part may be in how the frequency information is handled within the `apply` function.

### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `apply` is failing because it is not handling the frequency offset `CustomBusinessHour` correctly when adjusting the input datetime object. This results in an incorrect output datetime object that does not conform to the defined frequency, causing the validation to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments performed on the input datetime object align with the specified business hours defined by the `CustomBusinessHour` offset. Additionally, the adjustments should maintain the correct frequency information to pass the validation check.

## Bug-fixed Code
```python
# Import necessary classes and libraries
from pandas.tseries.offsets import ApplyTypeError, CustomBusinessHour
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Fix the buggy function 'apply'
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):        
        n = self.n
        start = self.start[0]
        end = self.end[0]

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() > end or other.time() < start:
                next_opening_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
                if next_opening_time.time() == start:
                    other = next_opening_time
                else:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(next_opening_time)
        else:
            if other.time() == start:
                other = other - timedelta(hours=1)
            else:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        diff_seconds = abs(n * 60 * 60)
        bd = diff_seconds // (end.hour - start.hour)
        r = diff_seconds % (end.hour - start.hour)

        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = CustomBusinessHour(n=bd)
            other = other + skip_bd
        
        other += timedelta(minutes=r)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the logic in the `apply` function and ensuring that the adjustments are aligned with the specified business hours, we can fix the bug and pass the failing test case.
