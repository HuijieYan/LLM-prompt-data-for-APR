### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is designed to adjust a timestamp based on a set of business hours defined in the `CustomBusinessHour` class. The logic of the function involves adjusting the timestamp according to business hours, business days, and handling edge conditions.

The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` aims to create a date range with custom business hours, specifically starting from "2020-11-25 15:00" for 4 periods with a custom business frequency set from 3 pm to 5 pm and a holiday on "2020-11-26". However, the test fails with a `ValueError` related to frequency validation.

### Bug Explanation
The bug lies in the `apply` function's logic of adjusting the timestamp according to business hours. The error occurs due to an incorrect check within the function, leading to unexpected adjustments resulting in a frequency validation error during the test.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Ensure the timestamp adjustments follow the defined business hours correctly.
2. Adjust the timestamp according to the frequency specified.
3. Validate and handle any edge cases properly to prevent errors.

### Corrected Function
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import ApplyTypeError
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessHourMixin

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, pd.Timestamp):
            n = self.n
            other = other.floor("T")  # floor the timestamp to minute level
            
            # Adjust for business hours and days
            for _ in range(abs(n)):
                if n > 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected function:
- The timestamp is floored to the minute level to avoid nanoseconds discrepancy.
- Adjustments are made for business hours and days based on the specified conditions.
- The timestamp is returned after adjustments.

This corrected function should now handle the adjustments correctly, passing the failing test and meeting the expected input/output values.
