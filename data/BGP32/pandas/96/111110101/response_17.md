### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is supposed to adjust a given timestamp by a custom business hour frequency. The bug seems to be related to how the adjustment for business hours is calculated. It fails in the test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` when trying to generate a `DatetimeIndex` with a frequency that does not match the inferred frequency.

### Bug Explanation
1. The bug arises due to incorrect calculations of business days and hours in the code.
2. In particular, the adjustment of `bd` (business days) and `r` (remaining business hours) based on the time intervals between `start` and `end` is flawed, leading to incorrect time adjustments.
3. This leads to mismatches in the adjusted timestamps, causing failures when creating a `DatetimeIndex`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Fix the calculation of `bd` and `r` to accurately reflect the number of business days and remaining hours.
2. Ensure correct handling of the adjustment for both positive and negative values of `n` (number of custom business hours).

### Updated Buggy Function
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)

        if bd != 0:
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying these fixes, the updated function should correctly adjust timestamps by the custom business hour frequency and pass the failing test case.
