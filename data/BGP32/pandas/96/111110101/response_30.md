### Explanation:
The buggy function `apply` is intended to adjust a given datetime based on a set of business hours and additional rules. The function is failing to properly handle the adjustment logic, leading to incorrect results.

The error message indicates a `ValueError` is raised during the test execution. This error is due to the fact that the inferred frequency of the DatetimeIndex does not conform to the passed frequency (CustomBusinessHour in this case). This shows that the adjustment made by the function is not correct, leading to an invalid frequency in the resulting DatetimeIndex.

### Bug:
The bug in the function is likely related to the adjustment made based on business hours and days. Incorrect calculation or handling of business days/hours is causing the function to produce incorrect results.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the adjustment of the given datetime is correctly based on the business hours and days specified.
2. Carefully handle cases where the adjustment passes upper or lower limits related to business hours.
3. Verify the logic for adjusting business days is proper.
4. Check the calculation of business hours remaining for adjustment.

### Updated Function:
Here is a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = self.next_bday.rollforward(other) + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours adjustment
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                other += bhour
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With these corrections in place, the function should now perform the intended adjustment correctly and pass the failing test case provided.
