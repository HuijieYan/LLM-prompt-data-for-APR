### Bug Analysis:
- The bug seems to be related to how the `CustomBusinessHour` offset is applied when generating a date range.
- The error message indicates a failure in frequency validation, specifically related to the inferred frequency not matching the passed frequency.
- The function under examination is the `apply` method within the `BusinessHourMixin` class.
- The function is supposed to adjust the given datetime based on the CustomBusinessHour offset, but there are issues in the adjustment logic leading to incorrect outputs.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Check the logic for adjusting the datetime based on the CustomBusinessHour offset.
- Ensure that the adjustments are correctly applied to align with the business hours specified in the offset.
- Address the issues related to negative business hours, handling holidays, and moving to the next business day correctly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            
            # Adjust other to reduce the number of cases to handle
            other = other.replace(hour=self.start[0].hour, minute=self.start[0].minute, second=0, microsecond=0)
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() >= self.end[0] or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() <= self.start[0]:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            # Get total business hours in a day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

Applying this corrected function should ensure that the adjustments based on the CustomBusinessHour offset are made correctly, aligning with the expected business hours for each case.
