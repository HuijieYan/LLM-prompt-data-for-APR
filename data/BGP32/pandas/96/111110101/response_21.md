### Strategy for fixing the bug
The bug seems to be related to the calculation of business days, business hours, and adjustments of the given timestamp. The corrected version should address the issues related to these calculations to ensure the correct adjustment of the timestamp according to the defined business hours.

1. Ensure that the adjustments and calculations related to business days and business hours are correctly handled in both positive and negative scenarios.
2. Check the logic for adjusting the timestamps during the calculation to make sure it aligns with the business hours definition.
3. Verify the handling of edge cases where the timestamp may fall outside the defined business hours.
4. Ensure that the final return value is adjusted correctly based on the calculated business days and business hours.

Let's provide a corrected version of the buggy function based on the identified strategy. 

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)  # Move to next business time interval
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                    else:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))  # Move to next business time interval
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                    else:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should address the issues leading to the original bug and ensure that the function works correctly according to the defined business hours and adjustments. Feel free to test this corrected version with the failing test to verify its functionality.
