### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `apply` is supposed to calculate the next business time based on the provided business hour offset. However, there are issues in the calculation logic that lead to incorrect results, causing the failing test case.

The key issues in the buggy function are:
1. Incorrect handling of adjustments for negative business hours.
2. Incorrect updates of the `other` variable after adjusting business days.
3. Errors in adjusting remaining business hours within a business time interval.

These issues result in incorrect timestamp calculations that deviate from the expected business hours behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `apply` function, the following steps can be taken:
1. Ensure proper handling of adjustments for negative business hours.
2. Correctly update the `other` variable after adjusting business days.
3. Fix the remaining business hours adjustment logic within a business time interval.

By addressing these issues, the corrected function should return the expected business hours based on the offset provided.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # Existing code...

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(minutes=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other += skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                else:
                    bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By applying the fixes mentioned above, the corrected function should pass the failing test cases and return the expected business hours based on the provided offset.
