### Analysis
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is intended to calculate the next business time based on a given timestamp, taking into account business hours and specific conditions. The failing test is related to a custom business hour frequency that includes holidays.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that the custom business hours and holidays are correctly handled.
2. Check the edge conditions for moving to the next business time and adjust the calculations accordingly.
3. Fix any discrepancies in handling negative and positive business time adjustments. 

### Bug Fix

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() == self.start[0] or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    if self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday._is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function should now properly handle custom business hour frequencies that include holidays and pass the failing test cases.
