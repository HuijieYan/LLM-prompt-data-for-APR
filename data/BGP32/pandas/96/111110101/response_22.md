### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the file `pandas/tseries/offsets.py`. The function has several conditional checks and operations related to business hours, adjusting time based on business days, and calculating business hours by seconds.

From the failing test and the error message, it is evident that the buggy function is not correctly handling adjustments for Custom Business Hours. This leads to an error in comparing frequencies during the test run, ultimately resulting in a `ValueError`.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug in the `apply` function seems to be related to the incorrect handling of timestamp adjustments based on Custom Business Hours. The logic for adjusting the timestamp, business days, and business hours appears to have inconsistencies, leading to the failure of the test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the adjustments made to timestamps and business days are correctly aligned with the Custom Business Hours.
2. Verify the logic for handling positive and negative hour adjustments to guarantee the correct output.
3. Check the calculations for business days and business hours to ensure the accurate calculation of intervals.
4. Validate the comparisons and adjustments made during the iterations to fulfill the expected output and pass the failing tests.

### Updated Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function that addresses the identified issues:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BaseOffset

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
    
            # adjust other based on Custom Business Hours
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            # calculate total business hours
            businesshours per day
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
    
            # adjust by business days first
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd
    
            # adjust remaining business hours
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function should address the identified issues, pass the failing test, and satisfy the expected input/output values for different scenarios.
