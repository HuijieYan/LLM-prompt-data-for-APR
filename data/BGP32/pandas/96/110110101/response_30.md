The buggy function is failing because it is not correctly handling the adjustment of business hours in custom scenarios, resulting in an incorrect output that does not match the expected values. The key issue lies in the logic used to adjust the time intervals based on business hours and offsets.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the calculation and adjustment of business hours within the function. Specifically, we need to ensure that the adjustments for positive and negative values of `n` work correctly to move the timestamp to the next or previous business day, if needed, and adjust the remaining hours accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            current_time = other.time()
            
            # Adjust the timestamp based on the business hours
            if n >= 0:
                # Move to the next opening time if the current time is not part of the business hours
                if current_time not in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
               
            else:
                # Move to the previous business day opening time if needed
                if current_time in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(days=1)
                    
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            # Calculate the total business hours in one day
            business_hours_per_day = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            
            # Calculate the adjustment based on positive or negative n
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours_per_day // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
                
            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
                    
            # Adjust the remaining business hours
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                else:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the logic for moving to opening times, applying adjustments based on `n`, and handling remaining business hours correctly, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and return the expected output.
