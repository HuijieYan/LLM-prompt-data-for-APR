### Analysis
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is attempting to adjust a given datetime instance based on business hours.
2. The function tries to handle different cases for positive and negative business hours, adjusting the input datetime accordingly.
3. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` checks the behavior of custom business hours with holiday constraints and expects specific datetime values in the result.
4. The error occurs during the test due to a discrepancy in the inferred frequency from the passed values.
5. The bug may be related to improper adjustments or handling of business hours within the function.

### Bug Cause
The buggy function fails to properly adjust the input datetime instance based on the provided custom business hours and holidays, leading to errors in the frequency validation during the test.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments made in the function align with the custom business hours and holiday constraints. Proper handling of positive and negative business hours is crucial for correct adjustments.

### Corrected Function
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0)
            n = self.n
    
            # Adjust other based on business hours
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                else:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying the corrections above, the `apply` function should now handle adjustments based on the provided custom business hours and holidays correctly and avoid the frequency validation error encountered in the failing test.
