## Explanation:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class has issues in calculating the business hours. This leads to incorrect adjustments in the timestamp, causing the failing test as the expected values are not being met.

The `apply` function is attempting to adjust the timestamp according to the business hours specified but is not handling the scenarios correctly for positive and negative business hour offsets.

The key issues causing the bug are:
1. Incorrect handling of business hours adjustment for positive and negative offsets.
2. Incorrect calculations for adjusting to the next opening time and closing time.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `apply` function, we need to ensure correct adjustments are made to the timestamp based on positive and negative business hour offsets. Additionally, the calculation logic for adjusting to the next opening time and closing time needs to be fixed.

## Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function with the necessary adjustments:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other if n >= 0 else other + bhour)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making the adjustments as described above, the corrected function should pass the failing test cases with the expected values.
