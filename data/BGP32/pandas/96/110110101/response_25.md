### Analysis
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is intended to adjust a given datetime according to custom business hours. However, the function contains several issues that lead to incorrect output and the failing test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` due to incorrect adjustments. 

The function's main issues include:
1. Incorrect adjustment of the input `other` datetime variable.
2. Misinterpretation of the business hours logic for positive and negative cases.
3. Improper handling of business days and remaining business hours. 

### Bug Explanation
The buggy function fails to correctly adjust the input datetime according to custom business hours, leading to wrong output. This behavior results in the failing test case due to discrepancies between the expected and actual output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `apply` function, the adjustments logic needs to be revised to properly handle both positive and negative `n` values, adjust business days, and remaining business hours. Additionally, correct handling of edge cases like business day boundaries should be ensured.

### Bug-fixed Function
Here is the bug-fixed version of the `apply` function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                other = other + BusinessDay(n=bd)  # adjust by business days
                
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                in_start = other.time() in self.start
                in_end = other.time() in self.end
                if (n < 0 and in_start) or (n >= 0 and (in_end or not self._is_on_offset(other))):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    if n < 0 or bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This updated version includes corrections to the adjustments logic, proper handling of business days, and ensures accurate adjustment of the input datetime according to custom business hours.
