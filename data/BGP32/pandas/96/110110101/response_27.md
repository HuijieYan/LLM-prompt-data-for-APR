### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class has issues handling adjustments related to business hours, leading to incorrect results.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is failing with a `ValueError` related to frequency validation, indicating incorrect behavior from the function.
3. The bug causes the function to return incorrect Timestamp values, leading to failed frequency validation.
4. To fix the bug, we need to address the logic for adjusting business hours and ensuring that the returned Timestamp values align with the expected frequency.
5. We need to modify the adjustment logic and ensure that the calculations for adjusting business days and business hours are correct.

### Proposed Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function in the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
            
            # Adjust to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)  # Move to previous business day
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    if bhour_remain < bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By applying the adjustments in the corrected version above, the function should now return the correct Timestamp values for the given inputs, addressing the frequency validation issues as well.
