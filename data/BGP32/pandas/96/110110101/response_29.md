### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is not correctly adjusting the datetime values based on business hours. This leads to incorrect output for certain datetime inputs and causes the failing test case.

1. The function fails to properly handle non-zero `nanosecond` values in the input `other` datetime object leading to inconsistencies in the calculations.
2. There are inconsistencies in the adjustments made to `other` based on the business hours condition causing incorrect results.
3. The logic for adjusting the business days and remaining business hours is flawed, leading to incorrect calculations in some scenarios.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `apply` function, we need to address the issues mentioned above:
1. Ensure proper handling of the `nanosecond` attribute in the input `other` datetime object.
2. Correct the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business hours, business days, and remaining business hours.
3. Verify the calculations for each step to ensure correctness based on the expected input/output values.

### Corrected Code for the `apply` Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function in the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import ApplyTypeError, CustomBusinessDay

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # adjusted for nanosecond handling
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
            nanosecond
        )
        
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        business_hours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        
        # business days calculation corrected
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            other += skip_bd
            # updated calculation for business days
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        # corrected logic for adjusting remaining business hours
        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1))
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the logic as outlined above, the `apply` function should now work correctly and pass the failing test cases.
