### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is causing issues with the `pd.date_range` function in the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`. The error message indicates a validation error related to the frequency used for the custom business hour with holidays. The buggy function is not handling the adjustment of business hours correctly, leading to the validation error.

### Bug Explanation
- The bug occurs when the function goes through the process of adjusting the business hours based on the input parameters, but the adjustment logic is flawed. This leads to incorrect outcomes when calculating the adjusted datetime values, resulting in a frequency validation error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- The logic for adjusting business hours should be reviewed and corrected to ensure that it accurately adjusts the provided datetime values while taking into account the custom business hour frequency and holidays.
- Error handling for edge cases and validation checks should be improved to prevent frequency validation errors.

### Bug-fixed Version of the Function
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
            
            # Adjust other based on business hours
            other = self._adjust_business_hours(other, n)
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
    
    def _adjust_business_hours(self, dt, n):
        target_dt = dt
        if n == 0:
            return target_dt
        
        while n != 0:
            # Adjust business hours based on direction of n
            if n > 0:
                target_dt = self._add_business_hour(target_dt)
                n -= 1
            else:
                target_dt = self._subtract_business_hour(target_dt)
                n += 1
        
        return target_dt
    
    def _add_business_hour(self, dt):
        if dt.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(dt):
            dt = self._next_opening_time(dt)
        return dt

    def _subtract_business_hour(self, dt):
        if dt.time() in self.start:
            dt = dt - timedelta(seconds=1)
        if not self._is_on_offset(dt):
            dt = self._next_opening_time(dt)
            dt = self._get_closing_time(dt)
        return dt
```

By implementing the `_adjust_business_hours`, `_add_business_hour`, and `_subtract_business_hour` methods, the function can accurately adjust the datetime value based on the custom business hours provided. This revision should resolve the frequency validation error during the test execution.
