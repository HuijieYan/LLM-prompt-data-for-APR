### Analysis
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is meant to apply the business hour offset to a given datetime. The function has multiple conditional checks and calculations to adjust the datetime based on the offset. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is trying to create a date range using a custom business hour offset, but it fails due to an error related to frequency validation.

### Bug
The bug lies in the `apply` function not correctly handling the adjustment of business days and remaining business hours when the offset is negative. This leads to incorrect adjustments and results in an error during frequency validation.

### Fix Strategy
To address the bug, we need to carefully adjust the logic in the `apply` function to correctly handle negative offsets and adjust the datetime accordingly. The adjustments should be made in a way that aligns with the business hours and business days.

### Fixed Version
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            other = other.replace(nanosecond=0)
            
            if self.n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
            
            bd, r = divmod(abs(self.n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if self.n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = other + skip_bd
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                if self.n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                else:
                    bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function should successfully apply the business hour offset to the given datetime and pass the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.
