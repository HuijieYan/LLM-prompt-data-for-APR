### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is supposed to adjust a given datetime object based on business hours. However, the function fails to handle the case when a holiday falls on the edge of a business day and misbehaves in certain scenarios, leading to an error in the `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` test.

The failing test triggers a `ValueError` related to the frequency not conforming to the passed values, causing the test to fail.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `apply` function failing to properly handle cases where a holiday falls on the edge of a business day. This leads to incorrect adjustments and ultimately causes the expected and actual outputs to differ.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the function handles holidays and edge conditions when adjusting business hours in the `apply` function. Specifically, when a holiday occurs on the edge, the function should correctly adjust the datetime object to the next valid business time.

### Bug Fix in the `apply` function
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other to reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
    
            if n >= 0:
                while not (other.time() in self.end) and not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    if other.time() in self.start or other.date() in self.holidays:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    else:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + timedelta(days=1))
            else:
                while not (other.time() in self.start) and self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if other.time() in self.start and other.date() in self.holidays:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected function should handle holidays on the edge of a business day correctly, ensuring that the adjustments maintain consistency with the business hours.
