### Strategy for fixing the bug
The bug seems to be related to the way the `apply` function adjusts the given timestamp based on the business hours. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the adjustment of business hours and days are correctly handled. Particularly, the adjustment calculations for moving to the next or previous business day need to be refined.

### Corrected Version of the buggy function
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year, other.month, other.day,
            other.hour, other.minute, other.second, other.microsecond
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = skip_bd.rollback(other)

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other) + self._get_business_hour()

        else:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other -= bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After fixing the adjustments for business days and remaining hours, the corrected version of the `apply` function should now correctly handle business hour calculations and address the issue encountered in the failing test scenario.
