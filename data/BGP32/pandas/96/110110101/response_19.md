The buggy function is causing the failing test due to incorrect logic in adjusting the business hours. The error message indicates a mismatch between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency. This discrepancy arises from incorrect calculations within the function.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling business hours and adjusting the timestamps accordingly. The faulty logic seems to cause improper transitions between business time intervals.

Here is a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # Check if the time needs to be adjusted based on start/end times
        def adjust_time(dt):
            if dt.time() not in self.end:
                dt = self._next_opening_time(dt)
            return dt

        # Adjust the timestamp based on positive/negative business hours
        if n >= 0:
            other = adjust_time(other)
        else:
            other = other - timedelta(seconds=1) if other.time() in self.start else other
            other = adjust_time(other)
            other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Calculate business hours in a day
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        
        # Calculate business days adjustment and remaining business hours
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # Remaining business hours to adjust and adjust hours accordingly
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = adjust_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour))
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

```

By correcting the adjustment logic in the function, it should now be able to handle the business hours properly and pass the failing test cases. Make sure to test the corrected function with the provided failing test to ensure it works as expected.
