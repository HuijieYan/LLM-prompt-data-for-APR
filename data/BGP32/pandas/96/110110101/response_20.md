The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class has a bug that causes the test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` to fail. The error originates from the incorrect handling of custom business hour offsets, resulting in an inconsistent frequency validation error.

### Bug Analysis:
1. The custom business hour offset is not processed correctly, leading to discrepancies in frequency validation.
2. The adjustment logic for business days and remaining business hours is not properly implemented.
3. The calculations for adjusting the time intervals within business hours are incorrect, leading to unexpected results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Properly adjust the custom business hour offset and handle the holiday exclusion logic.
2. Correctly implement the adjustment logic for business days and remaining business hours.
3. Fix the calculations for adjusting time intervals within business hours to produce the expected output.

### Bug Fix (Corrected Version of the `apply` Function):
```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            
            other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0)
            n = self.n

            # Check if time falls within business hours and adjust accordingly
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() not in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # Calculate total business hours in a day
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd

            # Continue adjusting for remaining business hours
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

            return other.replace(microsecond=0)

        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By applying this corrected version of the `apply` function, the test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` should pass successfully, producing the expected output values for all cases.
