### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class used for applying custom business hours logic.
2. The function takes a timestamp as input and adjusts it based on the custom business hours defined in the class.
3. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is testing the behavior of custom business hours with holidays and specific start times.
4. The error occurs during the execution of the test when validating the frequency of the generated date range.
5. The expected output of the function is a timestamp adjusted according to the custom business hours.

### Bug Identified:
The bug likely occurs when the function adjusts the timestamp for negative business hours and attempts to move to the next business time interval.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the logic for adjusting the timestamp to handle negative business hours is correct.
2. Check the conditions for moving to the next business time interval and adjust the logic accordingly.
3. Verify the calculations related to business days and remaining business hours for accurate adjustments.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd
    
            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the logic in the negative business hours section and ensuring accurate adjustment for the remaining business hours, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases.
