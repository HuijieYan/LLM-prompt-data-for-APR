## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is not correctly adjusting business hours in certain edge cases when combining a CustomBusinessHour with a DateTime object. This is causing the `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` test to fail with a `ValueError` during frequency validation.

The key issue seems to arise from the incorrect handling of adjustments when the number of business hours `n` is positive or negative, leading to unexpected behavior in skipping over certain business time intervals.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `apply` function, we need to carefully analyze the adjustments made for positive and negative `n` values and ensure that the logic correctly adjusts the DateTime object while considering open and closing times of the business hours.

Here are the high-level steps needed to fix the bug:
1. Adjust the logic for handling positive and negative `n` values to correctly adjust the DateTime object to the next opening or closing time within the defined business hours.
2. Ensure that the adjustments consider the specific edge cases related to the business time intervals and adjust the DateTime object within those intervals accordingly.
3. Update the return value to be the adjusted DateTime object.

## Bug-fix Implementation: 

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay, CustomBusinessHour
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # Corrected apply function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0)

            n = self.n
            if n >= 0:
                # Case for positive n value
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                # Case for negative n value
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # move to the previous business day
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # calculate total business hours in a day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            # calculate the adjustments for business days and remaining business hours
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = self.next_bday.apply(other)

            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            # adjust remaining business hours within business time intervals
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other) + bhour
            else:
                while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the logic for adjusting business hours based on the positive or negative `n` values, and ensuring proper handling of edge cases within the defined business intervals, the `apply` function should now pass the failing test and provide the desired behavior.
