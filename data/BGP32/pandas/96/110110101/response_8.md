### Analyzing the buggy function
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which is related to business hour offsets in pandas.
2. The function is designed to adjust a given datetime object based on custom business hours and holidays.
3. The function checks if the input `other` is a `datetime` object, then adjusts it according to the business hours specified.
4. There are several calculations involved in adjusting the datetime object, such as considering business hours and skipping holidays.

### Identification of potential error locations
1. The function seems to handle the adjustment of the given datetime through multiple conditions and calculations.
2. The issue might be related to how the adjustments are made based on business hours, holidays, and the direction of adjustment.

### Cause of the bug
1. The test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` fails because the function `apply` does not handle the adjustment for holidays correctly. It causes the adjusted datetime to fall on a holiday, leading to a mismatch with the expected result.
2. The existing logic in the function does not account for holidays when adjusting the datetime, leading to incorrect results.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
1. We need to update the logic in the `apply` function to correctly adjust the datetime while considering holidays in the calculation.
2. We should ensure that the adjusted datetime does not fall on a holiday and follows the business hour constraints specified.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        adjusted_datetime = other

        # adjust the datetime based on business hours and holidays
        for _ in range(abs(n)):
            adjusted_datetime = self._adjust_datetime(adjusted_datetime, n)

        return adjusted_datetime
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

def _adjust_datetime(self, dt, direction):
    while True:
        if direction >= 0:
            if dt.time() in self.end:
                dt = self._next_opening_time(dt)
            if not self._is_on_offset(dt) or self._is_holiday(dt):
                dt = self._next_opening_time(dt)
        else:
            if dt.time() in self.start:
                dt = dt - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if self._is_holiday(dt) or not self._is_on_offset(dt):
                dt = self._prev_opening_time(dt)

        if not self._is_holiday(dt):
            break

    return dt
```

By updating the `_adjust_datetime` method to correctly handle adjustments based on business hours, holidays, and direction, we ensure that the corrected `apply` function produces the expected results for adjusting the datetime object.
