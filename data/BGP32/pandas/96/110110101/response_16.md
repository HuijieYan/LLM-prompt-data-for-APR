### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class within the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is encountering an error due to improper handling of custom business hours and holidays.
2. The error message suggests a ValueError is raised when trying to validate the frequency of a provided index based on the custom business hours and holidays.
3. The bug is likely caused by incorrect adjustments to the provided `other` timestamp within the `apply` function, leading to incorrect calculations of business days and hours.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments made to the `other` timestamp account for holidays and business days properly while calculating business hours accurately.
5. The corrected version of the `apply` function is provided below:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
        
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
        
            working_time = abs(n) * 60 * 60
            sign = 1 if n >= 0 else -1
            look_ahead = working_time // businesshours * sign
            diff = working_time % businesshours
        
            new_day = other
            while diff >= self._get_business_hours_by_sec(new_day.time(), self.end[0]):
                new_day = self._next_opening_time(new_day) + timedelta(hours=look_ahead)
                diff -= self._get_business_hours_by_sec(new_day.time(), self.start[0])
        
            business_hour_remain = timedelta(seconds=diff)
            return new_day + business_hour_remain
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function should now properly handle the adjustments for custom business hours and holidays, fixing the bug and passing the failing test case.
