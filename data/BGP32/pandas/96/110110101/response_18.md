## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is causing the failing test due to incorrect handling of time intervals, business days, and adjustments for business hours. The function is intended to adjust a given datetime object based on business hours, but it is not correctly calculating and adjusting the time intervals and business days.

The failing test is trying to create a `DatetimeIndex` with a custom business hour frequency. The test fails with a `ValueError` related to frequency validation, showing that the adjustments made in the `apply` function are causing incorrect behavior.

The expected input values include a `Timestamp` object, integer values for various parameters, tuples for start and end times, and a custom business hour definition. The expected output values include adjusted datetime objects and timedelta values.

## Bug Location and Cause
1. The calculation of adjustments for business days (`skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)`) and remaining business hours (`bhour_remain`) is causing issues.
2. The adjustment logic for negative `n` values needs refinement, affecting the correct adjustment for previous business days and hours.

The bug is likely caused by incorrect calculations of business days and hours adjustments, leading to the incorrect adjustment of the datetime object.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Refactor the adjustment logic to handle business days and remaining business hours more accurately.
2. Correct the adjustment for negative `n` values to ensure proper movement to previous business days and hours.

## Corrected Function
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        
        adjusted_time = other.time()
        
        if n >= 0:
            if adjusted_time in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if adjusted_time in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        if bd != 0:
            if n > 0 or (n < 0 and not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other)):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                
            for _ in range(abs(bd)):
                other += BusinessDay(n=1)
                
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        
        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            bhour_to_add = self._get_closing_time(other) - other if n >= 0 else self._next_opening_time(other) - other
            remaining_seconds = bhour_to_add.total_seconds()
            
            if remaining_seconds <= bhour_remain.total_seconds():
                other += bhour_to_add
                bhour_remain -= bhour_to_add
            else:
                other += timedelta(seconds=bhour_remain.total_seconds())
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours, the corrected function should now handle the adjustments correctly and pass the failing test with the expected input/output values.
