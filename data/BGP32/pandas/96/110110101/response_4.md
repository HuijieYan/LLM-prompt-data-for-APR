### Analyzing the bug

The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is designed to adjust a given date and time based on business hours and holidays. The bug seems to be related to how the adjustment is calculated and applied.

The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is trying to create a date range with custom business hours and holidays, but it fails with a `ValueError` related to frequency validation. This suggests that the adjustment implemented in the `apply` function is incorrect, causing the frequency check to fail.

### Identifying potential error locations

1. Incorrect calculation or application of business hours adjustment in the `apply` function.
2. Incorrect handling of the adjustment for different cases of positive and negative business hours.
3. Potential issues with the adjustment of business days in the function.
4. Incorrect handling of the remaining business hours adjustment.

### Cause of the bug

The `apply` function is not adjusting the input date and time correctly based on the business hour offset. This results in mismatched frequencies when creating the date range in the failing test. The adjustment logic inside the function seems to have issues with both positive and negative business hours cases, causing inaccuracies in the output.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to carefully review and correct the adjustment logic in the `apply` function. It is crucial to properly apply the business hour offset for different scenarios, handle adjustments for business days, and ensure correct calculation of remaining business hour adjustments.

### Corrected Version of the Function

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function with the necessary fixes:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            while n != 0:
                if n > 0:
                    other = self._add_business_hours(other)
                    n -= 1
                else:
                    other = self._subtract_business_hours(other)
                    n += 1

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, the adjustment logic has been revised to properly handle the business hour offsets and adjustments for both positive and negative cases. This should address the frequency validation issue encountered in the failing test.
