### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class seems to be designed to handle adjusting business hours based on a given datetime input.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is testing the behavior of custom business hours with holidays included.
3. The error message indicates a `ValueError` raised during a frequency validation check, which suggests that the adjustments made by the `apply` function are not conforming to the expected frequency.
4. The adjustments in the function may not be accurately reflecting the custom business hour intervals and holidays, leading to incorrect output.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function `apply` is not correctly handling the adjustments for custom business hours and holidays, causing the frequency mismatch error in the failing test.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the adjustments properly reflect the custom business hours and handle holidays correctly.
2. Update the logic for adjusting business hours based on the custom settings.

### Correction:
Here is a corrected version of the `apply` function in the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start or self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_closing_time(other)
        
        if isinstance(other, Timestamp) and other.freq == self:
            return other + n

        current = other
        while n != 0:
            current += np.sign(n) * timedelta(minutes=60)
            if self.onOffset(current) and self._is_on_offset(current):
                n -= np.sign(n)
        return current
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version addresses the issues in adjusting the business hours based on the specified custom business intervals and holidays.
