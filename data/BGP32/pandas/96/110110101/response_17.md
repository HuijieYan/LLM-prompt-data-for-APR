### Analysis
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is causing errors in the test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`. The error message indicates that the frequency validation is failing due to an issue with the custom business hour. The expected values and types of variables provided for different test cases help identify where the bug might be located.

### Bug Cause
The bug seems to be related to how the custom business hour offsets are being used or calculated in the `apply` function. It appears that the adjustments made to the `other` datetime object based on the business hours and custom offsets are not properly aligning with the expected business hours. This discrepancy is leading to a failed validation of the frequency.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, ensure that the adjustments made to the `other` datetime object are correctly aligning with the custom business hour offsets specified. Pay close attention to the logic that handles adjustments based on positive or negative numbers of business hours. Additionally, double-check how the custom business hour offsets are being applied in various calculations.

### Bug-fixed Function
Here is a bug-fixed version of the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        while n > 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            n -= 1

        while n < 0:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other.replace(hour=self.end[0].hour, minute=self.end[0].minute)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            n += 1

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This fixed version focuses on adjusting the `other` datetime object based on positive or negative business hour offsets as specified in the `BusinessHourMixin`. It ensures that the adjustments are correctly applied to align with the custom business hours.
