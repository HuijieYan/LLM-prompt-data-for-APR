### Analysis:
The buggy function, `apply`, is intended to adjust a timestamp based on a given business hour offset. The function is expected to handle various cases based on the input `other` and adjust it accordingly. The issue reported on GitHub highlights a problem where including holidays in the offset configuration causes the number of periods to be miscalculated leading to incorrect timestamps.

### Bug Identification:
The bug likely lies in the logic related to adjusting the timestamp when a holiday is involved. It seems that the calculations within the function are not accounting for holidays properly, leading to an incorrect number of periods being considered.

### Bug Cause:
The bug appears to stem from an inadequate handling of holidays within the adjustment logic of the function. When holidays are encountered, the function fails to adjust the timestamp correctly, resulting in additional periods being added unintentionally.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic within the function related to adjusting for holidays. Specifically, we should ensure that when a holiday is encountered, the adjustment correctly accounts for it by maintaining the correct number of periods without introducing errors.

### Corrected Function:
```python
from pandas._libs.tslibs.offsets import ApplyTypeError, BusinessDay

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        businesshours = 0
        for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end):
            businesshours += self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n) * 60, businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        dt = other.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)

        if n >= 0:
            if self._is_on_offset(other):
                dt += timedelta(days=1)
            while bd != 0:
                if not self._is_on_offset(dt):
                    dt += timedelta(days=1)
                else:
                    bd -= 1
            while self._get_business_hours_by_sec(self.start[0], dt.time()) < r * 60:
                dt += timedelta(seconds=60)
        else:
            if self._is_on_offset(other):
                dt -= timedelta(days=1)
            while bd != 0:
                if not self._is_on_offset(dt):
                    dt -= timedelta(days=1)
                else:
                    bd += 1
            while self._get_business_hours_by_sec(dt.time(), self.end[0]) < r * 60:
                dt -= timedelta(seconds=60)

        return dt.replace(hour=other.hour, minute=other.minute, second=other.second, microsecond=other.microsecond)
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected function should address the issue reported on GitHub by correctly adjusting the timestamp considering holidays and maintaining the expected number of periods without introducing errors.
