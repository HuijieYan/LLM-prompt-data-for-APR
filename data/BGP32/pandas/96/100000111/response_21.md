## Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is intended to adjust a given timestamp based on custom business hours and days specified. However, in some scenarios, it misbehaves and produces unexpected results, potentially causing the issue described in the GitHub problem where `pd.date_range` with periods and holidays does not work correctly.

### Identified Issue
The root cause of the bug seems to stem from the logic within the `apply` function that adjusts the timestamp for business days and hours. There are several branches in the logic that might not handle the calculations properly, leading to incorrect adjustments.

### Suggested Fix
To address the issue, I suggest reviewing the logic for adjusting the timestamp based on the business days and hours to ensure correct calculations. Specifically, focus on the cases where the adjustments are made for positive and negative `n` values.

## Code Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                bhour = self._get_business_seconds_from_opening(other)
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() < 0:
                bhour = self._get_business_seconds_to_closing(other)
                if (
                    bhour_remain > bhour
                    or bhour_remain == bhour
                    and nanosecond != 0
                ):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(
                        self._next_opening_time(
                            other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                        )
                    )

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the adjustment logic for business days and hours in the `apply` function, the function should behave correctly according to the expected input/output values and resolve the issue detailed in the GitHub problem.
