### Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is intended to adjust a given datetime value based on custom business hours. The issue in the GitHub post relates to unexpected behavior in the `date_range` function when using custom business hours with holidays.

### Bugs
1. The function manipulation of the `other` datetime value is not consistent and might lead to incorrect results.
2. There are potential issues with how business days are calculated and adjusted.
3. The handling of remaining business hours for adjusting the datetime is inefficient and may lead to incorrect offsets.

### Bug Cause
The bug in the `apply` function arises from inconsistent adjustments of the `other` datetime, potential flaws in business days calculation, and inefficient handling of remaining business hours. This inconsistency and inefficiency can lead to incorrect datetime adjustments.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure consistent datetime manipulation throughout the function to maintain accuracy.
2. Review the calculation and handling of business days to ensure correct adjustments.
3. Refactor the logic for adjusting remaining business hours to be more efficient and accurate.

### Code Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function based on the identified bugs and the expected input/output values:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # Adjust other based on the input values
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        # Adjust the other datetime based on opening/closing times and offsets
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        # Calculate business days based on total business hours
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # Remaining business hours adjustment efficiently
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
            # Calculate the remaining time interval
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                delta = min(bhour_remain, bhour)
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                delta = max(bhour_remain, bhour) if nanosecond != 0 else min(bhour_remain, bhour)

            other += delta
            bhour_remain -= delta

            if n >= 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version incorporates consistent datetime adjustments, accurate business day calculations, and efficient handling of remaining business hours, addressing the identified bugs and the expected input/output values.
