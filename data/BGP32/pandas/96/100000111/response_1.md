### Analysis
The buggy function is supposed to adjust a given datetime object based on custom business hours. The function takes into account the start time, end time, holidays, and other parameters to calculate the adjusted datetime. However, the function has a bug that causes unexpected behavior when adjusting the datetime.

### Error Location
The bug seems to stem from the calculation of `bd` and `r` values incorrectly, leading to improper adjustments of the input datetime.

### Bug Explanation
The bug causes the function to miscalculate the number of business days and remaining business hours to adjust the input datetime correctly. This leads to discrepancies in the adjusted datetime values, as observed in the failing test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure the correct calculation of `bd` (business days) and `r` (remaining minutes) based on the provided input parameters. Adjustments need to be made concerning these values to correctly adjust the input datetime within the specified business hours.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour, CustomBusinessDay
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * businesshours), 60)

        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should address the calculation issues and adjust the input datetime based on the custom business hour rules accurately.
