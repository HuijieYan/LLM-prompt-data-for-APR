### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function is designed to adjust a given datetime based on custom business hours. However, it fails to handle the case correctly when holidays are involved, resulting in unexpected behavior as described in the GitHub issue. The function appears to calculate the number of business hours incorrectly, leading to incorrect adjustments in the datetime.

### Error Location:
The issue seems to stem from the calculation of business hours and the adjustment logic based on the number of business days and remaining hours.

### Bug Cause:
The bug likely arises due to the inaccurate calculation of the number of business hours in a day, incorrect adjustment logic for business days, and inconsistencies in adjusting remaining hours within a business day.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To address the bug, we need to ensure that the function accurately calculates the total number of business hours in a day, correctly adjusts for business days, and handles remaining hours within a business day properly. Additionally, the adjustment logic needs to be revised to account for holidays effectively.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        total_business_hours = sum(
            (en.hour * 60 + en.minute) - (st.hour * 60 + st.minute)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), total_business_hours)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            holiday_count = sum(1 for holiday in self.holidays if other.date() > holiday)
            skip_days = BusinessDay(n=(bd + holiday_count))
            other += skip_days

        if r != 0:
            minutes_remain = r
            positive_increment = n >= 0
            while minutes_remain != 0:
                current_hour = other.hour * 60 + other.minute
                if positive_increment:
                    next_open_hour = min(st.hour * 60 + st.minute for st in self.start if st.hour * 60 + st.minute > current_hour)
                    diff = min(next_open_hour - current_hour, minutes_remain)
                else:
                    prev_end_hour = max(en.hour * 60 + en.minute for en in self.end if en.hour * 60 + en.minute < current_hour)
                    diff = min(current_hour - prev_end_hour, -minutes_remain)

                other += timedelta(minutes=diff)
                minutes_remain -= diff

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function should now accurately adjust the given datetime based on custom business hours, accounting for holidays, business days, and remaining hours within a business day correctly.
