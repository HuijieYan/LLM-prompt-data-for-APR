### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` seems to be related to date and time arithmetic involving business hours. The function is intended to adjust a given datetime based on the CustomBusinessHour specifications. The bug likely pertains to the adjustment logic, resulting in unexpected output values which are causing the GitHub issue related to `date_range` not working as expected when holidays are involved.

### Identified issues:
1. The adjustment logic in the function based on business days and remaining hours is likely causing the erroneous behavior.
2. The adjustment to move to the previous business day and handling the next business time interval is not functioning correctly, leading to unexpected results.

### Bug cause:
The buggy implementation does not correctly handle adjustments regarding business days and remaining business hours within the loop iterations, resulting in incorrect results when holidays are involved. This behavior leads to the issue reported on GitHub regarding unexpected output from `date_range` when incorporating holidays.

### Bug fix strategy:
To address the bug, the adjustments related to business days and business hours must be thoroughly reviewed and potentially revised to accurately handle the datetime adjustments within business hours.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        adjusted_time = other
        if n >= 0:
            for _ in range(abs(n)):
                adjusted_time = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_time)
        else:
            for _ in range(abs(n)):
                adjusted_time = self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_time)

        return adjusted_time
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Explanation:
I modified the function to simplify the adjustment logic to increment or decrement the datetime based on the specified number of CustomBusinessHours. This revised version aims to fix the buggy behavior while maintaining the expected output values in various cases provided.
