### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function, `apply`, is part of the `pandas.tseries.offsets` module.
2. The function takes `self` and `other` as parameters, with `other` expected to be a `datetime` object.
3. The function manipulates the `other` datetime object based on the provided conditions.
4. The bug seems to be related to the calculation of business hours and adjustments to the datetime object.
5. The impact of the bug is causing unexpected dates to be generated when adding holidays while using the `periods` parameter in `pd.date_range`.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The bug is causing incorrect adjustments to the `other` datetime object based on the business hours and holidays provided.
2. This results in the `date_range` function returning more periods than expected, as observed in the GitHub issue description.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Correctly manipulate the `other` datetime object based on the business hours and holiday conditions.
2. Ensure that the adjustments maintain the correct number of periods as expected by the `date_range` function.

### Bug-fixed Function:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import ApplyTypeError, BaseOffset, apply_wraps

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Conclusion:
The bug in the `apply` function has been fixed by adjusting the manipulations of the `other` datetime object based on business hours and holidays. The corrected function should now return the expected number of periods as required by the `pd.date_range` function.
