### Analysis:
The buggy function seems to be related to business hour adjustments based on the given parameters. The bug might be causing incorrect adjustments when handling business days, resulting in values that do not align with the expected output in the provided GitHub issue.

### Error location:
The bug could be in the sections where the function adjusts the input `other` datetime based on the specified business hours and days.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the adjustment of business days and business hours, especially the calculation of remaining business hours to adjust. This misalignment in adjustment is likely leading to the unexpected output as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To address the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments of business days and hours are correctly calculated and applied to the `other` datetime based on the specified parameters. By carefully checking the conditions for adjusting business days and hours, we can align the function's behavior with the expected output values.

### Corrected function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        start_time = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, other.hour, other.minute)
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        business_day = BusinessDay(n=bd)
        adjusted_datetime = start_time

        if bd != 0:
            if n > 0:
                adjusted_datetime += business_day
            else:
                adjusted_datetime -= business_day
        
        while r != 0:
            if n >= 0:
                next_opening = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_datetime)
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_datetime)) - adjusted_datetime
            else:
                next_opening = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_datetime)
                bhour = next_opening - adjusted_datetime
            
            if r < bhour.total_seconds() // 60:
                adjusted_datetime += timedelta(minutes=r)
                r = 0
            else:
                adjusted_datetime = next_opening
                r -= bhour.total_seconds() // 60

        return adjusted_datetime
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version aims to appropriately adjust the `other` datetime based on the business hours and days specified in the function parameters. The adjustments consider both business days and remaining business hours to align with the expected output values from the GitHub issue.
