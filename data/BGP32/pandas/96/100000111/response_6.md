### Bug Fix Strategy:
The buggy function `apply` is meant to adjust a given datetime object based on business hours and holidays. The bug arises due to incorrect adjustments being made for business days and business hours, leading to unexpected output. To fix this issue, we need to correct the calculations for adjusting business days and hours within the function.

Here's an overview of the strategy to fix the bug:
1. Correct the adjustments for business days and business hours based on the input parameters and conditions specified in the GitHub issue.
2. Ensure that the adjustments are made accurately for both positive and negative values of `n`.
3. Refactor the code to improve readability and maintainability.

### Bug Fixed Version:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # adjust holiday
        if other in self.holidays:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        # adjust based on business hours
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            # midnight business hour may not be on BusinessDay
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            elif n >= 0:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # calculate remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other) + timedelta(seconds=bhour_remain.total_seconds())
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other + bhour_remain)
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                
        if nanosecond:
            other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should handle the given test cases accurately and address the issue reported on GitHub.
