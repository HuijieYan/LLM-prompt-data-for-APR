### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is designed to adjust a given `datetime` object based on a set of business hour rules provided by a `CustomBusinessHour` object. The bug seems to be causing unexpected adjustments leading to incorrect output, as reported in the GitHub issue involving `pd.date_range`.

### Error:
The issue arises from the incorrect adjustment of the input `datetime` object `other`, leading to unexpected behavior in handling business hour offsets.

### Cause of the bug:
1. Inconsistent adjustment logic for positive and negative `self.n` values.
2. Incorrect handling of business hour boundaries in the adjustment process.
3. Incorrect calculation of business hour remainders leading to unexpected results.
4. Inadequate handling of edge cases leading to improper adjustments.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure consistent adjustment logic for both positive and negative `self.n`.
2. Implement proper handling of business hour boundaries to ensure accurate adjustments.
3. Correctly calculate and adjust business hour remainders to reflect the correct adjustment path.
4. Update edge case checks to handle all scenarios appropriately.

### Bug-fixed version of the `apply` function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            if n >= 0:
                if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should address the identified issues and provide the expected adjustments when integrating with functions like `pd.date_range`.
