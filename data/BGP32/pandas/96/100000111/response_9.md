### Analysis:
The buggy function is supposed to adjust the time based on business hours, considering weekends and holidays. The function seems to be incorrectly handling the adjustment of dates due to business hours and holidays. 

### Issues:
1. The function doesn't handle holiday adjustments correctly, potentially leading to unexpected results.
2. There is a discrepancy in how weekends and holidays are handled, leading to incorrect date adjustments.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function fails to adjust the dates correctly based on business hours, weekends, and holidays. This results in output that deviates from the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Implement a proper handling mechanism for holidays within the function.
2. Ensure that weekends and holidays are properly accounted for in the date adjustment process.

### Code Fix:
Below is the corrected version of the function considering the issues identified:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() not in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making the necessary adjustments to the date handling logic, the corrected function should now behave appropriately according to the expected input and output values provided in the GitHub issue.
