### Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is supposed to handle business hour offsets based on the input datetime `other` and some defined business hours. The function includes logic to adjust the input datetime to fit within the business hour constraints. The function addresses cases where `n` is a positive or negative integer, indicating moving forward or backward in time based on business hours.

### Bugs and Causes
1. The function does not correctly handle the case where the input `other` datetime is on the business hour start time or when `n` is negative and the `other` time is within the offset.
2. There are issues with handling the adjustment of business days (`bd`) and remaining hours (`r`) causing incorrect calculations and time adjustments.

### Fix Strategy
1. Adjust the logic for handling cases where `other` datetime is exactly the same as the start time of the business hour offset.
2. Make sure to properly adjust for negative offsets.
3. Correctly calculate business days and remaining hours adjustments.

### Corrected Function
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import ApplyTypeError, BusinessHour

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if other.time() == self.start[0] and n >= 0:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            other = other + bd * BusinessHour()

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

            if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                bhour_remain -= bhour

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the identified bugs and should now handle the expected input/output values and resolve the issue reported on GitHub effectively.
