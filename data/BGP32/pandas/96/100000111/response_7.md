### Analysis:
The buggy function, `apply`, is supposed to adjust a datetime object based on business hours and holidays. The issue reported on GitHub involves unexpected behavior when using `pd.date_range` with periods and holidays, resulting in more than the expected number of periods.

### Bugs:
1. The logic for adjusting the datetime object based on business hours and holidays seems to be incorrect, leading to incorrect behavior.
2. The adjustment for holidays is not correctly handled, causing the unexpected addition of periods in the `pd.date_range`.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function does not properly adjust datetime objects when holidays are involved, leading to discrepancies in the calculated periods.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the adjustment of the datetime object considers holidays correctly.
2. Verify that the logic for adding periods is accurate and adjusts the datetime object as expected.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        
        n = self.n

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)

            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

        if self.holidays and other in self.holidays:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function involves adjusting the datetime object based on business hours and properly accounting for holidays to prevent the issue encountered with `pd.date_range`.
