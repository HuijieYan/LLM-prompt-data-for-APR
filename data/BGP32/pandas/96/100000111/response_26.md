### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is intended to apply business hour offsets to a given timestamp. The function is encountering issues when adjusting the timestamp based on the business hours, resulting in unexpected behavior. The GitHub issue reflects a similar problem where the `pd.date_range` function produces unexpected results when using periods with holidays.

### Error Location:
The bug seems to arise from the adjustment of the timestamp in the function based on business days and hours. The logic for adjusting the timestamp and handling negative offsets needs to be reviewed.

### Bug Cause:
The bug likely stems from the incorrect calculation and adjustment of business days and hours in the function. This causes the timestamp to be shifted incorrectly, as highlighted in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Review the logic for adjusting the timestamp based on business days and hours.
2. Ensure that the calculations for business days and hours are accurate and handle both positive and negative offsets correctly.
3. Verify the logic for handling edge cases and adjusting the timestamp accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        
        next_opening_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
        prev_opening_time = self._prev_opening_time(other)
        
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() not in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = next_opening_time
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                remain = other - prev_opening_time
                other = prev_opening_time + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd
        
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        
        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
                bhour = self._get_business_hour(prev_opening_time) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta()
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta()
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function aims to address the issues observed in the buggy function and is expected to produce correct outputs for the provided test cases and the GitHub issue.
