### Approach:
1. The buggy function is `apply`. It takes a `Timestamp` object and adjusts it based on business hours specified by the provided `CustomBusinessHour` object.
2. The bug seems to be related to the adjustments made to the `other` timestamp based on the specified business hours.
3. The cause of the bug is likely due to incorrect calculations and adjustments made to the `other` timestamp considering the business hours specified.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure accurate adjustments based on the given business hours and handle edge cases properly.
5. We will correct the adjustments made to the `other` timestamp and ensure that the function returns the expected output for all given test cases.

### Code Fix:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() >= self.end[0] or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() <= self.start[0]:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the calculations based on business hours and edge conditions, the corrected `apply` function should now provide the expected output for all test cases and address the issue reported on GitHub.
