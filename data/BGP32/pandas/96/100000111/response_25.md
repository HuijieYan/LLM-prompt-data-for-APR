### Analysis:
- The buggy function receives a `Timestamp` object named `other` as input, along with other parameters like `self`, `n`, `nanosecond`, `businesshours`, etc.
- The function is designed to adjust the given timestamp `other` based on the custom business hours defined in `self` and the `n` value.
- The bug seems to manifest as the function behavior doesn't align with the expected output values.
- The issue on GitHub is related to unexpected behavior when adding holidays to the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency, leading to more periods generated than expected.

### Bugs Identified:
1. The calculation of business hours seems incorrect, leading to incorrect adjustments to the input timestamp.
2. The adjustment logic based on business days (`bd`) and remaining business hours (`r`) is flawed, causing incorrect advancement or delay of the timestamp.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Verify the calculation of business hours and adjust it accordingly to accurately determine the offset timing.
2. Review and modify the logic related to business day adjustments to ensure proper handling of forwards and backwards shifts based on the business hours.

### Bug-fixed Function:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessHour

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            (self.end[i] - self.start[i]).seconds
            for i in range(len(self.start))
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            business_day_offset = bd * BusinessHour()
            other = other + business_day_offset

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = (self.end[0] - other.time()).total_seconds()
                if bhour_remain < bhour * 60:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= timedelta(minutes=bhour)
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other) + BusinessHour()
        else:
            while bhour_remain < timedelta(0):
                bhour = (other.time() - self.start[0]).total_seconds()
                if bhour_remain > bhour * 60 or (bhour_remain == bhour * 60 and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain += timedelta(minutes=bhour)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other) + BusinessHour() + timedelta(seconds=-1))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Result:
The bug-fixed function should now handle the adjustments for the input timestamp `other` correctly based on the custom business hours specified in `self` and the provided business day shift. This correction should align the function's behavior with the expected output values in the given test cases and resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to unexpected behavior with adding holidays in the frequency.
