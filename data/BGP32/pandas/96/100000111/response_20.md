### Bug Diagnosis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is designed to adjust a given date and time based on business hours and certain conditions.
2. The function has multiple conditional blocks handling adjustments for positive and negative business hours, using various calculations and offsets.
3. The bug seems to be related to the adjustment logic within the function, which leads to unexpected outputs when dealing with specific input scenarios, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.
4. The described issue involves the function producing more periods than expected when holidays are included in the frequency definition, resulting in a discrepancy in the final output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Review the logic related to holiday handling within the function `apply`, as this seems to be a point of failure causing the discrepancy in the number of periods.
2. Ensure that adjustments made for holidays do not interfere with the overall calculation of business hours and time intervals in a way that introduces extra periods in the output.
3. Validate the handling of date and time adjustments in different scenarios, especially when holidays are involved, to ensure consistency and correctness.
4. Modify the logic and calculations within the function to accurately adjust the given date and time based on business hours while accounting for holidays as specified.

### Bug-fixed Version of the Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
            if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                other += bhour
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Changes Made:
1. Simplified the holiday adjustment logic to avoid introducing extra periods in the output.
2. Modified the adjustment process within the `while` loop to ensure accurate handling of business hours and time intervals.
3. Refactored the function to focus on precise adjustments based on business hours while maintaining consistency and correctness.

Now, the corrected function should address the issue described in the GitHub problem statement and produce the expected outputs for the given input scenarios.
