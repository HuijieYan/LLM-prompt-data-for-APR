### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is designed to adjust a given datetime `other` based on business hours specified by the custom business hour object `self`. The bug arises from the incorrect handling of adjustments when dealing with business days and business hours.

### Error Location
1. In the case of adjusting by business days first, the logic for handling business days and remaining business hours seems to be incorrect.
2. The adjustment calculation within the while loops for adjusting remaining business hours is causing the issue when determining the next business time intervals.

### Bug Cause
The bug causes the function to misadjust the datetime when dealing with business days and remaining business hours, leading to incorrect output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours needs to be corrected. Additionally, the calculations within the while loops should be revised to ensure accurate adjustment of the datetime.

### Corrected Function
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n_initial = self.n
        original_other = other
        
        # Adjust timezone and nanosecond
        if n_initial >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        business_hours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n_initial * 60), business_hours // 60)
        
        if n_initial < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        while bd != 0:
            new_qty = bd if bd > 0 else -1
            new_bh = BusinessDay(n=new_qty)
            other = new_bh.rollforward(other)
            bd -= new_qty
        
        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        
        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if self.n > 0:
                curr_closest = self._get_closing_time(other)
                next_opening_after_this = self._next_opening_time(other)
                bhour = curr_closest - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = next_opening_after_this
            else:
                next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
                next_closing = self._get_closing_time(next_opening - timedelta(seconds=1))
                bhour = next_opening - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = next_closing
                    
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the business days and remaining business hours logic within the function, the corrected version should handle the adjustments accurately and provide the expected output for the given test cases.
