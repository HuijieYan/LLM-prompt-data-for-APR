### Analysis:
- The buggy function is the `apply` method inside the `BusinessHourMixin` class.
- The issue seems related to handling holidays in custom business hours, leading to an incorrect number of periods in the resulting date range.
- The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` demonstrates the problem by showing that adding a holiday to the custom business hour results in an unexpected output.
- The GitHub issue further details the problem and confirms that replacing `periods` with `end` resolves the issue.

### Error Locations:
1. Handling of holidays in the `apply` method might be incorrect.
2. Calculation of business day adjustment based on holidays may be flawed.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function does not handle holidays correctly when adjusting the datetime for custom business hours. This results in an incorrect number of periods in the date range output.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling holidays in the `apply` method to ensure the correct calculation of periods in the resulting date range.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
            
            if self.is_on_offset(other) and other.time() not in self.start:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            
            hours = abs(n) * 60
            bd, r = divmod(hours, businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
            
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    other = self.next_bday.apply(other)
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
            
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain < timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                        )
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `apply` method in the `BusinessHourMixin` class should now handle holidays correctly when adjusting datetime for custom business hours, ensuring the date range output is as expected.
