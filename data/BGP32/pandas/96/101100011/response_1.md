## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is responsible for adjusting datetime objects based on business hours.
2. The bug seems to be causing incorrect adjustments when handling negative business hours and holidays, leading to unexpected results in the test case provided.
3. The issue reported on GitHub also confirms the problem with the behavior of `date_range` when using periods and adding holidays with `CustomBusinessHour` frequencies.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the logic within the `apply` function correctly handles adjustments for both positive and negative business hours while considering holidays.

## Bug Cause:
The bug seems to occur when trying to adjust datetime objects based on business hours. It fails to handle negative business hours and holidays properly, leading to incorrect adjustments and unexpected results in scenarios like the test case provided.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Evaluate the logic for adjusting datetime based on business hours for both positive and negative cases.
2. Ensure that holiday handling is integrated into the adjustment process to correctly skip holidays while adjusting the datetime.
3. Verify that the adjustments consider the start and end times of business hours and handle scenarios involving negative business hours gracefully.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# Fix the bug in the apply function
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        
        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        
        while bd != 0:
            if n >= 0:
                other = other + BusinessDay(n=1)
                bd -= 1
            else:
                other = other - BusinessDay(n=1)
                bd += 1
        
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        
        opening_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                closing_time = self._get_closing_time(opening_time)
                bhour = closing_time - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = closing_time
                    opening_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                next_opening_time = self._next_opening_time(other + timedelta(seconds=1))
                bhour = next_opening_time - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = next_opening_time - timedelta(seconds=1)
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying the corrected version, the function should now handle adjustments for both positive and negative business hours correctly while taking holidays into account. The test case provided should pass as expected.
