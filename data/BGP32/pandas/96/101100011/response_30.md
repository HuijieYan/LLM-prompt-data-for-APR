### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class within the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is causing issues when used with `CustomBusinessHour` frequency with holidays specified. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` demonstrates the problem where the output contains more periods than expected when holidays are included.

The key issue seems to be the logic within the `apply` function that adjusts the input date based on the business hours. The adjustment process is not handling holidays correctly, leading to the unexpected behavior.

### Bug Location:
The problematic section in the `apply` function seems to be where it adjusts the input date `other` based on the business hours and handles the cases when the number of business days to adjust is not 0. This adjustment logic appears to be affected by the presence of holidays, causing the output to be incorrect.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function `apply` does not appropriately handle holidays when adjusting the input date based on the business hours. This leads to the incorrect number of periods being generated in the output when holidays are specified, as seen in the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the issue, the logic within the `apply` function needs to be revised to properly handle holidays during the adjustment process to ensure the correct number of periods in the output.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # reset to only date and time part
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # adjust by business days
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain

            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
                diff_to_next_opening = next_opening - other

                if n >= 0:
                    bhour_diff = min(bhour_remain, diff_to_next_opening)
                    other += bhour_diff
                    bhour_remain = max(timedelta(0), bhour_remain - diff_to_next_opening)
                else:
                    bhour_diff = min(bhour_remain, diff_to_next_opening)
                    other += bhour_diff
                    bhour_remain = max(timedelta(0), bhour_remain - diff_to_next_opening)
                    if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should address the issue raised in the failing test related to `CustomBusinessHour` frequency with holidays.
