### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is designed to apply a business hour offset to a given datetime object.
2. The issue reported on GitHub involves `pd.date_range` not working correctly when using periods and adding holidays with a custom business hour frequency.
3. The failing test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` provides a specific scenario where the buggy behavior can be observed.
4. The bug likely arises from the incorrect adjustment of business days and hours within the `apply` function.
5. The bug seems to lead to an incorrect calculation of business hours when incorporating holidays, causing the date_range to compute more periods than expected.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `apply` function causes incorrect adjustment of business days and hours when dealing with negative offsets and holidays, resulting in more periods generated by `pd.date_range` than expected.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper adjustment of business days and hours while considering offsets and holidays. The calculation for skipping business days and adjusting business hours needs to be revised to handle negative offsets correctly.

### Corrected Version:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # Other methods remain unchanged

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            holidays = getattr(self, "holidays", [])
            other_date = date(other.year, other.month, other.day)
            adjusted_other = other.replace(microsecond=0)

            if other in holidays:
                raise ApplyTypeError("Provided date is a holiday")

            # Adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                while adjusted_other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(adjusted_other):
                    adjusted_other = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_other)
            else:
                if adjusted_other.time() <= self.start:
                    adjusted_other = adjusted_other.replace(hour=self.start.hour, minute=0)
                if adjusted_other.time() in self.start and not self._is_on_offset(adjusted_other):
                    adjusted_other = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_other)
                    adjusted_other = self._get_closing_time(adjusted_other)

            # Adjust based on BusinessDay and remaining business hours
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), self._get_business_hours_by_sec(self.start, self.end) // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessHour(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(adjusted_other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_other)
                    remain = adjusted_other - prev_open
                    adjusted_other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    adjusted_other = adjusted_other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_other)) - adjusted_other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        adjusted_other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        adjusted_other = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_other) - adjusted_other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        adjusted_other += bhour
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                    else:
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

            return adjusted_other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function addresses the bugs related to handling negative offsets, holidays, and correctly calculating business days and hours. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test pass correctly.
