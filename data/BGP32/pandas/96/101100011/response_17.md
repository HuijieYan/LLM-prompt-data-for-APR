### Analysis:
- The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class contains logic to adjust the input datetime `other` based on business hours and holidays.
- The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is related to creating a date range with custom business hours and holidays using `pd.date_range`.
- The provided GitHub issue reports an error where adding holidays to custom business hours results in more periods being generated than expected.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Adjusting the input datetime based on business hours and holidays.
2. Calculating the total business hours by seconds in a day.
3. Handling adjustment for business days.
4. Adjusting remaining business hours based on the input datetime and business hours.

### Bug Cause:
The bug likely occurs due to improper handling of holidays in the calculation of business hours and adjustment logic within the `apply` function. The issue could be related to not correctly accounting for holidays when determining the number of periods to generate in the date range.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that holidays are properly integrated into the calculation of business hours and adjustment logic.
2. Adjust the logic for handling skip business days to consider holidays as well.
3. Verify that the adjustment based on business hours and remaining hours properly accounts for holidays.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessMixin, BusinessDay
from pandas._libs.tslibs.timestamps import Timestamp

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd, holidays=self.holidays)
                while not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other = other + skip_bd

            if n >= 0:
                while r != 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if r < bhour.total_seconds() // 60:
                        other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                        break
                    else:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                        r -= bhour.total_seconds() // 60
            else:
                while r != 0:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if r >= bhour.total_seconds() // 60:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
                        r -= bhour.total_seconds() // 60
                    else:
                        other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                        break

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### After the Fix:
After applying the above correction to the `apply` function, it should properly handle the adjustment of business hours, holidays, and periods in date ranges with custom business hours. This updated version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test scenario.
