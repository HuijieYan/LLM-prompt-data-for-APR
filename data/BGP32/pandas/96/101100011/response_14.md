### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class contains logic to adjust datetime based on business hour offsets.
2. The failing test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` from the test file expects a specific datetime index when using custom business hours with holidays.
3. The GitHub issue mentions that when using periods and holidays in `pd.date_range` with `CustomBusinessHour`, it produces unexpected results with more periods than expected.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `apply` function is likely related to the handling of holidays while adjusting the datetime based on business hour offsets. It fails to properly account for holidays in the calculation, resulting in incorrect datetime adjustments that lead to more periods than expected.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Identify the point where holiday handling should be incorporated in the logic.
2. Modify the logic to properly adjust the datetime considering holidays in the business hour offsets calculation.
3. Test the updated function with the failing test.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour, BusinessDay

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):

                if other.time() in end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in start:

                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:

                    if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and other.nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Note:
Make sure to import the necessary modules and adjust the function accordingly. This corrected version should address the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test function.
