### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is a method within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The method `apply` is designed to adjust a given datetime based on business hours, but it is failing in certain edge cases.
3. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in the `test_date_range.py` file demonstrates this bug by showcasing incorrect output when using periods and adding holidays.
4. The GitHub issue `Pandas date_range does not work when using periods and adding holiday` further elaborates on the problem faced and how it affects the functionality with holidays.
5. The root cause of the bug seems to be in the logic applied within the `apply` method, where adjustments for business days and hours are not handling holidays correctly, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function's logic for adjusting business days and hours does not properly account for holidays, causing the discrepancies in the output observed in the failing test. The function fails to adjust the given datetime correctly with holidays considered, resulting in extra periods in the date range.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to enhance the logic within the `apply` method to account for holidays when adjusting business days and hours. Proper handling of holidays and their impact on the datetime adjustments is crucial for accurate results.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessMixin, BusinessDay
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from pandas._libs.tslibs.offsets import ApplyTypeError


class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            # Adjust for holidays
            while not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            # Adjust business hours considering holidays
            while n > 0:
                if other.date() in self.holidays:
                    other = other + timedelta(hours=24)
                    continue

                bhour_remain = self._get_business_hours_by_sec(other, self.end)
                if bhour_remain >= n * 60:
                    return other + timedelta(minutes=n * 60)
                n -= bhour_remain / 60
                other = self.next_bday()._next_opening_time(other)
            
            return other

        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version of the `apply` method, we added logic to handle holidays appropriately when adjusting business days and hours. By ensuring the adjustments consider holidays, the function should now produce the correct output for scenarios involving periods and holidays, as described in the failing test.
