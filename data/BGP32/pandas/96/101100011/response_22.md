## Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class within the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is responsible for adjusting datetime objects based on business hours and handling business day offsets. The issue described in the GitHub problem leads to unexpected behavior when using `pd.date_range` with custom business hours and holidays.

## Identified Bugs:
1. The adjustment of business days seems incorrect, causing the mismatch in periods when holidays are present.
2. The business hour adjustment calculation appears to be flawed, resulting in an incorrect number of periods returned.

## Bug Cause:
The bug stems from incorrect calculations while adjusting business days and hours in the `apply` function. When holidays are added, the adjustment logic does not properly handle the skip of business days and remaining business hours, leading to an incorrect result.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the logic for skipping business days when holidays are present to ensure the correct count of periods.
2. Fix the calculation of remaining business hours to accurately adjust the datetime objects.

## Bug-fixed Function:
```python

        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

            )

            bd, remaining = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours_sec // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, remaining = -bd, -remaining

            if bd != 0:

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):

                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:

                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))
                        )

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Applying the corrected logic within the `apply` function should resolve the issue reported on GitHub by handling business days and hours adjustments accurately.

After incorporating the fixed function, running the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` should now produce the expected output and pass successfully. This fix should address the unexpected behavior when using custom business hours and holidays with `pd.date_range`.
