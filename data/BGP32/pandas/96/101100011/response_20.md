### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `offsets.py` file is responsible for adjusting datetime objects based on business hours.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in the `test_date_range.py` file demonstrates the issue when using custom business hours and holidays in `pd.date_range`.
3. The GitHub issue describes a similar problem where `pd.date_range` produces unexpected results when using periods and adding holidays.
4. The bug likely occurs due to incorrect adjustments of business days and hours within the `apply` function, leading to incorrect datetime generation.
5. The fix involves correcting the logic within the `apply` function to handle business days, business hours, and holiday skipping accurately.

### Proposed Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Improve the logic for adjusting business days and hours within the `apply` function.
2. Ensure correct handling of holidays and business hours to generate datetime objects accurately.
3. Test the fixed function to verify that it resolves the issue reported in the GitHub bug.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
        
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    while other.time() not in self.end:
                        other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            
            skip_days = n // len(self.start)
            remain_days = n % len(self.start)
            
            for _ in range(abs(skip_days)):
                if skip_days > 0:
                    other = self.next_bday.apply(other)
                else:
                    other = self.next_bday.apply(other, -1)
            
            remaining_hours = remain_days * 60
            
            while remaining_hours > 0:
                closing_time = self._get_closing_time(other)
                time_diff = (closing_time - other).seconds // 60
                if remaining_hours >= time_diff:
                    other = closing_time
                    remaining_hours -= time_diff
                else:
                    other += timedelta(minutes=remaining_hours)
                    break
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying the above fix and running the failing test, the corrected version should pass the test and resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug.
