### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is causing the issue with the `CustomBusinessHour` offset when used with the `date_range` function. The function is incorrectly handling the adjustment of business days and business hours, leading to incorrect results when holidays are involved.

### Error Locations:
The following areas are potential error locations in the buggy function:
1. Adjustment of business days
2. Calculation of remaining business hours to adjust
3. Handling of business hours left in each interval
4. Comparison and adjustment logic within the while loops

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by incorrect logic in adjusting both business days and business hours within the `apply` function. This results in the unexpected behavior when holidays are considered because the function is not correctly accounting for holiday dates.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustment of business days and business hours accounts for holidays and correctly handles the remaining hours to adjust. Additionally, the comparisons and adjustments within the while loops need to be refined to produce the expected output.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
After considering the issues in the original implementation, here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# Assuming the import for ApplyTypeError is available in the environment
from pandas._libs.tslibs.offsets import ApplyTypeError

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # Other functions in the class remain the same

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                    
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and other.nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With these adjustments, the corrected version of the `apply` function should now handle holidays correctly in combination with the `CustomBusinessHour` offset when used in the `date_range` function, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
