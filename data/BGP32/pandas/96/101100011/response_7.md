### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is causing the issue in the test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.
2. The issue seems to arise from the incorrect adjustment of dates when handling business hours and holidays.
3. The failing test case in the GitHub issue demonstrates that when using periods and adding holidays, the `date_range` function produces more periods than expected due to incorrect date adjustments.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments made in the `apply` function correctly handle holidays and business hours to avoid the extra periods in the result.

### Correction:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other += skip_bd
            
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                else:
                    bhour = other - self._get_closing_time(other)
                
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    if n >= 0 and not self.is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain -= bhour_remain
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Applying this correction should address the bug and ensure that the `date_range` function works correctly when using periods and adding holidays with custom business hours.
