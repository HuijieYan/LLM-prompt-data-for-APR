### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` inside the `BusinessHourMixin` class is used to adjust datetime values based on business hours. It is failing to behave correctly in scenarios involving custom business hours with holidays.
2. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when using `pd.date_range` with custom business hours and holidays, the output periods are incorrect, producing more than expected. This aligns with the buggy behavior observed in the `apply` function.
3. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles holidays and adjusts business hours while calculating the datetime values. The incorrect adjustment logic within the function seems to be causing the extra periods in the output.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `apply` function correctly handles holidays and adjusts business hours without introducing extra periods in the output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Revise the logic for adjusting the datetime values based on business hours and holidays.
2. Ensure that the adjustment calculation considers holidays and maintains the expected number of periods in the output.
3. Check for boundary conditions where the adjustment might go wrong due to incorrect handling of holidays.
4. Refactor the logic to address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if isinstance(other, date):
            other = datetime.combine(other, datetime.min.time())
        
        # Adjust for holidays
        if self.holidays and other.date() in self.holidays:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        
        n = self.n
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)

            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Applying the corrected version of the `apply` function should resolve the bug and make it behave correctly for scenarios involving custom business hours with holidays.
