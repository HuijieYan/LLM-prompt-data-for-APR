### Analysis:
- The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is causing incorrect behavior when combining business hours with datetime objects.
- The issue reported on GitHub highlights a scenario where using periods along with holidays in `pd.date_range` leads to unexpected results.

### Bugs:
1. The adjustment of `other` based on business hours is not taking into account holidays or skipping business days correctly.
2. This leads to the incorrect calculation of periods when holidays are involved, causing more than the specified number of periods.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the calculations consider holidays and adjust `other` correctly based on the working hours and holiday schedule.
2. Modify the logic of adjusting the datetime object to align with the expected behavior when using holidays in date ranges.

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `apply` function adjusted the logic to handle holidays correctly when calculating business hours. This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure the expected behavior when using periods along with holidays in `pd.date_range`.
