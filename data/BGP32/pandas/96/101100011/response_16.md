### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class of `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` is responsible for adjusting the input datetime based on business hours.
2. The issue in the GitHub report indicates that when using `pd.date_range` with `periods` and adding holidays, the output is incorrect, producing more periods than expected.
3. The bug in the function is likely related to the logic of adjusting the input datetime when holidays are involved, causing the incorrect number of periods in the output.
4. The failing test provided with the example of `CustomBusinessHour` with a holiday highlights this issue.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function `apply` does not correctly handle the adjustment of dates when holidays are involved. When adjusting the input datetime for business hours within the `apply` function, the logic for handling holidays is incorrect, leading to an incorrect number of periods being generated in the output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the adjustment of input datetime in the `apply` function correctly handles holidays and maintains the expected number of periods during the adjustment process.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Check if the date is a holiday, and adjust accordingly
            while self._get_closing_time(other).date() in getattr(self, "holidays", []) or (
                other.time() not in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other)
            ):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                
            n = self.n
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By updating the `apply` function to correctly handle adjustment for holidays, the corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
