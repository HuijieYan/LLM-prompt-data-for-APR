## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is supposed to adjust datetime objects based on business hours and holidays.
2. The function seems to be incorrectly handling the adjustment logic for the business hours, resulting in an incorrect number of periods when holidays are included.
3. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` demonstrates the issue where the number of periods generated is incorrect when holidays are included.
4. The GitHub issue describes a similar problem where adding holidays causes unexpected behavior in generating periods using `pd.date_range`.

## Bug Cause:
The buggy function does not properly adjust the datetime objects when holidays are included, leading to an incorrect number of periods being generated in the frequency. This issue arises due to the logic for adjusting business days and business hours in the function.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments for business days and business hours are correctly handled, especially when holidays are involved. The logic for calculating the business days and remaining business hours needs to be adjusted to accommodate holidays and prevent the unexpected behavior observed in the failing test.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# Updated buggy function with bug fix
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        n = self.n
        adjusted_dt = other
        if n >= 0:
            while n > 0:
                adjusted_dt = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_dt)
                if self._is_on_offset(adjusted_dt):
                    n -= 1
        else:
            while n < 0:
                adjusted_dt = self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_dt)
                if self._is_on_offset(adjusted_dt):
                    n += 1
        
        return adjusted_dt
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the logic for handling business days and business hours, this corrected version of the buggy function should now accurately adjust datetime objects based on business hours and holidays, ensuring that the failing test passes and the issue described on GitHub is resolved.
