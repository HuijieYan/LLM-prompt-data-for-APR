## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` inside the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `offsets.py` file is responsible for handling business hours adjustments but fails when combined with holidays in the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in `test_date_range.py` showcases the issue where periods are not correctly handled when holidays are introduced.
3. The GitHub issue describes a similar problem where adding holidays causes more periods in the output than expected.

## Bug:
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of adjustment for holidays within the `apply` function. When adjusting for holidays, the function does not properly handle the scenario where a holiday falls within the specified periods, resulting in additional periods being added beyond the expected count.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic within the `apply` function to correctly adjust for holidays and ensure that the number of periods generated matches the expected output.

## Correction:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if not isinstance(other, datetime):
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
        
        result = []
        current = other
        for _ in range(self.n):
            while not self._is_on_offset(current) or current.time() in self.start:
                current = self._next_opening_time(current)
            
            while self._get_closing_time(current) in result or self._is_on_offset(current):
                current = self._next_opening_time(current)
            
            if current not in result:
                result.append(current)
        return result[-1]
``` 

With this correction, the `apply` function should now correctly handle adjustments for holidays while generating the desired number of periods based on the input.
