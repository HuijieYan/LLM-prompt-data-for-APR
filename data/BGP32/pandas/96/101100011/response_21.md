### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is a method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas.tseries.offsets` module. This function is used to apply custom business hours logic to a given datetime object.

The test case that is failing is related to the usage of custom business hours to generate a date range with specific periods. The bug causes the date range to be generated incorrectly when holidays are included.

### Bug Location:
The bug seems to be related to the calculation of business hours and adjustments made to the datetime object based on the custom business hour logic.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function mishandles the adjustment of the datetime object `other` when dealing with negative business hours. This leads to incorrect calculations and results in the date range being generated with more than the expected number of periods.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments made to the datetime object are correct and accurately reflect the custom business hour logic, especially in cases where the business hours are negative.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            if n >= 0:
                while n != 0:
                    if n > 0:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                        n -= 1
                    else:
                        other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                        n += 1

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version includes the adjustment of the datetime object according to the custom business hour logic in a more accurate manner, ensuring that the date range is generated correctly even when holidays are included.

### Summary:
By correcting the adjustment logic in the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas.tseries.offsets` module, the issue related to date ranges generated with custom business hours and holidays should be resolved.
