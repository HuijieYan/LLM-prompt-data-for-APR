### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The function is applied when combining business hours with datetime objects.
3. The bug causes unexpected behavior when using periods with a custom business hour frequency that includes holidays. It leads to extra periods being generated, as reported in the GitHub issue.
4. The issue seems to be related to how the function handles adjusting for holidays within the given number of periods. A logic flaw in adjusting the business days and hours might be causing the extra periods to be generated.
5. To fix the bug, the adjustment logic within the function needs to be carefully reviewed and modified to ensure correct handling of holidays and business hours.

### Correction:
```python
from pandas._libs.tslibs.offsets import BusinessDay

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                for _ in range(abs(n)):
                    while not self.next_bday().is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self.next_bday().rollforward(other)
                        if self._is_on_offset(other):
                            break
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                for _ in range(abs(n)):
                    while self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                        other -= BusinessDay(n=1)

            return other

        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Conclusion:
By modifying the adjustment logic within the `apply` function to correctly handle holidays and business hour increments/decrements, the corrected version should now address the bug reported in the failing test and the related GitHub issue. This fix aims to provide the expected behavior when using periods with a custom business hour frequency that includes holidays.
