## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class seems to be responsible for the incorrect behavior when using `pd.date_range` with custom business hours and holidays.
2. The bug seems to be related to the handling of business days and adjusting the datetime based on business hours in the presence of holidays.
3. The issue reported on GitHub confirms that when using periods and adding holidays, the number of periods generated by `pd.date_range` is not as expected.
4. The bug seems to be caused by incorrect adjustments for holidays and business hours in the `apply` function.
5. To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic of adjusting the datetime based on business hours and ensure correct handling of holidays.

## Correction:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            start = self.start[0]
            end = self.end[0]
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() >= end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() < start:
                    other = other.replace(hour=start.hour, minute=start.minute, second=0, microsecond=0)
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n), len(self.start))
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            bd_time = skip_bd + timedelta(hours=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() >= end:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = other.replace(hour=start.hour, minute=start.minute, second=0, microsecond=0)
                while bd_time > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_business_hours_by_sec(self.start, self.end)
                    if bd_time <= bhour:
                        other += bd_time
                        break
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    bd_time -= bhour
            else:
                if other.time() < start:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                while bd_time < timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_business_hours_by_sec(self.start, self.end)
                    if bd_time >= -bhour:
                        other += bd_time
                        break
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    bd_time += bhour
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making the adjustments described in the corrected `apply` function, the bug should be fixed, and the `pd.date_range` with custom business hours and holidays should work correctly as expected.
