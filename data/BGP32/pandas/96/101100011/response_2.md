### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is responsible for adjusting business hours based on a given datetime. The issue reported on GitHub mentions that when using periods and adding holidays, the `pd.date_range` function produces more periods than expected.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Adjustment of `other` datetime based on business hours.
2. Calculation of business hours.
3. Handling of negative `n` values.
4. Adjustment of business days.

### Bug Cause:
The bug may be caused by incorrect adjustments in the `apply` function when accounting for holidays and business hours. The discrepancy in the number of periods observed in the failing test may stem from incorrect calculations during the adjustment process.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the adjustments made to the given datetime need to be carefully reviewed. Ensure that holidays are properly accounted for and that the business hour calculations are accurate when determining the number of periods.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            for holiday in self.holidays:
                if holiday.date() < other.date():
                    n -= 1
    
            if n >= 0:
                while n > 0 and (other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other)):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    n -= 1
            else:
                while n < 0:
                    if other.time() in self.start:
                        other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                    if self._is_on_offset(other):
                        n += 1
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
    
            if n == 0:
                return other
    
            # Calculate business hours
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                other += BusinessDay(n=bd)
    
            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            # Adjust remaining business hours
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other += bhour
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                    else:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(seconds=0)
            else:
                while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                    bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other -= bhour
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                    else:
                        other -= bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(seconds=0)
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the `pd.date_range` function works correctly with periods and holidays.
