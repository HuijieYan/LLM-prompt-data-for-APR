### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `offsets.py` file is used for adjusting business hours based on the given datetime object. The user reported issue on GitHub indicates that when using the `pd.date_range` function with custom holidays and periods, the output is incorrect.

#### Potential Error Locations:
1. Adjusting the datetime object `other` to reduce the number of cases.
2. Incorrect adjustment of business days and remaining business hours.
3. Incorrect handling of edge conditions.
4. Logic for adjusting business hours within each business time interval.

#### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be related to how the `apply` function adjusts the datetime object for business hours, especially when dealing with custom holidays and periods. The incorrect adjustments within the function lead to unexpected behavior in the output of `pd.date_range`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure correct adjustments of the `other` datetime object based on the given business hours and holidays.
2. Verify the logic for adjusting business days and remaining hours.
3. Handle edge cases and conditions properly to avoid unexpected output.
4. Debug the function with test cases involving custom holidays and periods to ensure correct behavior.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if hasattr(other, "hour") and hasattr(other, "minute"):
            n = self.n
            is_negative = n < 0

            if is_negative:
                start_time = other.replace(hour=self.start[0].hour, minute=self.start[0].minute)
                if self._is_on_offset(start_time) and start_time.time() == self.start[0].time():
                    other = start_time + timedelta(seconds=1)

            while n != 0:
                if n > 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    if self._is_on_offset(other):
                        n -= 1
                else:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                        n += 1

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Applying these corrections to the `apply` function should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure accurate adjustments of business hours when using custom holidays with the `pd.date_range` function. Additionally, running the failing test function after making these corrections should confirm that the bug has been fixed.
