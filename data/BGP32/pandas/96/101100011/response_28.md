### Analyzing the buggy function and related information:

1. The buggy function is the `apply` method in the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas.tseries.offsets` module.
2. The function is intended to adjust a given datetime based on business hours and holidays.
3. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when using the `date_range` function with `periods` and adding holidays, it produces unexpected results.
4. The failing test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` demonstrates this behavior with the use case provided.
5. The bug seems to be related to how the adjustment of business days and hours is handled within the `apply` function.

### Identifying potential error locations:

1. The calculation for adjusting the datetime by business days and remaining business hours seems to be the primary area where the bug might be present.
2. The logic to handle edge cases when adjusting for negative business days appears to be a potential source of the issue.
3. The way the `bhour_remain` variable is updated and utilized to adjust the datetime within the loops could also be a point of concern.

### Cause of the bug:

The bug seems to stem from the incorrect adjustment of business days and remaining business hours within the `apply` function. This leads to the unexpected behavior observed when using `date_range` with periods and holidays.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:

1. Ensure that the adjustment for both positive and negative business days is handled correctly.
2. Verify that the remaining business hours are adjusted properly within the loops.
3. Check if the logic for determining the end time of business hours and the calculation of `bhour_remain` is accurate.

### Corrected version of the `apply` function:

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other -= timedelta(1)
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
            
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            remain = other - prev_open
            other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
        
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                other += min(bhour, bhour_remain)
                bhour_remain -= min(bhour, bhour_remain)
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version focuses on properly adjusting the datetime for business days and remaining business hours, ensuring the expected behavior when using `date_range` with periods and holidays.
