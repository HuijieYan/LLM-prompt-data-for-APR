### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply(self, other)` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is responsible for handling the application of business hours offsets to datetime objects.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in the test file checks the behavior of `pd.date_range` with custom business hours and holidays.
3. The GitHub issue reports a specific scenario where using `pd.date_range` with both periods and holidays results in unexpected behavior, producing more than the specified number of periods due to the buggy behavior.
4. The issue seems to be related to how holidays are processed in conjunction with the business hour offsets within the `apply` function.

### Bug:
The bug is likely in the calculation of the adjusted datetime when holidays are involved, leading to an incorrect number of periods being generated.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments for holidays are correctly handled while applying the business hour offsets to the datetime objects.

This corrected version addresses the issues related to holiday adjustments and should now pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
