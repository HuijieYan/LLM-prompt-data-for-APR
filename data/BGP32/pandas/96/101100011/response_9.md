### Analysis:
1. The function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is the buggy function.
2. The buggy function is meant to adjust datetime objects based on business hours and offsets. The issue seems to be related to how holidays are handled within the function.
3. The failing test is related to creating a date range with custom business hours and holidays, which results in unexpected behavior.
4. The issue on GitHub also describes a similar problem where adding holidays to the date range with periods results in more periods generated than expected.
5. The cause of the bug seems to be improper handling of holidays in the `apply` function when adjusting datetime objects within business hours.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `apply` function to properly handle holidays when adjusting datetime objects based on business hours and offsets.
2. Check for holidays in the adjustment logic and ensure that the adjusted datetime objects skip holidays accordingly.
3. Update the logic inside the function to correctly adjust for holidays and maintain the expected behavior when generating date ranges with custom business hours and holidays.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            original_other = other

            if isinstance(other, date):
                other = datetime.combine(other, datetime.min.time())

            if n >= 0:
                while n > 0:
                    if other.hour in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                        if getattr(self, 'holidays', None):
                            while other in self.holidays:
                                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                        n -= 1
            else:
                while n < 0:
                    if other.hour in self.start:
                        other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                    elif self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    if getattr(self, 'holidays', None):
                        while other in self.holidays:
                            other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                            if other.hour in self.start:
                                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                    n += 1

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function should now properly handle holidays when adjusting datetime objects based on business hours and offsets. It ensures that the adjusted datetime objects skip holidays as needed.
