### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is responsible for adjusting the datetime based on business hour offsets.
2. The bug seems to be related to handling holidays while adjusting the datetime.
3. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` highlights the issue where adding holidays causes more periods than expected in the `pd.date_range` output.
4. The bug seems to be caused by incorrect handling of holidays when adjusting the datetime based on business hour offsets.
5. To fix the bug, the adjustment logic needs to correctly handle holidays to avoid overadjustment.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic within the `apply` function to properly handle holidays when adjusting the datetime.
2. Consider the holiday dates when calculating the adjustment to ensure the number of periods is accurate.
3. Update the adjustment process based on holidays to align the periods correctly in the output.
4. Ensure that the adjustment does not include any duplicate or unnecessary periods when holidays are present.

By correctly considering holidays in the adjustment process, the corrected version of the `apply` function should now produce the expected output for `pd.date_range` with custom holidays.
