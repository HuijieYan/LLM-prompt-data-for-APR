### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The function is designed to apply business hours to a given datetime object.
3. The issue reported on GitHub describes a scenario where using the `CustomBusinessHour` offset with holidays while generating a date range using `pd.date_range` results in unexpected behavior.
4. The failing test function for the issue highlights the problem by comparing the expected date range with actual results.
5. The cause of the bug seems to be related to how the `apply` function handles business day adjustments and holidays.

### Bug:
The bug in the `apply` function arises due to incorrect handling of business days and holidays, leading to unexpected results when generating a date range with `CustomBusinessHour` offset and holidays.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `apply` function to properly account for business days and holidays, ensuring that the date adjustments are accurate.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from pandas.tseries.frequencies import CustomBusinessHour
import pandas as pd
import pandas._libs.lib as lib

class BusinessHourMixin:
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            start_times = sorted(self.start)
            end_times = sorted(self.end)
            end_times += [end_times[0]]  # Close the loop for calculating next opening time
    
            all_hours = [(st, en) for st, en in zip(start_times, end_times)]
            business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in all_hours)
    
            bd, r = divmod(n * business_hours // 60, business_hours // 60)
    
            offset = timedelta(hours=bd*24)
            other = other + offset
    
            for _ in range(abs(r)):
                current_hour = other.hour
                current_minute = other.minute
    
                can_move_forward = 1 if n >= 0 else 0
                offset = pd.Timedelta(0, unit='h')
    
                attempts = 0
                while True:
                    attempts += 1
                    # Handle being at the opening hour already
                    if (current_hour, current_minute) not in start_times:
                        other = other + offset
                        break
                    
                    is_on_holiday = lib.map_infer(other.timestamp(), self.holidays)
                    if is_on_holiday:
                        offset += pd.DateOffset(hours=24 * can_move_forward)
                    else:
                        other = other + offset
                        break
    
                    if attempts > business_hours * 4:
                        raise ValueError("Could not adjust to business hour due to conflicting offset and holidays.")
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function should address the bug and ensure that the date adjustments with business hours and holidays are handled accurately.
