### Analysis
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class has issues in the logic of adjusting the business hours when dealing with custom business hours like holidays. This leads to incorrect results and the failing test case.

### Issues in the Buggy Function
1. Incorrect handling of holidays and adjustment of business hours causes the function to add extra periods in certain scenarios.
2. The logic for adjusting business hours based on direction (positive or negative) of `n` is flawed.
3. The business hours are not correctly adjusted when passing a custom business hour frequency with start time and holidays.

### Bug Cause
The buggy function fails due to incorrect handling of holidays in the logic of applying business hours. When holidays are present, periods are not adjusted correctly, leading to unexpected results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Adjust the logic for handling holidays and business hour adjustments.
2. Ensure correct handling of business hour directions to avoid extra periods.
3. Modify the function to correctly apply business hours considering holidays.

### Corrected Function
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        # adjust by business hours
        while n != 0:
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                if self._is_on_offset(other):
                    n -= 1 if n > 0 else 1

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying this corrected version of the function, it should handle the holidays and business hour adjustments correctly, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
