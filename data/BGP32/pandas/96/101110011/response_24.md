### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is designed to adjust a given datetime according to business hour offsets. The function handles adjustments based on the provided datetime and the business hours defined by `self.start` and `self.end`.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is related to using custom business hours with holidays and generating date ranges. The test calls `pd.date_range` with a custom business hour and expects the correct date range with the provided holidays.
3. The error message indicates a `ValueError` in the `_validate_frequency` method of `DatetimeArray`. This error occurs during frequency validation, where the inferred frequency does not align with the passed frequency in the given custom business hour setup.
4. The bug is likely in how the adjustments are made within the `apply` function when handling negative offsets and holiday-related cases. The inconsistency arises when calculating business hours and adjusting for specific offsets.
5. To fix the bug, adjustments need to be made regarding how holidays are incorporated, calculations related to negative offsets, and ensuring correct alignment with the frequency of the custom business hours provided.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check and modify the logic used to adjust the datetime based on the provided business hours.
2. Ensure that holiday dates are appropriately handled within the adjustments.
3. Revise the calculation for negative offsets to align with the expected behavior for custom business hours.
4. Verify that the adjustments match the frequency requirements of the custom business hour setup.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self.next_bday.apply(other)
                for i in range(abs(bd) - 1):
                    other = self.next_bday.apply(other)

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other if n >= 0 else self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other) if n >= 0 else self._next_opening_time(other)
                    bhour_remain -= bhour

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function should handle adjustments for business hours, holidays, and negative offsets correctly to align with the expected behavior, resolving the issue outlined in the failing test and the GitHub report.
