## Analysis
The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is supposed to adjust datetime values based on business hours and holidays. However, the issue arises when holidays are involved, causing unexpected behavior and incorrect results.

The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is meant to create a date range using a custom business hour frequency with holidays specified. The expected output does not match the actual output due to the buggy behavior of the `apply` method.

The error message indicates a `ValueError` being raised during frequency validation, stating that the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency. This points to a problem with how the business hours are being applied, potentially due to holidays being considered incorrectly.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by how holidays are handled in the `apply` method when adjusting datetime values. The incorrect adjustment leads to more periods than expected, resulting in an incorrect date range generation.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that holidays are properly considered when adjusting datetime values within the business hours. Correct handling of holidays should result in the expected behavior when creating a date range with custom business hours and holidays.

## Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` method within the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            offset_datetime = True
            if sys.version_info < (3, 7):
                other = datetime(
                    other.year,
                    other.month,
                    other.day,
                    other.hour,
                    other.minute,
                    other.second,
                    other.microsecond,
                )
                offset_datetime = False
    
            # adjust datetime based on business hours and holidays
            holiday_dates = getattr(self, "holidays", set())
            holidays = {date(d.year, d.month, d.day) for d in holiday_dates}
    
            if n >= 0:
                while other.date() in holidays or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                while other.date() in holidays or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other, sign=-1)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            if not offset_datetime:
                other = as_datetime(other)
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, we handle holidays within the adjustment loop to ensure that the correct opening times are used when holidays are encountered. This modification should resolve the issue and make the date range generation with custom business hours and holidays work as expected.
