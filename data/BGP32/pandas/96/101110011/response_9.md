### Bug Analysis:
- The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is trying to create a date range with custom business hours and holidays. The issue is related to mismatched frequencies when holidays are involved.
- The error message suggests that the bug lies in how the frequency validation is conducted in the `CustomBusinessHour` class. The frequency inferred from the input does not match the specified frequency, causing the validation error.

### Error Location:
- The issue most likely originates from the mismatch between inferred frequency and passed frequency in the `CustomBusinessHour` implementation.
- The error triggers the `ValueError` in the `_validate_frequency` method of the `DatetimeArray` class.

### Bug Cause:
- The mismatch between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency is disrupting the creation of the date range with custom business hours.
- This mismatch is causing the `ValueError` when validating the frequency, leading to unexpected behavior in generating the date range with holidays.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Ensure that the passed frequency aligns with the inferred frequency during date range creation with custom business hours and holidays.
- Adjust the frequency handling in the `CustomBusinessHour` class to account for holidays and maintain compatibility with the inferred frequency.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class CustomBusinessHour(pd.tseries.offsets.BusinessHourMixin, pd.tseries.offsets.BusinessDayMixin):
    def __init__(self, start='09:00', end='17:00', holidays=None):
        self.start = _to_dt64(start)
        self.end = _to_dt64(end)
        self.holidays = [pd.Timestamp(h) for h in holidays] if holidays else []

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, other.hour, other.minute, other.second, other.microsecond)
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)

                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)

                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Now, after updating the `CustomBusinessHour` class, the corrected function should handle holidays correctly without causing the frequency mismatch issue. This fix should resolve the failing test and the GitHub issue related to creating date ranges with custom business hours and holidays.
