### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is a method that is intended to adjust a datetime object based on custom business hours. The issue seems to stem from the handling of business days and business hours within the function, leading to incorrect adjustments that are causing the failing test.

### Identified Issue:
The bug is likely related to incorrect adjustment of business days and remaining business hours within the `apply` function. This results in unexpected behaviors when calculating the new datetime based on custom business hours.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function is not correctly handling the adjustment of business days and remaining business hours, causing the incorrect output in the failing test. The mismanagement of business days and hours calculation results in unexpected datetime increments or decrements.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure the correct adjustment of business days and remaining business hours within the `apply` function. Proper calculation and adjustment logic for business days and hours based on the given custom business hours are crucial for the corrected function.

### Corrected Function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            bd = n // len(self.start)  # Calculate full business days to adjust
    
            # Skip non-business days if necessary
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = self.next_bday(other)
                other = other + skip_bd
    
            r = n % len(self.start)  # Remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r * 60)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self.next_bday(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                        other = other + bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self.next_bday(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain < timedelta(0):
                    bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other = other + bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain += bhour
                        other = self._prev_opening_time(self._get_closing_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function implements the proper handling of business days and remaining business hours based on the given custom business hours. It should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
