### Analysis:
1. The buggy function in the `BusinessHourMixin` class named `apply` is causing the error.
2. The error is due to incorrect adjustments made in the `apply` function while handling business hours with datetime objects.
3. The error results in the `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` test case failing with a `ValueError` because the periods are not correctly calculated when holidays are involved.
4. The bug is related to the incorrect handling of business days and holiday dates in the `apply` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect handling of business days, holiday dates, and adjustments within the `apply` function. It fails to correctly calculate the business hours within specified periods when holidays are involved, leading to unexpected results and additional periods being added.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the adjustments for business days and holidays are accurately accounted for within the function to correctly calculate the periods without considering holidays as valid business hours.
2. Correctly adjust the datetime objects based on business days and remaining business hours within the periods.
3. Ensure that the adjustments made cover all edge cases and accurately manage business hours with holidays.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # adjust by business days first
            skip = timedelta(days=1)
    
            if bd != 0:
                if n < 0 and not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                while bd != 0:
                    while not self.is_on_offset(other):
                        other += skip
                    bd -= 1
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other) if bd != 0 else other
    
            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    bhour_remain -= self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    bhour_remain += other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### After applying this correction, the `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` should pass successfully without errors.
