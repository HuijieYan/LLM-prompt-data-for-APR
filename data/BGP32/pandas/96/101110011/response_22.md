### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is responsible for handling business hours adjustments. The function takes in a `datetime` object and adjusts it based on the business hour settings.
2. The failing test revolves around creating a date range with a custom business hour frequency and a holiday included. The issue arises when using `periods` parameter instead of specifying the `end` date directly.
3. The error message hints at a problem with the validation of frequency when generating the date range. This indicates a discrepancy between the inferred frequency and the specified frequency.
4. The bug seems to be related to how the business hours are calculated and adjusted within the `apply` function.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the date range generation with custom business hours and holidays to produce an unexpected number of periods when using the `periods` parameter. This discrepancy occurs due to improper handling of adjusting the date based on business hours in the `apply` function.
   
### Suggested Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the adjustments in the `apply` function related to business hours calculation and holiday handling need to be reviewed and corrected. Ensure that the adjustments made align with the specific business hour settings and account for holidays properly.
   
### Corrected Version:
```python
# Import necessary functions for the correction
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay

# Corrected version of the buggy function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            # Adjust the comparison for business hours timing
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() >= self.end[0] or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() <= self.start[0]:
                    # Move to the previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(days=1)
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # Calculate the total business hours in a day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            # Business day adjustments
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = self.next_bday.apply(other + skip_bd)

            # Remaining business hours adjustment
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = (
                        self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    )
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

                if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By fixing the comparison logic related to business hours' start and end timings, as well as adjusting how the dates are processed based on business hours and holidays, the corrected function should now handle the date adjustments correctly in the provided test case.
