### Analysis:
- The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is responsible for adjusting timestamps based on business hours and offsets.
- The function processes the provided datetime input to align it with the specified business hours.
- The error in this function can lead to incorrect adjustments and misalignment of business hours, leading to unexpected results.
- The failing test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` highlights the issue with creating date ranges using `CustomBusinessHour` offsets with holidays. The current behavior is producing incorrect periods in the output.
- The error message from the failing test indicates a failure in validating the frequency of the date range, specifically related to the `CustomBusinessHour` settings.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug seems to be related to the incorrect adjustment of business hours and offsets within the `apply` function, leading to the misalignment of timestamps.
- The incorrect handling of provided holidays and offsets is likely causing the date range to produce unexpected results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Ensure that the adjustments made in the `apply` function correctly align the timestamps with the specified business hours and offsets.
- Take special care when handling holidays to ensure they are correctly factored into the date range generation.
- Verify that the logic for adjusting timestamps based on positive and negative business days is correct and covers edge cases adequately.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class:
```python
# Fixed version of the buggy function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            start = self.start
            end = self.end

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(start, end))

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday().is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying this correction, the function should produce the expected results for the provided failing test case.
