### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` within the class `BusinessHourMixin` in the `offsets.py` file of pandas module.
2. The function takes another datetime object as input and applies some business hour adjustments to it.
3. The error message indicates a mismatch in the inferred frequency during validation.
4. The issue on GitHub highlights the problem when using periods along with holidays in the `pd.date_range` function.
   
### Bug Explanation:
The bug likely stems from incorrect handling of the datetime calculations based on business hours and the presence of holidays. This leads to incorrect adjustments and ultimately results in the mismatch of the inferred frequency.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Review the logic for adjusting the input datetime based on business hours and handling holidays.
2. Ensure that the adjustments are made correctly taking into account the specified business hour constraints and holidays.
3. Validate the inferred frequency accurately to match the expected behavior when using periods and holidays together.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        
        new_ts = other.replace(microsecond=0)
        new_ts = new_ts.replace(second=0)
        business_days_seconds = sum(((en - st).total_seconds() for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)))
        
        if n >= 0:
            while n > 0:
                new_ts += timedelta(seconds=1)
                if new_ts.time() in self.start:
                    n -= 1
        else:
            while n < 0:
                new_ts -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if new_ts.time() in self.end:
                    n += 1
        
        business_day_offset = n // business_days_seconds
        remaining_seconds = n % business_days_seconds
        
        new_ts += timedelta(days=business_day_offset)
        
        while remaining_seconds != 0:
            day_start = self._next_opening_time(new_ts)
            business_duration = self._get_business_hours_by_sec(self.start[0], self.end[0])
            if n >= 0:
                closing_time = self._get_closing_time(day_start)
                time_remaining = closing_time - new_ts
                if time_remaining.total_seconds() < remaining_seconds:
                    new_ts = closing_time
                else:
                    new_ts += timedelta(seconds=remaining_seconds)
                    remaining_seconds = 0
            else:
                next_open_time = self._next_opening_time(new_ts + timedelta(seconds=1))
                time_remaining = next_open_time - new_ts
                if time_remaining.total_seconds() >= abs(remaining_seconds):
                    new_ts += timedelta(seconds=remaining_seconds)
                    remaining_seconds = 0
                else:
                    new_ts = next_open_time
                
        return new_ts
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function should address the issue and ensure that the adjustments based on business hours and holidays are calculated correctly.
