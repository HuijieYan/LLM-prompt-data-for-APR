### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class, located in `pandas/tseries/offsets.py`.
2. The function is called by `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in the context of custom business hours, which is causing unexpected behavior.
3. The error message indicates a mismatch between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency, leading to an incorrect number of periods being generated.
4. The issue on GitHub highlights the problem when using periods and holidays in `pd.date_range` with custom business hours.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the `apply` function within `BusinessHourMixin` does not handle custom business hours with holidays correctly. It causes the date range generation to include additional periods due to incompatibility between the inferred and passed frequencies.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, ensure that the behavior aligns with the expected output in custom business hours scenario with holidays. The `apply` function should adjust the generation of date ranges accordingly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if not self._is_on_offset(other) or other.time() in self.end:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            workdays = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(start, end) for start, end in zip(self.start, self.end))
            full_bdays, remaining_mins = divmod(abs(n * 60), workdays // 60)

            if n < 0:
                full_bdays, remaining_mins = -full_bdays, -remaining_mins
            
            # Adjust by complete business days first
            if full_bdays != 0:
                skip_days = BusinessDay(n=full_bdays)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    proximity_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remaining = other - proximity_open
                    other = proximity_open + skip_days + remaining
                else:
                    other += skip_days
            
            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            remaining_hours = timedelta(minutes=remaining_mins)
    
            while remaining_hours != timedelta(0):
                business_hours = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other if n >= 0 \
                    else self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if remaining_hours >= business_hours or (remaining_hours == business_hours and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0):
                    other += remaining_hours
                    remaining_hours = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    remaining_hours -= business_hours
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + business_hours) if n >= 0 \
                        else self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + business_hours - timedelta(seconds=1))
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Apply the corrected version of the `apply` function to mitigate the issue with generating date ranges using custom business hours and holidays in `pd.date_range`.
