### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `offsets.py` file is meant to adjust datetime objects based on business hours. However, due to incorrect logic, it fails to properly adjust dates when holidays are involved, leading to unexpected results.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays()` in `test_date_range.py` uses a `CustomBusinessHour` frequency with holidays and expects specific dates in the result. The test fails due to the bug in the `apply` function.
3. The error message indicates a `ValueError` raised during frequency validation, specifically due to an issue matching inferred frequency and passed frequency.
4. The issue on GitHub also highlights the problem when using `date_range` with periods and holidays, resulting in unexpected output.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect adjustment of dates within the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. When dealing with negative business hour values and holidays, the function fails to properly calculate the correct dates, leading to the discrepancy in the test results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Identify the specific logic where the date adjustment goes wrong, especially when dealing with negative business hour values and holidays.
2. Ensure that the adjustments based on business days and business hours are calculated correctly and account for holidays properly.
3. Correctly handle the edge case scenarios to ensure consistent results.
4. Update the logic within the `apply` function to address the identified issues.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            original_other = other
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )

            n = self.n
            skip_amount = 1 if n < 0 else 0

            def adjust_date():
                if n < 0 and self._is_on_offset(other):
                    return True
                return other.time() not in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other)

            while n != 0:
                if adjust_date():
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    n -= skip_amount
                else:
                    num_bhours = abs(n) % len(self.start)  # Number of business hours to adjust
                    desired_index = -1 * n  # Calculate index based on negative n
                    if n < 0:
                        desired_index = (desired_index % len(self.start)) * -1

                    other = other.replace(
                        hour=self.start[desired_index].hour,
                        minute=self.start[desired_index].minute,
                        second=0,
                        microsecond=0
                    )

                    n -= 1
                    if n == 0:
                        break

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the logic within the `apply` function to properly adjust dates based on business hours considering holidays and edge cases, the corrected version should allow the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays()` to pass successfully.
