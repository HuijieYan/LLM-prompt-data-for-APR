### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is causing incorrect behavior in the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency handling, leading to unexpected results as observed in the failing test.
2. The buggy function incorrectly handles adjustments for holidays and business days, resulting in misalignment of business hours within the frequency calculation.
3. The failing test highlights the issue where the date range with custom holidays does not match the expected output due to the faulty frequency adjustment logic.
4. The error message indicates a `ValueError` raised during the validation of the frequency when generating the date range with the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency.
5. The GitHub issue further confirms the unexpected behavior observed in generating date ranges with custom business hours and holidays, showcasing the need for a correction.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the logic in the `apply` function to handle holidays and business days correctly, ensuring that the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency is calculated accurately.
2. Implement a robust approach to adjusting dates based on business hours, ensuring proper alignment of time intervals when holidays are encountered.
3. Update the adjustment logic for business days and remaining business hours to correctly reflect the desired behavior as outlined in the failing test and GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = (
                        self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    )
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if (
                        bhour_remain >= bhour
                        or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0)
                    ):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the adjustment logic in the `apply` function, the issue with the date range generation using `CustomBusinessHour` frequency with holidays should be resolved.
