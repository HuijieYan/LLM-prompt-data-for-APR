### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The issue arises when custom business hours are used in conjunction with holidays, causing the date_range function to produce more periods than expected.

The failing test aims to create a DatetimeIndex with a specific frequency of CustomBusinessHour that includes holiday dates. However, due to the bug in the `apply` function, incorrect periods are calculated, leading to the error message during validation.

### Bug Explanation:
The root cause of the bug lies in the incorrect adjustment of the datetime object in the `apply` function, especially when dealing with business days and remaining business hours. This results in an incorrect calculation of the number of periods in the resulting DatetimeIndex.

The error message indicates a misalignment between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency when applying the CustomBusinessHour. This discrepancy is due to the flawed logic in the `apply` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `apply` function needs to correctly handle the adjustment of datetime objects when considering business days and remaining business hours. The goal is to ensure that the number of periods in the resulting DatetimeIndex aligns with the expected behavior.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            current = other
            while n != 0:
                result = self._adjust(current)
                current = result[0]
                n -= result[1]
            
            return current
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the adjustment loop has been simplified to ensure the correct calculation of periods based on the specified CustomBusinessHour frequency, including handling holidays appropriately. This modification should address the issue reported in the failing test and GitHub post.
