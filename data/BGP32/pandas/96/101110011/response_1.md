### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` inside the `BusinessHourMixin` class seems to be causing the issue when working with custom business hours and holidays in the `pandas.date_range` function.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` illustrates the problem when creating a `DatetimeIndex` with a custom business hour frequency and holidays. The test fails due to unexpected output.
3. The error message indicates a `ValueError` related to frequency validation when using a custom business hour frequency with holidays in `pd.date_range`.
4. The GitHub issue highlights a similar problem where `pd.date_range` produces more periods than expected when using a custom business hour frequency with holidays.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `apply` function may arise from not handling holidays correctly, leading to the generation of extra periods in the `pd.date_range`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Enhance the handling of holidays within the `apply` function to ensure accurate adjustment to the target datetime based on the custom business hours.
2. Update the logic to correctly calculate the number of business days and remaining business hours while considering holidays.

### Corrected Version:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import ApplyTypeError, BusinessMixin, BusinessDay, CustomBusinessHour
from datetime import timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            # Adjusting for holidays
            if isinstance(self, CustomBusinessHour) and self.holidays is not None and other.date() in self.holidays:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = self.next_bday.apply(other, other_month=n < 0)

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            # Handle remaining business hours
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other)) - other if n >= 0 else \
                        self._next_opening_time(other) - other

                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break

                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying these fixes, the corrected version of the `apply` function should handle custom business hours, holidays, and the adjustment of business days correctly, resolving the issue encountered in the failing test case and the GitHub issue.
