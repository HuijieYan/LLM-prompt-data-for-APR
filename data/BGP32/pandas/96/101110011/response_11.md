### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class seems to be incorrectly processing the input datetime when applying business hour offsets.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in `test_date_range.py` highlights the issue with custom business hours and holidays causing unexpected behavior in generating date ranges.
3. The error message indicates a mismatch in the inferred frequency from passed values, causing the validation to fail.
4. The GitHub issue reflects a similar problem where date range generation with holidays results in incorrect periods.
5. The bug seems to be related to the handling of holidays and business hours in the `apply` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect calculation and adjustment within the `apply` function when processing business hour offsets, particularly related to handling holidays.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the adjustment of the input datetime accounts for holidays accurately.
2. Verify that the calculation of business day offsets considers the presence of holidays.
3. Update the logic to adjust the datetime correctly based on the business hours and holidays to generate the expected date ranges.
4. Review the handling of positive and negative offsets to apply the adjustments properly.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:

```python
    from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessMixin, BusinessDay
    from pandas.core.arrays.datetimes import DatetimeArray
    
    class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    
        @classmethod
        def apply(cls, other):
            if isinstance(other, datetime):
                n = cls.n
    
                if isinstance(other, datetime):
                    applicable_dt = other.replace(
                        microsecond=0, tzinfo=None
                    )  # Resetting timezone and nanosecond
    
                    # Adjust the input datetime based on business hours and holidays
                    if cls.on_offset(applicable_dt):
                        if n >= 0:
                            next_open = cls._next_opening_time(applicable_dt)
                            if not cls._is_on_offset(next_open):
                                next_open = cls._next_opening_time(next_open)
                        else:
                            if applicable_dt.time() in cls.start:
                                applicable_dt = applicable_dt - timedelta(seconds=1)
                            next_open = cls._next_opening_time(applicable_dt)
                            if not cls._is_on_offset(next_open):
                                next_open = cls._next_opening_time(next_open)
                                next_open = cls._get_closing_time(next_open)
    
                        applicable_dt = cls._adjust_for_business_days(applicable_dt, n)
    
                        if n < 0:
                            while n < 0:
                                applicable_dt = cls._adjust_negative_offset(
                                    applicable_dt, n, cls, nanosecond
                                )
                                n += 1
                        else:
                            while n > 0:
                                applicable_dt = cls._adjust_positive_offset(
                                    applicable_dt, n, cls, nanosecond
                                )
                                n -= 1
    
                    return applicable_dt
                else:
                    raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By updating the `apply` function to adjust the input datetime correctly based on business hours, holidays, and offsets, the corrected version should resolve the issue observed in the failing test and the reported GitHub issue.
