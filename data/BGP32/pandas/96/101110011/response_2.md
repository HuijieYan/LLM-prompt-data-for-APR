### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is intended to adjust the datetime based on business hours. However, it seems to be causing unexpected behavior when holidays are included.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays()` uses a custom frequency `CustomBusinessHour` with a holiday specified and expects a specific result. The test fails due to the buggy behavior of the `apply` function.
3. The error message indicates a ValueError related to the inferred frequency not conforming to the specified frequency according to the test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays()`.
4. The GitHub issue highlights a similar problem where `pd.date_range` behaves unexpectedly when using periods along with holidays.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to the incorrect adjustment of holidays within the `apply` function. When handling negative offsets (going back in time), the logic for adjusting the specified holidays and business hours causes the unexpected behavior observed in the failing test case.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we should revise the logic within the `apply` function related to holiday handling, especially when adjusting for negative offsets and holidays. The adjustment process for holidays needs to be improved to align with the expected behavior of the custom business hours.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The revised logic ensures proper adjustment of holidays for both positive and negative offsets while aligning with the business hours specified.

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    next_open = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    bhour = next_open - other
                else:
                    bhour = other - self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))

                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    if n >= 0:
                        other = next_open
                    else:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying this corrected version of the `apply` function, the issue with adjusting custom business hours along with holidays should be resolved, and the failing test should pass without encountering the ValueError.
