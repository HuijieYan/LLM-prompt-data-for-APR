### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` is causing an issue related to the application of custom business hours, particularly when incorporating holidays in the date range.
2. The failing test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py` illustrates that when creating a date range with custom business hours and holidays, the result is incorrect, producing more periods than expected.
3. The error message from the failing test indicates a `ValueError` related to frequency validation not conforming to the passed frequency in the date range creation.
4. The GitHub issue highlights a specific scenario where the date range behaves unexpectedly when using periods and adding holidays.
5. The bug seems to be present in the logic of the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class, especially in the handling of business hours and adjustments based on the presence of holidays.

### Bug Cause:
1. The incorrect adjustment of dates in the `apply` function based on business hours, holidays, and periods is leading to the unexpected behavior in creating the date range.
2. Improper handling of the logic in adjusting the dates when holidays are present is causing the generated periods to exceed expectations.
3. The bug results from a discrepancy between the frequency inferred from the passed values and the specified frequency, leading to an incorrect generation of datetime indexes.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure proper adjustment of dates based on business days, business hours, and holidays to align with the intended frequency for generating date ranges.
2. Correct the logic for handling business hours, especially when adjusting dates forward or backward, considering holidays and business hour boundaries.
3. Validate the frequency adjustment process along with checks for holidays to ensure the correct number of periods is generated in the date range creation.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                original_other = other
                while n > 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        n -= 1
                if other.time() in self.end:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(original_other)

            else:
                while n < 0:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                    if other.time() in self.start:
                        other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                        other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With the corrected version, adjustments are based on the provided business hours, considering holidays and maintaining the correct number of periods in the date range generation process.
