### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class has issues when handling business hours in relation to custom holidays.
2. The error message from the failing test indicates a frequency mismatch issue in the `DatetimeIndex` construction.
3. The GitHub issue highlights a similar problem where the `date_range` function produces unexpected results when using periods and adding holidays.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `apply` function arises from not handling custom holidays correctly, leading to an incorrect number of periods generated in the `DatetimeIndex`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `apply` function adjusts the time period correctly considering custom holidays. We should also pay attention to how these adjustments impact the number of periods in the resulting `DatetimeIndex`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... other functions in the class

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = (
                        self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    )
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        curr_time = other + bhour
                        if curr_time.time() in self.end:
                            curr_time = self._get_closing_time(curr_time)
                        other = curr_time
             
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After using this corrected version of the `apply` function, it should handle adjustments for custom holidays appropriately, generating the expected number of periods in the `DatetimeIndex`.
