### Potential Error Locations:
1. The conversion of the input `other` to a `datetime` object might lose some precision in terms of time zones and nanosecond details.
2. Handling of negative offsets could lead to discrepancies in the calculation of business hours.

### Bug Cause Analysis:
The bug arises from the `apply` function's handling of business hours when adjusting the input `other` datetime. When business hours span multiple days and involve holidays, the adjustments made by the function are inaccurate, leading to incorrect results in the date range generation. This discrepancy causes the failing test due to the incorrect frequencies detected by Pandas.

### Bug Fixing Strategy:
1. Ensure that the conversion of `other` maintains complete precision including time zones and nanosecond details.
2. Correctly handle negative offsets to accurately calculate business hours regardless of the direction.

After applying the corrections, rerun the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` to verify that the bug has been successfully fixed.
