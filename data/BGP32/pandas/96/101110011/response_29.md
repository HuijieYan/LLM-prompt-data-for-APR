### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` under the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The issue is related to the correct alignment of business hours when dealing with custom holidays.
3. The failing test involves creating a date range using custom business hours with holidays and checking if the result matches the expected output. The error message indicates a problem related to frequency validation.
4. The bug seems to be related to how holidays are handled within the `apply` function when adjusting dates based on business hours. The issue might be caused by incorrect calculation or handling of business hours around holidays.
5. To fix this bug, we need to review the logic within the `apply` function that adjusts dates based on business hours. Proper handling of holidays and adjustments during different scenarios (positive/negative hours) is essential.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic in the `apply` function to correctly handle holidays and adjust dates based on business hours.
2. Review the calculations and adjustments for positive and negative hours to ensure proper alignment with the specified business hours.
3. Address the issue related to frequency validation by ensuring that the date calculations are aligned with the expected business hours considering holidays.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` function:
```python
# Updated apply function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)

        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        while bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd
            bd = 0

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other if n >= 0 else self._next_opening_time(other) - other
            if n >= 0 and bhour_remain >= bhour:
                other += bhour
                bhour_remain -= bhour
            elif n < 0 and bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other) if n >= 0 else self._get_closing_time(other)
                bhour_remain -= bhour

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By implementing the corrected version of the `apply` function, the code should now handle business hours, holidays, and adjustments correctly, ensuring that the date range creation with custom business hours functions as expected.
