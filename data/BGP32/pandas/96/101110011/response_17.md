### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class inside the `offsets.py` file of `pandas`.
2. The issue arises when using `pd.date_range` with a `CustomBusinessHour` frequency containing holidays. It results in an incorrect number of periods due to improper adjustments in the `apply` function.
3. The failing test provides an example where the expected output does not match the actual output due to the bug in `apply`.
4. The bug involves incorrect handling of holidays within the `apply` function that leads to an incorrect number of periods when generating date ranges.
5. To fix this bug, adjustments need to be made in the `apply` function to correctly account for holidays and their impact on the date ranges.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the logic for handling holidays in the `apply` function.
2. Make sure to properly adjust the date ranges when encountering holidays to ensure the correct number of periods is generated.
3. Validate the correct behavior with date ranges containing holidays to match the expected output.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` function:
```python
# Fixed version of the buggy function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            # midday business hour may not be on BusinessDay
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain.total_seconds():
            if n >= 0:
                next_hour = self._next_opening_time(other)
                bhour = min(bhour_remain, next_hour - other)
                other += bhour
            else:
                prev_hour = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                bhour = min(bhour_remain, other - prev_hour)
                other -= bhour

            if bhour == bhour_remain:  # Avoid infinitive loop
                break

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

By making the suggested corrections and adjustments to how holidays are handled within the `apply` function, this revised version should be able to pass the failing test case and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
