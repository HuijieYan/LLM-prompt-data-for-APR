### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class within the `offsets.py` module of Pandas is responsible for adjusting datetime values based on business hours and offsets.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` checks the behavior of generating date ranges with custom business hours and holidays, highlighting issues with the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency.
3. The error message indicates a problem with the inferred frequency not matching the expected frequency, leading to a `ValueError`.
4. The GitHub issue further elaborates on the problem when using periods with `date_range` and adding holidays.
  
### Bug Identification:
1. The implementation of adjusting datetime values in the `apply` function might not handle holidays correctly.
2. Incorrect adjustments based on business days may lead to exceeding the expected periods, causing issues with the date range generation.
3. The frequency validation in the failing test indicates a discrepancy in frequency comparison.

### Bug Cause:
1. The bug stems from the incorrect adjustment of datetime values based on holidays and business hours within the `apply` function.
2. When holidays are added, the adjustments may lead to unexpected shifts in the generated date range, causing discrepancies in the frequency validation.
3. This inconsistency results in the failing test and the corresponding error message due to the frequency mismatch.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure proper handling of holidays in the adjustment logic within the `apply` function.
2. Verify and correct the logic related to adjusting business days to prevent exceeding the expected periods.
3. Improve the frequency validation to address the mismatch issue observed in the failing test.

### Corrected Version:
```python

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # Existing functions go here
    
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):

                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open

                    other += min(bhour_remain, bhour)
                    bhour_remain -= min(bhour_remain, bhour)
                    
                    if bhour_remain != timedelta(0):

                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))
                    else:

                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

                        if nanosecond != 0:
                            other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the adjustments in the `apply` function to handle holidays and business days more efficiently, the fixed version aims to address the frequency mismatch issue observed in the failing test.
