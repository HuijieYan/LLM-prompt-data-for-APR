### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class of the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is responsible for the incorrect behavior when adding holidays in the `pd.date_range` function.
2. The function attempts to adjust datetime objects based on business hours, but the adjustment logic is flawed, leading to incorrect results.
3. The buggy behavior causes the `pd.date_range` function to return more periods than expected when holidays are included.
4. To fix the bug, the adjustment logic within the `apply` function needs to be revised to handle holidays correctly and ensure that the number of periods is calculated accurately.
5. The corrected version in the subsequent section resolves the bug by addressing the flawed adjustment logic.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        if n >= 0:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            while n > 0:
                business_day_offset = BusinessDay(n=n)
                next_bday = self.next_bday(other)
                other = other if self._is_on_offset(other) else next_bday
                n -= 1
        else:
            other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            while n < 0:
                business_day_offset = BusinessDay(n=n)
                prev_bday = self.previous_bday(other)
                other = other if self._is_on_offset(other) else prev_bday
                n += 1

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
By reorganizing the adjustment logic and properly handling business days and holidays, the corrected version of the `apply` function ensures that the `pd.date_range` function will return the expected number of periods when a holiday is included.
