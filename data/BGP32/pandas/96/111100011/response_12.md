## Analysis
The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is responsible for calculating the next business hour based on the given input. The issue mentioned on GitHub relates to using custom business hours with holidays in the `pd.date_range` function, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Error Locations
1. In the buggy function, the logic to adjust the business days and business hours may not account for the presence of holidays correctly.
2. The adjustment of the input datetime `other` to match the time may cause discrepancies.
3. Calculation of business hours and adjustment based on the given business hours may lead to incorrect results.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug lies in the way the `apply` function handles adjustments for business days, hours, and holidays. When incorporating holidays, the logic inside the function fails to correctly adjust the datetime for holidays, leading to discrepancies in the output when using `pd.date_range`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To address this bug, it is essential to improve the handling of holidays within the `apply` function. Proper adjustment for holidays, along with accurate calculation of business days and hours, should be implemented to ensure the function works correctly.

## Corrected Version
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        
        start_time = pd.Timestamp(other).floor('D') + pd.Timedelta(hours=self.start[0].hour, minutes=self.start[0].minute)
        
        delta = pd.Timedelta(n, unit='B')
        business_time = pd.Offsets.BusinessHour(start=self.start[0], end=self.end[0])

        result = start_time + delta

        while business_time.is_on_offset(result) or pd.Timestamp(result).weekday() in self.holidays:
            result = result + delta
        
        return result
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version:
- Adjust the input time `other` directly to the start time of the business hour for proper calculations.
- Use a loop to increment the datetime by the given number of business hours (`n`) while considering weekends and holidays.
- Ensure that the resulting datetime is correct according to business hours, holidays, and weekends. 

This corrected version should address the issue mentioned in the GitHub report and provide the expected output for `pd.date_range` with custom business hours and holidays.
