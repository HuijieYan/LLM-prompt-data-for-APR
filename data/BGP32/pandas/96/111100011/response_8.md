### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which is a subclass of `BusinessMixin`. The `apply` function tries to adjust a given datetime using business hour offsets. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` highlights an issue with the behavior of the function when holidays are included in the offset calculation. The issue mentioned in the GitHub problem statement is related to this bug, where the output is incorrect when holidays are provided along with the custom business hour offset.

### Potential Error Locations:
- Handling of holidays in the offset calculation may be incorrect.
- Adjusting the datetime based on business days and remaining business hours could be problematic.
- Calculating the total business hours by seconds could have errors.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by incorrect adjustments made when considering holidays in the `apply` function. The function does not properly handle the case where holidays affect the number of business hours or the adjustment of the datetime.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that holidays are correctly incorporated into the business hour calculations.
2. Review the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business days and remaining business hours.
3. Verify the computation of total business hours to account for any potential miscalculations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Reset timezone and nanosecond for consistency
            other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, nanosecond=0)
            n = self.n

            # Adjust the input datetime based on the business hour offset's properties
            adjusted_dt = self.adjust_datetime(other, n)

            return adjusted_dt
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

    def adjust_datetime(self, dt, n):
        # Adjust the input datetime based on business hour offset and holidays
        businessdays = self.business_days_in_offset(n)
        remaining_hours = (n % self.business_hours_in_offset()) * 60

        adjusted_dt = dt
        for business_day in range(businessdays):
            adjusted_dt = self.forward_one_business_day(adjusted_dt)
        adjusted_dt += timedelta(minutes=remaining_hours)

        return adjusted_dt

    def business_days_in_offset(self, n):
        total_business_hours = self.business_hours_in_offset() // 60
        return abs(n) // total_business_hours

    def business_hours_in_offset(self):
        return sum(end - start for start, end in zip(self.start, self.end))

    def forward_one_business_day(self, dt):
        # Move the datetime to the next business day
        next_day = dt + timedelta(days=1)
        while not self.is_on_offset(next_day) or self.is_holiday(next_day):
            next_day += timedelta(days=1)
        return next_day

    def is_holiday(self, dt):
        return dt.date() in self.holidays
```

This corrected version ensures proper adjustment of the input datetime considering holidays, business days, and remaining business hours in the business hour offset. Make sure to include the relevant logic for holiday handling and datetime adjustments as presented in the `adjust_datetime` function.
