## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `offsets.py` file is supposed to adjust datetime objects based on business hours. However, due to a bug, it is not handling business days correctly, leading to incorrect results when combined with holidays in `pd.date_range`.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in `test_date_range.py` demonstrates the issue where adding holidays causes more periods to be generated than expected.
3. The GitHub issue indicates that when using periods and adding a holiday, `pd.date_range` produces more periods than intended, which aligns with the behavior observed in the failing test.
4. To fix this bug, we need to properly adjust datetime objects for business days and business hours based on the provided input, ensuring that the correct number of periods is generated despite the presence of holidays.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Address the adjustment of business days in the `apply` function to properly handle the shift in datetime objects while considering holidays.
2. Modify the logic for adjusting business hours to ensure that the correct number of periods is generated when holidays are provided.
3. Update the function to accurately determine the total business hours in a day and adjust the datetime objects accordingly.
4. Ensure that the `apply` function correctly combines business hours with datetime objects while accounting for holidays.

## Corrected Version of the `apply` function:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

            if n < 0:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if other.time() in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            if n >= 0:
                bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            else:
                bd, r = -(abs(n) + 1) // (businesshours // 60), -(abs(n) * 60 % businesshours)

            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other

                if n >= 0:
                    if bhour_remain < bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the `apply` function as outlined above, the issue mentioned in the GitHub report should be resolved, and the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is expected to pass successfully.
