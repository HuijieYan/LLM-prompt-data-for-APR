The bug in the provided code stems from the incorrect handling of holidays when calculating the date range with custom business hours. This leads to an unexpected increase in the number of periods when holidays are included, as observed in the failing test and the GitHub issue.

To address this issue, we need to modify the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class. Specifically, we need to adjust the logic related to handling holidays and the number of periods when calculating the date range. By properly considering holidays and adjusting the business hours according to the specified frequency, we can fix the bug.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if self.start is None or self.end is None:
            raise ValueError("start and end times must not be None")
        
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        cleaned_other = datetime(
            other.year, other.month, other.day,
            other.hour, other.minute, other.second, other.microsecond
        )

        # Handle moving to the next opening time based on the specified frequency
        if n >= 0:
            if cleaned_other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(cleaned_other):
                cleaned_other = self._next_opening_time(cleaned_other)
        else:
            if cleaned_other.time() in self.start:
                # adjust to move to the previous business day
                cleaned_other = cleaned_other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(cleaned_other):
                cleaned_other = self._next_opening_time(cleaned_other)
                cleaned_other = self._get_closing_time(cleaned_other)

        if self.holidays and cleaned_other.date() in self.holidays:
            cleaned_other = self._next_opening_time(cleaned_other)

        return cleaned_other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By incorporating the adjustment for holidays within the date range calculation, the corrected version of the `apply` function should now produce the expected results and pass the failing test mentioned in the GitHub issue. This fix addresses the bug related to the incorrect handling of holidays and the number of periods when using custom business hours with the `date_range` function.
