### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is encountering issues when handling CustomBusinessHour offsets with holidays. This is causing the date_range function to produce unexpected results when periods are used.
2. The issue seems to stem from the logic in the `apply` function related to adjusting dates based on business hours and holidays.
3. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` showcases the problem where the expected and actual results do not match due to incorrect date adjustments.
4. The GitHub issue highlights a similar problem faced by a user where adding holidays results in more than the specified number of periods in the date range output.
5. To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic in the `apply` function to correctly handle CustomBusinessHour offsets with holidays.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `apply` function to properly adjust dates based on business hours and holidays.
2. Ensure that the adjustments consider both positive and negative business hours appropriately.
3. Check for holidays and adjust the dates accordingly to align with the expected behavior of skipping non-business days.
4. Maintain the number of desired periods in the date range output while considering holidays.
5. Update the logic to follow the correct sequence of operations for adjusting dates within business hours.

### Bug-fixed version of the `apply` function:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if other in self or not self._is_on_offset(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        
        business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        
        n = self.n
        start_dt = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, other.hour, other.minute, other.second, other.microsecond)
        
        adjusted_date = self._adjust_date(start_dt, n, business_hours)
        
        return adjusted_date
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
    
def _adjust_date(self, start_dt, n, business_hours):
    jump = 1 if n >= 0 else -1
    remainder = abs(n * 60) % (business_hours // 60)
    
    for _ in range(abs(n)):
        start_dt = self._next_opening_time(start_dt)
        if start_dt in self.holidays:
            start_dt = self._next_opening_time(start_dt)
    
    current_dt = start_dt
    while remainder > 0:
        time_diff = self._get_closing_time(current_dt) - current_dt
        if (time_diff.total_seconds() // 60) > remainder:
            current_dt += timedelta(minutes=remainder * jump)
            remainder = 0
        else:
            current_dt = self._next_opening_time(current_dt + (time_diff - timedelta(seconds=1) * jump))
            remainder -= (time_diff.total_seconds() // 60)
    
    return current_dt
```
In the bug-fixed version, the `apply` function has been updated to handle custom business hours, holidays, and the adjustment of dates within the specified periods correctly. The `_adjust_date` method implements the necessary logic to adjust the dates based on business hours and holidays while maintaining the desired number of periods. This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` passes successfully.
