### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class and is used for adjusting dates when applying a business hour offset.
2. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when using `pd.date_range` with custom business hours and holidays, the number of periods generated is more than expected.
3. The bug in the function likely stems from the incorrect adjustment of dates based on business hours and holidays, leading to the incorrect number of periods being calculated.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the logic for handling holidays in the `apply` function to ensure that the periods are calculated correctly when holidays are present.
2. Review the calculations related to business hours and holiday adjustments within the function to align them correctly with the expected behavior.

### Corrected Function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            # adjust for timezone and nanoseconds
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )

            if n >= 0:
                # Adjust for next opening time if needed
                while other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                # Adjust for previous opening time and next business day
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                while other.time() not in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd
            
            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        break
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        break
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

After applying the corrected version of the function, the failing test should pass successfully without generating extra periods.
