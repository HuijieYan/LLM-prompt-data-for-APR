### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class within the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is causing the issue.
2. The issue arises when using `pd.date_range` with the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency and providing holidays. The resulting output contains more periods than expected.
3. The bug is likely related to the adjustment of business days and hours in the `apply` function, leading to incorrect calculations when holidays are involved.
4. To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for adjusting business days and hours based on holidays to ensure the correct number of periods is generated.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class.

### Correction:
```python
# corrected and fixed version of the apply function
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if self._is_on_offset(other):
            direction = 1 if n >= 0 else -1
            other = self._next_opening_time(other, n)
            bhours_remain = abs(n * 60)
            bhours = 0

            while bhours_remain > 0:
                bhour = self._get_business_hours_by_sec(other.time(), other.time())[0]
                bhours += bhour
                if bhours >= bhours_remain:
                    break
                other = self._next_opening_time(other, direction)
                bhours_remain -= bhour

            if bhours_remain > 0:
                if n < 0:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                else:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other, direction)
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Explaination:
The corrected version of the `apply` function simplifies the logic inside the function to correctly adjust the datetime based on the provided offset (`self.n`). It ensures that the correct number of business hours are considered while handling holidays and adjusting the datetime accordingly. This corrected version should resolve the issue with `pd.date_range` involving holidays and `CustomBusinessHour` frequency.
