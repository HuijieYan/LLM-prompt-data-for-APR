## Analysis
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is causing the issue identified in the GitHub post. The function is not correctly handling the adjustments for business days and business hours, resulting in incorrect dates being generated when holidays are included.

## Bug Location
The bug is likely in the business day adjustment portion of the function where it calculates and applies the business day offset. This part is not correctly adjusting for holidays, leading to the incorrect date ranges.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of holidays in the `apply` function. When a holiday falls within the date range, the function fails to skip over the holiday and adjust the dates accordingly. This leads to the observed behavior where more dates than expected are generated.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to properly handle holidays when calculating the business day offsets. Proper adjustments should be made to skip over the holidays and maintain the expected date range.

## Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            businessdays = pd.offsets.BDay(n=abs(n)).rollforward(other)
            
            while not businessdays.is_on_offset(other) or businessdays in pd.to_datetime(self.holidays):
                businessdays = self.next_bday(businessdays)
            
            return businessdays
            
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version:
1. We adjust the `businessdays` by the absolute value of `n`.
2. We then iterate through the adjusted `businessdays`, skipping over any holidays in the list.
3. Once we find a valid offset without holidays, we return that date.

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle holidays and produce the expected date ranges without the issue described in the GitHub post.
