## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class within `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` is responsible for adjusting dates and times based on business hour offsets.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the adjustment is handled when holidays are provided, leading to more periods being generated than expected.
3. The failing test case in `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays()` is meant to address this bug by setting holidays and checking if the period generation works correctly, which currently it does not due to the bug in the `apply` function.
4. The GitHub issue describes a similar scenario where providing holidays causes date generation issues, which aligns with the failing test case.
5. The bug seems to be in the logic for adjusting the dates in the `apply` function, especially when holidays are involved. The addition of holidays should be accounted for when calculating the periods to generate.
6. To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic in the `apply` function to handle holidays appropriately and ensure that the correct number of periods is generated.

## Proposed Fix:
Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if not hasattr(other, "tzinfo"):
            other = other.replace(tzinfo=None)
        n = self.n

        if n < 0:
            other -= timedelta(minutes=1)

        while True:
            archive = other

            while True:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                if n == 0 or other not in self.start:
                    break

            n -= 1
            if n == 0:
                break

            if other == archive:
                break
        
            other = self._next_opening_time(other - timedelta(minutes=1))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With this corrected version, the `apply` function should now handle holidays correctly and generate the expected number of periods when used in scenarios like the failing test case.
