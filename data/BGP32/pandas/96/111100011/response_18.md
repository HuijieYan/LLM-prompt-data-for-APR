### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is using incorrect logic for adjusting the datetime based on business hours, leading to incorrect results when combined with holidays.
2. The buggy function is trying to adjust the datetime based on business hours and days, but the logic for handling negative business day offsets is flawed.
3. The failing test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in the test file is highlighting the issue by showing that when using holidays with a negative business day offset, the periods generated are more than expected.
4. The GitHub issue describes a similar problem where `pd.date_range` does not behave as expected when using holidays with periods.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect adjustment of datetime within the `apply` function when dealing with negative business day offsets and holidays. The logic for adjusting the datetime based on business hours and days is not handling the situation correctly, resulting in additional periods being generated.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `apply` function to correctly handle negative business day offsets in conjunction with holidays. Specifically, we need to adjust the datetime calculation logic to properly account for holidays and offsets.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                while not self._is_on_offset(other) or other.time() in self.start:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other) + timedelta(seconds=1)
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if (
                        bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0)
                    ):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other - timedelta(seconds=1)))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function should address the bug and ensure that the adjustments of datetime based on business hours, days, and holidays are done correctly.
