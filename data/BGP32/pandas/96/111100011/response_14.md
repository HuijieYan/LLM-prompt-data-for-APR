### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is a method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The reported GitHub issue describes a problem with `pd.date_range` not working as expected when using periods and adding holidays with a custom business hour frequency.
3. The issue occurs due to the incorrect adjustment of business days and hours within the `apply` function, leading to the unexpected behavior of `pd.date_range`.
4. The strategy to fix the bug involves ensuring the correct adjustment of business days and hours based on the provided frequency and holidays.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Remove the unnecessary nanosecond retrieval
            # Replace datetime with as_datetime for timezone handling
            other = as_datetime(other)
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday().is_on_offset(other):  # Correct method call
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making adjustments to ensure correct business day offsets and business hour adjustments, the corrected `apply` method should now address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
