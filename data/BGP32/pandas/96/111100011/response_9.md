### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `offsets.py` file of the `pandas` library.
2. The function handles datetime objects to adjust for custom business hours and holidays.
3. The test function is testing the creation of dates with custom business hours and holidays, which is failing due to incorrect adjustment of periods.
4. The GitHub issue describes a similar problem with `date_range` not working as expected when using periods and holidays, leading to extra periods being generated.

### Bug:
The bug seems to be in the logic of adjusting the datetime object when calculating periods within the `apply` function. It incorrectly handles the case when adjusting for negative periods, leading to extra periods being generated when holidays are involved.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustment of datetime objects for negative periods and holidays is handled correctly within the `apply` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Import statements not shown for brevity

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # Other functions remain the same as mentioned in the original code

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other) + skip_bd
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    if n < 0 and bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                        other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version aims to adjust the datetime object correctly for both positive and negative periods when considering holidays, ensuring that the `date_range` function will work as expected with custom business hours and holidays.
