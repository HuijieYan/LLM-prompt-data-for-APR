### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is responsible for adjusting datetime based on business hours in the context of custom business hours with holidays. The buggy function contains logic to handle adding business hours to a datetime while considering holidays and working hours.

The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is checking if adding custom business hours with holidays using `pd.date_range` works correctly, specifically with the `CustomBusinessHour` offset. The test fails due to an issue where adding holidays in the `CustomBusinessHour` offset results in more periods than expected.

### Bug:
The bug lies in the `apply` function where the logic for adjusting the datetime is incorrect when handling negative offsets involving holidays. This leads to the incorrect computation of business hours and offsets, resulting in more periods than expected in the output of `pd.date_range`.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic for adjusting datetime objects based on business hours and holidays to ensure correct handling, especially with negative offsets.
2. Update the date adjustment logic considering holidays and business hours to align the adjustment correctly with the expected behavior of the `CustomBusinessHour` offset.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            if n >= 0:
                if not self._is_on_offset(other) or other.time() == self.end[0]:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() == self.start[0]:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            delta_minutes = abs(n * 60)
            delta_days = delta_minutes // (businesshours // 60)
            delta_minutes %= businesshours // 60

            if n < 0:
                delta_days, delta_minutes = -delta_days, -delta_minutes

            if delta_days != 0:
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + BusinessDay(n=delta_days) + remain
                else:
                    other += BusinessDay(n=delta_days)

            while delta_minutes != 0:
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if delta_minutes < bhour.total_seconds() / 60:
                        other += timedelta(minutes=delta_minutes)
                        break
                    delta_minutes -= bhour.total_seconds() / 60
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if delta_minutes > bhour.total_seconds() / 60 or (delta_minutes == bhour.total_seconds() / 60 and other.nanosecond != 0):
                        other += timedelta(minutes=delta_minutes)
                        break
                    delta_minutes = 0
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected version of the `apply` function addresses the original bug by adjusting datetime objects based on the business hours and holidays accurately, ensuring that the custom business hours work correctly with holidays in `pd.date_range` scenarios.
