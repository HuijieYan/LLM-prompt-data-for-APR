### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class which includes multiple related functions such as `next_bday`, `_next_opening_time`, `_get_business_hours_by_sec`, `_get_closing_time`, `is_on_offset`, `_is_on_offset`, etc.
2. The buggy function is using an incorrect approach to adjust the datetime based on business hours causing the issue when holidays are involved in the calculation.
3. The bug is causing the `pd.date_range` function to behave unexpectedly and generate more periods than expected when holidays are included in the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency.
4. To fix the bug, the adjustment logic within the `apply` function needs to be corrected to handle holidays properly.
   
### Correction:
```python
# Corrected version of the apply function
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        # Reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(microsecond=0)

        businessdays = pd.offsets.CustomBusinessDay()

        # Calculate business days and remaining hours
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n), len(self.start))
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        # Adjust by business days first
        other += businessdays * bd
        
        # Skip holidays
        while self._get_closing_time(other) in self.start:
            other += pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour() * 1
        
        if r < 0:
            # Adjust backwards
            while r < 0:
                other -= pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour() * 1
                r += 1
        elif r > 0:
            # Adjust forwards
            while r > 0:
                other += pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour() * 1
                r -= 1

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying this correction, the `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` function should pass successfully without generating extra periods due to holidays.
