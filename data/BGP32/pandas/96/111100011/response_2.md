### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class within the `pandas` library.
2. The function takes in a datetime object `other` and performs various calculations to adjust the datetime based on business hours.
3. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when using `date_range` with `periods` and adding holidays, the output is incorrect as it produces more than the specified number of periods.
4. The problem seems to be related to the `apply` function within the `CustomBusinessHour` offset class.

### Identified Issue:
The issue in the `apply` function is related to how holidays are handled when adjusting the datetime based on business hours. The incorrect adjustment logic results in an excess number of periods being generated when holidays are involved.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic within the `apply` function that handles adding holidays to ensure that the correct number of periods is generated without any duplicates or missing entries.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    # this is the corrected version of the apply function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # use a set to keep track of unique dates
            unique_dates = set()
            
            while len(unique_dates) < abs(self.n):
                nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
                
                # handle holidays to prevent duplicates
                if hasattr(self, 'holidays') and date(other) in self.holidays:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    continue
                
                # apply the business hour offset logic
                n = self.n
                businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
                
                bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
                if n < 0:
                    bd, r = -bd, -r
                
                # adjust by business days first
                if bd != 0:
                    skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                    if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                        prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                        remain = other - prev_open
                        other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                    else:
                        other = other + skip_bd
                
                bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
                
                # adjust remaining business hours
                if n >= 0:
                    while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                        bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                        if bhour_remain < bhour:
                            other += bhour_remain
                            bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                        else:
                            bhour_remain -= bhour
                            other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                        bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                        if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                            other += bhour_remain
                            bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                        else:
                            bhour_remain -= bhour
                            other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
                
                # add the adjusted date to the set of unique dates
                unique_dates.add(other)
        
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the logic within the `apply` function to handle holidays properly and ensure that each generated date is unique, we can fix the bug reported in the GitHub issue. This corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
