## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is responsible for adjusting the given datetime based on business hours, but it has an issue causing unexpected behavior when handling holidays with periods.
2. The failing test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py` demonstrates the problem by showing incorrect results when using periods and adding holidays.
3. The GitHub issue describes the specific problem where using `pd.date_range` with periods and holidays results in more periods than expected, highlighting the behavior that the bug is causing.
4. The bug seems to stem from how the function adjusts the given datetime when dealing with negative business hours and holidays. It fails to handle the holiday correctly within the logic, leading to the unexpected output in the test.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that holidays are properly considered when adjusting the datetime to avoid the issue shown in the failing test.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the logic within the `apply` function to correctly handle holidays when adjusting the datetime based on business hours.
2. Update the adjustment process to account for both positive and negative business hours in relation to holidays.
3. Ensure that the holiday dates are properly taken into consideration when calculating the adjusted datetime.

## Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function that addresses the bug related to holidays and periods:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(n * 60, businesshours // 60)
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = other.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                bhour = (
                    self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                )
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    other += bhour
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the logic related to holidays and business hours adjustment within the `apply` function, the issue described in the GitHub report should be resolved, and the failing test should pass successfully.
