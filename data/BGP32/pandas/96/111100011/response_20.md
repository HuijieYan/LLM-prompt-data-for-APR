### Analysis:
The buggy function is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas.tseries.offsets` module. The issue reported on GitHub states that when using `pd.date_range` with `periods` and adding holidays, it produces unexpected results.

### Error Location:
The issue in the buggy function revolves around the calculation of business hours, adjustment of dates for business days, and handling of remaining business hours. This leads to incorrect results when adding holidays while using `pd.date_range`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The root cause of the bug lies in how the `apply` function handles adjustments based on business hours, business days, and holidays. The incorrect calculation logic results in the generation of more periods than expected in the `pd.date_range` when a holiday is included.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for adjusting the given datetime considering business hours, business days, and holidays in a way that aligns with the expected behavior of `pd.date_range`.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `apply` function that addresses the issue and aligns the behavior with the expected results in `pd.date_range`.

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            business_day = BusinessDay()
    
            if n >= 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            while n > 0:
                business_day = business_day.next()
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other += business_day
                n -= 1
    
            while n < 0:
                business_day = business_day.prev()
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other += business_day
                n += 1
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With the corrected version of the `apply` function, the reported issue related to `pd.date_range` with holidays should be resolved, and the function should work as expected.
