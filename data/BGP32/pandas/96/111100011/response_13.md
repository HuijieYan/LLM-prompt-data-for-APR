### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas.tseries.offsets.py` file is causing incorrect behavior when used in conjunction with custom business hours and holidays in `pd.date_range`.

### Identified issue:
The problem seems to stem from the logic within the `apply` function that adjusts the datetime based on business hours and holidays. It fails to handle the case where holidays are involved, leading to an incorrect number of periods in the resulting `DatetimeIndex`.

### Bug Cause:
1. The `apply` function does not account for holidays correctly when adjusting the datetime based on business hours, leading to miscalculations in the resulting `DatetimeIndex`.
2. The logic for handling holidays is missing or incorrect, causing the unexpected behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the `apply` function to properly consider holidays when adjusting the datetime based on business hours.
2. Incorporate logic to skip holidays when calculating business days and remaining business hours.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` function:

```python
# Import required modules
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            # Check for holidays and adjust datetime accordingly
            while other in self.holidays:
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1)

            # Logic for adjusting datetime based on business hours
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)

            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                if n < 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            # Adjust remaining business hours
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    if n >= 0:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                    else:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

```

This corrected version of the `apply` function should handle holidays correctly and adjust the datetime based on business hours to ensure the `pd.date_range` functions as expected with custom business hours and holidays.
