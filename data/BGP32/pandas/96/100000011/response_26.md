### Analysis:
The buggy function is `apply` in the `CustomBusinessHour` class in the `pandas` library. This function is used to adjust a given datetime value based on the business hour offsets defined in the class instance.

The GitHub issue points to an unexpected behavior when using the `date_range` function with the `periods` parameter along with holidays. It results in more periods being generated than expected, which is likely due to the buggy behavior of the `apply` function in handling offsets and holidays correctly.

### Potential error locations:
1. Incorrect adjustment of datetime values in `apply` function.
2. Incorrect handling of holiday dates within the business hour adjustment logic.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs due to incorrect adjustments and handling of holidays in the `apply` function within the `CustomBusinessHour` class. This incorrect behavior causes the `date_range` function to generate more periods than expected when holidays are specified.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that holiday dates are correctly considered in the adjustment logic.
2. Properly adjust the datetime values based on the business hour offsets, considering holidays to avoid excessive period generation by the `date_range` function.

### Corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        while not self.is_on_offset(other):
            other += timedelta(seconds=3600)
        
        original_other = other
        iterations = 0
        while iterations <= abs(self.n) - 1:
            other += self.n * timedelta(hours=1)
            if self.is_on_offset(other):
                iterations += 1
            while other.weekday() in self.weekmask or other.date() in self.holidays:
                other += timedelta(days=1)
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version addresses the issue with adjusting datetime values based on the business hour offsets while considering holidays properly. This should resolve the problem described in the GitHub issue related to the unexpected behavior of the `date_range` function with holidays and periods.
