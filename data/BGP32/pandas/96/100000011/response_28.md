### Analysis:
The provided buggy function `apply` is related to the GitHub issue titled "Pandas date_range does not work when using periods and adding holiday". The issue describes unexpected behavior when using the `pd.date_range` function with periods and holidays provided in the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The adjustment logic based on business days and business hours may not be correctly handling the edge cases involving holidays.
2. The calculation of `businesshours` may not be considering the holidays.
3. Time intervals may not be adjusted correctly when holidays are taken into account.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy code does not correctly handle holidays when adjusting the frequency based on business days and hours. This results in the unexpected behavior described in the GitHub issue.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the adjustment logic to skip holidays and handle them appropriately.
2. Consider holidays when calculating the total business hours.
3. Ensure that the time intervals are adjusted correctly with respect to holidays.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour, BusinessDay

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if not hasattr(self, 'holidays'):
            self.holidays = set()
        
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        
        n = self.n
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            if en not in self.holidays
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            while not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                other += skip_bd
        
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        
        if n >= 0:
            for _ in range(10000):  # Prevent infinite loop
                if bhour_remain == timedelta(0):
                    break
                
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            for _ in range(10000):  # Prevent infinite loop
                if bhour_remain == timedelta(0):
                    break
                
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
                
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This updated version of the `apply` function addresses the issues related to holidays and recalculates the adjustment logic based on business days and hours. By correctly handling holidays, the function should now resolve the problem described in the GitHub issue.
