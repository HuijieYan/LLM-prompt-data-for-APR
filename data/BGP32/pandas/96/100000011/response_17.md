### Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the GitHub issue:
- The buggy function `apply` is related to custom business hour offsets in Pandas, which is similar to the issue reported on GitHub about `pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour`.
- The GitHub issue involves generating date ranges with custom business hour offsets and holidays causing unexpected results where adding holidays increases the number of periods beyond the specified value.

### Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function:
- The bug might be related to how the function handles adjustments and calculations based on the number of business days and remaining business hours.

### Explaining the cause of the bug:
- The bug seems to be in the logic that calculates the adjustments for business days and remaining business hours, potentially causing the incorrect generation of periods when holidays are involved.

### Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug:
- One possible strategy to fix the bug is to ensure proper handling of holidays in the logic related to business day calculations and adjustments.
- Additionally, verifying the adjustment calculations for business days and remaining hours is crucial to fix the unexpected behavior.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if not self.on_offset(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        
        n = self.n
        target_date = other

        business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        
        total_minutes = abs(n * 60)
        business_days, remaining_minutes = divmod(total_minutes, business_hours // 60)
        
        if n < 0:
            business_days, remaining_minutes = -business_days, -remaining_minutes
        
        business_hour_remain = timedelta(minutes=remaining_minutes)
        
        for _ in range(abs(business_days)):
            target_date = (target_date + BusinessDay(1) if n > 0 else target_date - BusinessDay(1)).replace(
                hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0
            )
            while business_hour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                business_hour = self._get_closing_time(target_date) - target_date
                if business_hour_remain < business_hour:
                    target_date += business_hour_remain
                    business_hour_remain = timedelta()
                else:
                    business_hour_remain -= business_hour
                    target_date = self._next_opening_time(target_date + business_hour)
        
        if n < 0:
            target_date += self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(target_date + business_hour)) - target_date
        
        return target_date
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Summary:
- In the corrected function, adjustments for business days and remaining business hours have been revised to ensure proper handling of the custom business hour offsets and holidays.
- This correction should address the issue reported on GitHub where adding holidays resulted in unexpected behaviors in generating date ranges with custom business hour offsets.
