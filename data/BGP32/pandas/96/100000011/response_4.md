### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is a method of the `CustomBusinessHour` class in the pandas library. The GitHub issue mentions a problem related to `CustomBusinessHour` with holidays causing `pd.date_range` to produce unexpected results, specifically affecting the number of periods generated.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of holidays within the `apply` function.
2. Calculation of business hours in each business day.
3. Adjustment of business days and remaining business hours.

### Cause of the Bug:
The issue arises due to the incorrect handling of holidays within the `apply` function of the `CustomBusinessHour` class. When a holiday is added, the calculation of periods in `pd.date_range` is affected, resulting in unexpected outputs.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Identify the holiday dates and exclude them from the date calculation process.
2. Ensure the correct calculation of business hours and adjustments considering holidays.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if self.holidays and other.date() in self.holidays:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Holiday date provided")

        n = self.n

        # Adjust other to reduce the number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._prev_business_hour_end(other)

        business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._prev_business_hour_end(other) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    other = self._prev_business_hour_end(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Bug Fix Details:
1. Check for holidays in the given datetime and raise an error if a holiday date is encountered.
2. Adjust the business hour calculations and adjustments to correctly handle the addition or subtraction of business days and remaining hours. 

By implementing these changes, the corrected `apply` function should address the issue reported in the GitHub thread related to `CustomBusinessHour` with holidays causing unexpected results in `pd.date_range`.
