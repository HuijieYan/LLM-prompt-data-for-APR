### Analysis:
The GitHub issue mentions a problem with the `pd.date_range` function when using periods and adding holidays, resulting in unexpected behavior. The issue seems to coincide with the `apply` function in the `offsets.py` file. The bug affects the creation of a `DatetimeIndex` with a `CustomBusinessHour` frequency that includes holidays, causing incorrect periods.

### Identified Errors:
1. Incorrect adjustment of business days based on the holiday list.
2. Improper handling of business hour adjustments when holidays are present.
3. Flawed logic for adjusting the business time intervals.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is primarily caused by the incorrect adjustment for business days and business hours, especially in cases involving holidays. The function fails to properly handle holidays when determining the number of business days to skip and adjusting the remaining business hours.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly adjusts for both business days and business hours while accounting for holidays. Proper handling of holidays should avoid unexpected behavior in the `pd.date_range` function when using periods with `CustomBusinessHour`.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if self.holidays and any(holiday.date() == other.date() for holiday in self.holidays):
            raise ApplyTypeError("Holiday date detected: {}".format(other.date()))

        n = self.n

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            other_date = other.replace(hour=self.start[0].hour, minute=self.start[0].minute)
            while bd != 0:
                if bd > 0:
                    other_date += timedelta(days=1)
                else:
                    other_date -= timedelta(days=1)

                if other_date.weekday() < 5 and not any(other_date.date() == holiday.date() for holiday in self.holidays):
                    bd -= 1

            other = other_date.replace(hour=other.hour, minute=other.minute, second=other.second, microsecond=other.microsecond)

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                business_end = self._get_closing_time(other)
                remaining_hours = business_end - other
                if bhour_remain < remaining_hours:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(business_end)
                    bhour_remain -= remaining_hours
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                business_start = self._next_opening_time(other)
                remaining_hours = business_start - other
                if bhour_remain >= remaining_hours:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(business_start - timedelta(seconds=1))
                    bhour_remain -= remaining_hours

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By incorporating the adjustments for business days, holidays, and business hours correctly, the `apply` function should now work as intended without the earlier bug.
