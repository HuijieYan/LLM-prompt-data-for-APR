### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is responsible for adjusting a datetime object based on business hours specified by the offset. The bug described in the GitHub issue indicates that when the `pd.date_range` function is used with periods and holidays, it produces unexpected results by not properly handling the holidays.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The way the function adjusts the datetime object based on the given business hours.
2. Handling of holiday dates is not included in the adjustment logic.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `apply` function does not consider the provided holidays while adjusting the datetime object based on business hours. This omission leads to the unexpected behavior described in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to enhance the `apply` function to include the handling of holidays during the adjustment process. By checking if a given date is a holiday, we can properly adjust the datetime object while ensuring that holiday dates are skipped in the calculation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `apply` function that includes the handling of holidays:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # check if other is a holiday
        if getattr(other, "date") in self.holidays:
            return other

        # the rest of the function remains the same
        n = self.n
        ...

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, we added a check to see if the date falls under the holiday list provided in the business hour offset. If it is a holiday, we return the date as is without making any adjustments. This modification ensures that holidays are properly handled during the adjustment process, addressing the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
