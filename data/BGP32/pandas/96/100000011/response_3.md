### Analysis:
The buggy function is related to custom business hours in the `pandas` library, as seen in the GitHub issue where `pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour` is mentioned. The issue reported involves the unexpected behavior of adding holidays when using the `periods` parameter in `pd.date_range`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The handling of holidays within the custom business hour logic.
2. The adjustment of the number of periods based on holidays.
3. Incorrect adjustment of business hours when dealing with holidays.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to arise from how the custom business hour is adjusted when holidays are involved, leading to an incorrect number of periods generated in `pd.date_range`. The function needs to account for holidays in a way that aligns with the user's expectation and does not affect the generated periods.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic within the `apply` function to correctly handle holidays and maintain the desired number of periods when generating datetime values using the custom business hour logic.


### Corrected Version:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if hasattr(self, "holidays") and other in self.holidays:
            return self._next_opening_time(other)

        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)

        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, we have added a check for holidays and adjusted the logic to ensure that the custom business hour behavior aligns with user expectations, especially when used in combination with holidays.
