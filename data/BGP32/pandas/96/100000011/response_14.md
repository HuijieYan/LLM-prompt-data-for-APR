### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is responsible for applying a custom business hour offset to a given datetime. The issue reported on GitHub involves using `pd.date_range` with periods and adding holidays, which results in more periods being generated than expected. This suggests that the bug lies within the `apply` function, which is used internally by the custom business hour offset.

### Potential error locations:
1. Calculation of business hours and adjustment based on the sign of `n`.
2. Adjusting business days and remaining business hours.
3. Iteration over business time intervals to adjust the datetime.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug likely stems from the incorrect adjustment of business hours when holidays are present. The `apply` function does not handle holidays correctly, leading to the unexpected behavior seen in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the logic to skip over holidays when adjusting the datetime.
2. Ensure that the total business hours calculation accounts for holidays.
3. Make adjustments based on business days and remaining hours taking holidays into consideration.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        
        n = self.n
        total_hours = abs(n) * businesshours  # total business hours to adjust
        
        # Adjust for holidays
        holidays = getattr(self, 'holidays', [])
        holiday_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(ts, ts) for ts in holidays)
        total_hours += holiday_hours
        
        # Calculate business days and remaining hours taking into account holidays
        bd, r = divmod(total_hours, businesshours) if n >= 0 else divmod(-total_hours, businesshours)
        
        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd, holidays=holidays)  # Consider holidays when skipping business days
            other = skip_bd.apply(other)
        
        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        
        # Adjust remaining hours
        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            # Get the current business interval
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
            
            # Adjust hours
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, adjustments have been made to properly handle holidays when calculating total business hours and adjusting the datetime in the `apply` function, thus resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
