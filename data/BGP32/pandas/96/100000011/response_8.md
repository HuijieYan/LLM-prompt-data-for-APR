### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is related to the GitHub issue with `Pandas date_range` behavior when using periods and adding holidays. The issue highlights that when holidays are added to `CustomBusinessHour` frequency in `date_range`, the number of periods in the output is incorrect. This problem is likely caused by a bug in the `apply` function.

### Identified potential error locations:
1. The adjustment logic for holidays in the function may not be handling the case with holidays correctly.
2. The calculation of business hours and adjustment based on them might have a flaw affecting the output.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug in the `apply` function is likely causing incorrect adjustments in cases where holidays are involved. The function seems to be handling business hours and business day adjustments incorrectly when holidays are specified. This leads to unexpected output in the context of `date_range` with periods and holidays.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Review the logic related to holiday handling in the function and ensure it correctly adjusts the output when holidays are present.
2. Check the calculation of business hours and adjustments based on them to ensure accurate adjustments with respect to holidays.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

        if n >= 0:
            # Adjust for holidays and business hours
            while self._is_on_offset(other) and other.time() not in self.end:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            # Adjust remaining business hours based on business time intervals
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the logic within the `apply` function, especially the handling of holidays and business hour adjustments, the issue reported in the GitHub post should be resolved. The corrected function should provide the expected behavior when dealing with `CustomBusinessHour` frequency in `date_range` with periods and holidays.
