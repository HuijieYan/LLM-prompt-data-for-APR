### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is related to the issue reported on GitHub regarding `Pandas date_range` not working correctly when using periods and adding holidays. The function is responsible for adjusting the input datetime based on the custom business hours specified. The issue reported involves generating incorrect dates when using the `pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour` with holidays included.

### Identified Error Location:
The bug seems to be related to how the function handles business days and adjusts the datetime accordingly, particularly in cases where holidays are involved. The incorrect calculation within the function leads to unexpected date outputs.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the misalignment between business days, holidays, and the adjustment logic within the `apply` function. When holidays are present, the function fails to adjust the datetime correctly, resulting in more than the expected number of periods.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function `apply` correctly handles holidays when adjusting the input datetime. Proper adjustment based on both business days and holidays should be implemented to generate the correct output.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Original logic here
        
        ...

        # Correct the adjustment for holidays
        while skip_bd.bdays > 0:
            other = self.rollforward(other)
            if self._is_on_offset(other):
                bdays_to_skip = skip_bd.bdays
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=0)
                other = self.offset + skip_bd + other
            else:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=skip_bd.bdays - 1)
                other = self.offset + skip_bd + other

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that the adjustment for holidays is correctly handled by iterating through the number of business days to be skipped and adjusting the datetime accordingly with respect to holidays. This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub regarding `Pandas date_range` not working correctly with periods and holidays.
