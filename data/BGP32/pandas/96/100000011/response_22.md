### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` within `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` is responsible for adjusting a datetime object based on certain conditions related to business hours. The GitHub issue describes a problem where using the `pd.date_range` function with periods and holidays leads to unexpected behavior, producing more periods than expected.

### Potential errors:
1. The adjustment of the datetime object `other` based on business days and business hours may not be working correctly.
2. The calculations involving the total business hours and remaining business hours may have issues leading to incorrect results.

### Cause of the bug:
The buggy function `apply` is supposed to adjust the given datetime object based on business hours. However, due to potential errors in the code, it might be incorrectly adjusting the datetime object, leading to unexpected results when used in conjunction with periods and holidays in `pd.date_range`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the adjustments based on business days and hours are correctly calculated and applied.
2. Validate the code logic for adjusting the datetime object when handling positive and negative number of business days.
3. Verify that the calculations for total business hours and remaining business hours are accurate to prevent unexpected behavior.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Copy the original datetime object without timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        
        n = self.n  # Number of business hours to adjust
        
        # Total business hours in one business day
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        # Calculate business days and remaining hours
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            other = self.next_by_offsets(other, bd)

        # Remaining business hours adjustment
        if n >= 0:
            while r != 0:
                bhour = self._get_business_hours(other)  # Business hours in the current time interval
                if r < bhour:
                    other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                    r = 0
                else:
                    r -= bhour
                    other = self.next_opening_time(other + timedelta(minutes=bhour))
        else:
            while r != 0:
                bhour = self._get_business_hours(other)  # Business hours in the current time interval
                if r > bhour or r == bhour and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0:
                    other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                    r = 0
                else:
                    r -= bhour
                    other = self.get_closing_time(self.next_opening_time(other + timedelta(minutes=bhour)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the adjustments based on business days and remaining business hours have been revised to ensure the correct adjustment of the datetime object. The calculations for total business hours and handling of positive and negative business days have been modified to address the bug described in the GitHub issue.
