### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` is related to the GitHub issue "Pandas date_range does not work when using periods and adding holiday." The issue reported unexpected behavior when using `pd.date_range` with `periods` and adding holidays, resulting in more periods than intended.

### Identified Error Locations:
1. The calculation of business hours and adjusting dates based on business days and business hours.
2. The loop structure for adjusting the remaining business hours.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug originates from the incorrect handling of business days and hours within the CustomBusinessHour function. The incorrect adjustments based on the number of business days and remaining hours lead to an unexpected increase in the number of periods when holidays are involved.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper adjustment of dates considering business days, business hours, and holidays within the CustomBusinessHour function. The corrections should focus on accurately calculating and adjusting the datetime values based on the provided business hours and days.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        
        holidays = getattr(self, "holidays", [])
        is_holiday = other in holidays
        
        if is_holiday:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        
        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n > 0:
                interval_end = self._get_closing_time(other)
                bhour = interval_end - other
                if not is_holiday:
                    bhour_remain = min(bhour_remain, bhour)
                    other += bhour_remain
                other = self._next_opening_time(interval_end)
            else:
                interval_start = self._next_opening_time(other)
                bhour = interval_start - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = interval_start
                else:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version addresses the issues related to adjusting dates based on holidays, business days, and business hours within the `CustomBusinessHour` function. The adjustments are now correctly handled to avoid the unexpected increase in periods when holidays are involved.
