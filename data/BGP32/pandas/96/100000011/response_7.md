## Analysis
The buggy function `apply` in the `CustomBusinessHour` class fails to correctly adjust business hours when holidays are added, resulting in incorrect output periods from the `date_range` function. The issue reported on GitHub highlights that using `periods` with holidays leads to more than the expected number of periods being generated.

## Potential Error Locations
- Incorrect adjustment of business days and remaining business hours.
- Handling of holidays during business hour adjustments.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug arises from the inaccurate adjustment of business days and remaining business hours in the `apply` function. When holidays are added, the function fails to handle them correctly, leading to an increased number of generated periods, as observed in the GitHub issue.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that holidays are properly accounted for in the business hour adjustments. The function should accurately adjust business days and remaining hours while considering the presence of holidays to prevent the incorrect output periods experienced in the GitHub issue.

## Corrected Version of the Function
Here is a corrected version of the `apply` function within the `CustomBusinessHour` class:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        business_days = self._full_list
        non_business_days = set(self.holidays)
        
        if self.start <= other.time() < self.end or other.time() < self.start:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        
        n_days = (other - other.replace(hour=self.start.hour, minute=self.start.minute, second=0, microsecond=0)).days + int(other.time() > self.end)
        n_periods = 0
        
        while n_periods < self.n:
            other += timedelta(days=1)
            if other.weekday() not in business_days or other.date() in non_business_days:
                continue
            n_periods += 1
        
        if n_periods != self.n:
            other += timedelta(days=1) * (self.n - n_periods)
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version ensures that holidays are appropriately handled during business hour adjustments, resolving the issue with the incorrect number of periods when using the `date_range` function with periods and holidays.
