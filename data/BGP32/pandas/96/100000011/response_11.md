### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` is causing an issue with the `periods` argument in `pd.date_range` when holidays are specified. This issue is related to the GitHub issue where `pd.date_range` does not work as expected when using periods and adding a holiday.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Calculation of business days and business hours adjustment.
2. Handling of business time intervals.
3. Adjusting datetime values based on business days.
4. Incorrect behavior when holidays are involved.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect adjustments made in the `apply` function when handling business days, business hours, and holidays. This leads to an incorrect calculation of the number of periods, resulting in unexpected behavior when using `pd.date_range` with both periods and holidays.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the adjustments related to business days and business hours need to be reevaluated. Additionally, the handling of holidays should be improved to ensure that the correct number of periods is generated when using `pd.date_range`.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other) or other in self.holidays:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            other += skip_bd * timedelta(days=1)

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = (self._get_closing_time(other) - other) if r < 0 else (self._next_opening_time(other) - other)
                if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = (other - self._prev_opening_time(other)) if r > 0 else (other - self._get_closing_time(other))
                if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                     bhour_remain -= bhour
                     other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should address the issue reported in the GitHub thread by properly adjusting business days, business hours, and handling holidays when using `pd.date_range` with periods in `CustomBusinessHour`.
