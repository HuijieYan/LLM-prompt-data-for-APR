### Analysis:
The provided buggy function is `apply` in the offsets.py file of pandas library. The function is designed to adjust a given datetime object based on the business hours defined in the offset object. The issue reported on GitHub relates to unexpected behavior when using the `CustomBusinessHour` offset with holidays in a date_range function.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of holidays within the `apply` function.
2. Adjustment of datetime objects based on business hours may lead to miscalculation.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect adjustment of datetime objects in the `apply` function when holidays are involved. The function does not handle holidays properly, leading to an incorrect number of periods being calculated.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that holidays are properly considered when adjusting datetime objects.
2. Verify the logic for adjusting datetime objects within the business hours to prevent miscalculation.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if self._is_on_offset(other):
            return other

        n = self.n
        num_hours = n * 60

        if num_hours >= 0:
            next_hour = self._next_opening_time(other)
            while num_hours > 0:
                next_hour = self._next_opening_time(next_hour)
                num_hours -= 60
            return next_hour
        else:
            prev_hour = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            while num_hours < 0:
                prev_hour = self._prev_opening_time(prev_hour)
                num_hours += 60
            return prev_hour

    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version focuses on ensuring that the adjustment of datetime objects based on business hours considers holidays and correctly calculates the new datetime object according to the defined business hours. By addressing these issues, the buggy behavior reported on GitHub should be resolved.
