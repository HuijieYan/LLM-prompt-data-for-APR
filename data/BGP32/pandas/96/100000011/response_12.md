### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is related to the GitHub issue titled "Pandas date_range does not work when using periods and adding holidays." The issue highlights the problem where `pd.date_range` behaves unexpectedly when using periods and adding holidays with `pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The adjustment of `other` based on the number of business days.
2. The adjustment of remaining business hours using a `while` loop.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to incorrect adjustments made to the `other` datetime object when considering business days and holidays. This causes inconsistencies in the `pd.date_range` output, leading to unexpected behavior for the user.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug:
1. Ensure proper adjustment of `other` based on the business days.
2. Correctly adjust the remaining business hours within the `while` loop to account for holidays and business day offsets.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        businessdays = np.busday_count(other, other + np.timedelta64(n // 60, 'D'), holidays=self.holidays)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        other += np.timedelta64(bd, 'D')

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            # business hour left in this business time interval
            bhour = (
                self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            )
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                # finish adjusting if possible
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                # go to next business time interval
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version addresses the incorrect adjustment of `other` based on business days and properly handles the adjustment of remaining business hours. The corrected function should now align with the expected behavior of `pd.date_range` when using periods and holidays with `pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour`.
