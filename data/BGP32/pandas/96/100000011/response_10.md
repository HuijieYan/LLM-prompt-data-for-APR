### Analysis:
The buggy function in the `offsets.py` file of Pandas is causing an issue when combining business hours with datetime objects, resulting in unexpected behavior as reported in the GitHub issue related to `pd.date_range`. Specifically, when holidays are introduced in the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency, the number of periods generated by `pd.date_range` is incorrect.

### Identified Errors:
1. The adjustment of business days (`skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)`) is not implemented correctly when dealing with holidays.
2. The adjustment of business hours (`bhour`) within business time intervals is not properly handled, leading to incorrect date calculations.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to incorrect adjustments for both business days and business hours within the buggy function `apply`. When holidays are introduced, the logic to skip business days and adjust the remaining business hours is flawed, causing the discrepancy in the number of periods generated in `pd.date_range`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and resolve the issue reported on GitHub:
1. Properly adjust business days considering holidays.
2. Accurately calculate and adjust business hours within business time intervals.

### Corrected Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Check if other is a Timestamp object
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd, holidays=self.holidays)  # Include holidays for adjusting business days

        other = self.next_bday.normalize(other)  # Normalize the other date

        other_after_bd = other + skip_bd
        workhours_sec = self._get_business_hours_by_sec(
            self.start[self._get_loc(other_after_bd)], self.end[self._get_loc(other_after_bd)]
        )
        bhour_remain = timedelta(seconds=r * 60)

        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
            bhour = min(workhours_sec, bhour_remain.total_seconds())
            other += timedelta(seconds=bhour)
            bhour_remain -= timedelta(seconds=bhour)
            workhours_sec = self._get_business_hours_by_sec(
                self.start[self._get_loc(other)], self.end[self._get_loc(other)]
            )

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the adjustment of business days accounts for holidays, and the calculation of business hours within intervals is updated to produce the expected results when used in conjunction with `pd.date_range`.
