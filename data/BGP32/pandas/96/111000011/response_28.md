### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class which is related to managing business hours in pandas. The issue reported on GitHub involves using the `CustomBusinessHour` offset with holidays while generating date ranges. The bug seems to be related to the calculation of periods correctly when holidays are involved.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Adjusting the input `other` datetime based on the business hours and offsets.
2. Calculating the correct number of business days and hours.
3. Handling cases for positive and negative `n` values differently.
4. Iterating through business time intervals to adjust the datetime.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be caused by incorrect calculation and adjustment of the `other` datetime when determining periods based on business hours and holidays. When adjusting for business days and hours, the logic in the `apply` function is not handling holidays correctly, leading to unexpected results when generating date ranges.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that holidays are correctly accounted for when adjusting the datetime for business days.
2. Validate the calculation of business days and hours to ensure proper adjustment.
3. Check the logic for handling positive and negative `n` values to adjust the datetime accordingly.
4. Verify the iteration through business time intervals to accurately adjust the datetime.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
# Corrected version of the apply function to fix the bug
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Check for holidays in the input
        if getattr(other, "date", None) in self.holidays:
            raise ApplyTypeError(f"{other} is a holiday")
        
        n = self.n
    
        # Logic for adjusting the input datetime
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        # Business hours calculation for one day
        business_hours_per_day = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        
        # Adjust for business days
        business_days, remaining_hours = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours_per_day // 60)
        if n < 0:
            business_days, remaining_hours = -business_days, -remaining_hours
        
        # Adjust by business days first
        if business_days != 0:
            skip_bdays = BusinessDay(n=business_days)
            other += skip_bdays
        
        # Adjust remaining business hours
        remaining_hours_td = timedelta(minutes=remaining_hours)
        
        # Handle remaining business hours logic for positive and negative n values
        while remaining_hours_td != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if remaining_hours_td < bhour:
                    other += remaining_hours_td
                    remaining_hours_td = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    remaining_hours_td -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if (remaining_hours_td > bhour) or (remaining_hours_td == bhour and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0):
                    other += remaining_hours_td
                    remaining_hours_td = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    remaining_hours_td -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function should address the issue reported on GitHub by properly adjusting the datetime based on business hours, business days, and holidays.
