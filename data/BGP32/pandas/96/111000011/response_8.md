### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is a method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `offsets.py` file of the `pandas` library. The issue reported on GitHub involves unexpected behavior when using periods and adding holidays in the `pd.date_range` function with a custom business hour frequency.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of positive and negative values for `n` may not be consistent.
2. Adjustment of business days and hours based on the input conditions may have issues.
3. Calculation of business hours per day may be incorrect.
4. Handling of the `bd` and `bhour_remain` values for adjusting business days and hours may need to be reviewed.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `apply` function may lead to incorrect adjustments of dates and times when applying a custom business hour frequency with holidays in the `pd.date_range` function. This can result in unexpected behavior where the number of periods generated exceeds the expected count due to inaccurate adjustments.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, adjustments in the logic of the `apply` function need to be made to ensure correct handling of positive and negative values, proper adjustment of business days and hours, accurate calculation of business hours per day, and appropriate handling of remaining hours.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(start, end)
            for start, end in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = self._next_opening_time(other + skip_bd)

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0) and (
            (n >= 0 and other.time() < self.end[-1]) or (n < 0 and other.time() >= self.start[0])
        ):
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                bhour_remain -= bhour

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function addresses the issues mentioned and should now handle the adjustments correctly when applying a custom business hour frequency with holidays.
