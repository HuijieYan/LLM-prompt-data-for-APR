### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is responsible for calculating the next business datetime based on the provided offset. The issue described on GitHub involves the `pd.date_range` function not working correctly with periods and holidays. The buggy function is part of the `CustomBusinessHour` class in the `pandas.tseries.offsets` module, which is related to business hour offsets.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Adjusting `other` based on the `n` value.
2. Calculation of business hours and adjustment based on `n >= 0`.
3. Calculation of business hours and adjustment based on `n < 0`.
4. Handling holidays when adjusting `other`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug likely arises from how the `apply` function calculates the next business datetime, especially when holidays are involved. The incorrect handling of the number of periods in the presence of holidays can lead to extra time periods being generated.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Adjust the logic for calculating the next business datetime to ensure holidays are properly accounted for.
2. Ensure that the total number of periods remains consistent when holidays are involved.
3. Verify the adjustments made to `other` based on the provided offset and holiday schedule.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function to address the bug described in the GitHub issue:

```python
# Assuming the necessary imports are included

class CustomBusinessHour(BusinessHourMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        
            # Adjust other based on n and holidays
            holiday_offset = 0
            if hasattr(self, 'holidays') and other in self.holidays:
                holiday_offset = 1
            
            other = self._next_opening_time(other, sign=1)
            final_date = other
            
            periods_left = abs(n) + holiday_offset
            while periods_left > 0:
                if n >= 0:
                    next_opening = self._next_opening_time(final_date)
                    time_diff = next_opening - final_date
                else:
                    next_closing = self._get_closing_time(final_date)
                    time_diff = next_closing - final_date + timedelta(seconds=1)
                
                if time_diff:
                    if time_diff.total_seconds() >= periods_left * business_hours * 60:
                        # Adjust to the final datetime after calculating business hours left
                        final_date += timedelta(seconds=periods_left * business_hours * 60)
                        periods_left = 0
                    else:
                        # Move to next opening or closing based on n
                        final_date = self._next_opening_time(final_date + time_diff)
                        # Decrease periods_left by the hours spent
                        periods_left -= time_diff.total_seconds() / 60

            return final_date
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the adjustment for holidays is made by incrementing the `periods_left` when a holiday is encountered, ensuring that the total number of periods remains accurate. Additionally, the logic for handling the number of periods based on business hours and holiday adjustments has been revised to address the bug.
