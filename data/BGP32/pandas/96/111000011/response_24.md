### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the class `BusinessHourMixin` within the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is causing issues with the date_range function when adding holidays. The function is used for adjusting datetime objects based on business hour offsets.

### Identified Errors:
1. The logic for adjusting the datetime object based on business hour offsets is not handling holidays properly, leading to incorrect results.
2. The calculation for the number of business days to skip is causing inconsistencies.
3. The adjustment of remaining business hours within time intervals is not accurate, resulting in unexpected behavior.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises because the `apply` function does not handle holidays correctly when adjusting the datetime object based on business hour offsets. As a result, the date_range function behaves unexpectedly when holidays are included in the frequency.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic within the `apply` function to properly account for holidays when adjusting the datetime object based on business hour offsets. Specifically, we need to ensure that holidays are handled correctly during the adjustment process to align with the intended behavior of the date_range function.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function in the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            curr_date = other
            while n != 0:
                if n > 0:
                    curr_date = self._next_opening_time(curr_date)
                    if curr_date not in self.holidays:
                        n -= 1
                else:
                    curr_date = self._prev_opening_time(curr_date)
                    if curr_date not in self.holidays:
                        n += 1
            return curr_date
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Updated Function Explanation:
1. We iterate over the datetime object (`other`) based on the offset value (`n`) while considering holidays.
2. If the offset value (`n`) is positive, we move to the next opening time and decrement `n` only if the current date is not a holiday.
3. If the offset value (`n`) is negative, we move to the previous opening time and increment `n` only if the current date is not a holiday.
4. We continue this process until the offset value (`n`) becomes zero, ensuring correct adjustment based on business hours and holidays.

### Result:
By using this corrected version of the `apply` function, the issue reported on GitHub related to date_range function not working correctly with holidays and periods should be resolved, providing the expected behavior when adding holidays.
