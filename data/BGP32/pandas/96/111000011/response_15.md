### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas` library. It is being used in the context of custom business hour offsets. The GitHub issue describes a problem related to using `date_range` with custom business hour offsets and holidays, which results in unexpected behavior.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Adjustment of business days with `BusinessDay(n=bd)` may lead to incorrect results.
2. Calculation of business hours in `sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))` could be faulty.
3. Handling of business hour adjustments based on remaining time (`bhour_remain`) might cause issues.

### Cause of the Bug:
The issue mentioned on GitHub suggests that when using `periods` along with a custom business hour offset and holidays in `pd.date_range`, the function produces unexpected results. This behavior is likely linked to how the business hour adjustments are calculated and applied in the `apply` function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To address the issue, we need to ensure that the business hour adjustments are correctly calculated and applied within the `apply` function. Specifically, the adjustments for business days and remaining business hours need to be accurately handled.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Irrelevant portions omitted for brevity

            # adjust other to use the date part only
            other_date = other.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)

                # Correctly handle if previous date is not a business day
                while not self.is_on_offset(other_date):
                    other_date = self._next_opening_time(other_date)

                # Adding or subtracting business days
                other_date += skip_bd if n >= 0 else (skip_bd * -1)

            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

                if bhour_remain <= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and other.nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the adjustments for business days and business hours have been revised to ensure correct handling when using custom business hour offsets with `date_range`. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
