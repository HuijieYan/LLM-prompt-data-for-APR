### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas.tseries.offsets` module. The function is used to apply business hour offsets to datetime objects. The GitHub issue related to this bug involves unexpected behavior in generating date ranges when using periods and adding holidays.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Calculation of `n` and adjustment of `other` based on it.
2. Handling of business days and business hours adjustments.
3. Iterative adjustment of datetime object based on remaining time.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be related to how the function adjusts the datetime object when applying business hours. Incorrect adjustments based on `n` (number of hours), handling of business days, and business hours intervals result in unexpected dates in the output.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure correct adjustment of the input datetime object `other` based on the number of hours `n`.
2. Improve the logic for handling business days and business hours intervals.
3. Check the iterative adjustment process for correctness and accuracy.

### Corrected Version:
Here is a corrected version of the `apply` function to address the bug and align with the expected behavior explained in the GitHub issue.

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

            if n >= 0:
                while n > 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    nt = self._get_closing_time(other)
                    bhour = nt - other
                    nt += min(bhour, timedelta(minutes=n, seconds=0))
                    other = nt
                    n -= bhour.total_seconds()/60

            else:
                while n < 0:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    nt = self._get_closing_time(other)
                    bhour = other - nt
                    nt -= min(bhour, timedelta(minutes=abs(n), seconds=0))
                    other = nt
                    n += bhour.total_seconds()/60

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version focuses on the adjustment based on the number of hours `n` and properly handles the business days and business hours intervals, preventing unexpected dates in the output as reported in the GitHub issue.

By applying these adjustments and simplifying the logic, the provided corrected version should help resolve the bug associated with the behavior of the `apply` function when applied to date ranges with periods and holidays.
