### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply()` is a method within the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which is related to business hour offsets.
2. The issue reported on GitHub involves unexpected behavior when using `pd.date_range` with periods and adding holidays.
3. The problem seems to occur when adjusting the datetime based on business hours and holidays, leading to more than the specified number of periods.
4. The bug might be related to the adjustment logic based on business days and remaining business hours.
5. A strategy to fix the bug involves ensuring correct adjustments for business days and business hours intervals.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `apply()` function may occur due to incorrect adjustments when handling business days and business hours intervals. The issue from the GitHub report suggests that adding holidays leads to more periods than expected.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure proper adjustment for business days to avoid duplication of periods.
2. Verify the adjustment logic for remaining business hours within a business day.
3. Confirm that holiday handling is correctly integrated into the adjustments.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime.combine(other.date(), other.time())
        n = self.n
        
        # adjust other based on business hours and holidays
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        # calculate total business hours in a day
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        
        # adjust by business days first
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        # adjust based on business days and remaining business hours
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd
        
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        
        # adjust remaining business hours
        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                next_opening_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                next_opening_time = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))
            
            if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                other += bhour
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                if n < 0:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(next_opening_time)
            else:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            
            if n >= 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected version of the `apply()` function should now handle the adjustment logic properly, ensuring the correct number of periods is generated when using `pd.date_range` with business hour offsets and holidays.
