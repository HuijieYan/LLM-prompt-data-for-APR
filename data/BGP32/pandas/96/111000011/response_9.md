### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply(self, other)` is designed to apply business hours to a given datetime object. The function makes adjustments based on business hours, business days, opening/closing times, and remaining hours. The issue reported on GitHub relates to using the `CustomBusinessHour` offset with the `date_range` function, resulting in unexpected behavior when specifying holidays.

### Identified Potential Error Locations:
1. The logic for adjusting the datetime object based on business days and remaining business hours could be causing the unexpected behavior when holidays are involved.
2. Handling edge cases where the current time is on the offset for negative values of `n` might need further validation.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to arise from the way adjustments are made to the datetime object within the `apply(self, other)` function. The interaction with holidays and the adjustments based on business days and remaining hours might be leading to an incorrect number of periods for the `date_range` function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To address the issue with the use of holidays in the `CustomBusinessHour` offset, it is necessary to ensure that the adjustments made within the `apply(self, other)` function correctly handle the presence of holidays. Additionally, the adjustments based on business days and remaining hours need to be validated to prevent the unexpected behavior observed.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply(self, other)` function with adjustments to handle holidays and business day calculations more accurately:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                holidays = getattr(self, 'holidays', [])
                if other in holidays:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    # business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = (
                        self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    )
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        # finish adjusting if possible
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        # go to next business time interval
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    # business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if (
                        bhour_remain > bhour
                        or bhour_remain == bhour
                        and nanosecond != 0
                    ):
                        # finish adjusting if possible
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        # go to next business time interval
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(
                                other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                            )
                        )
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By incorporating adjustments to handle holidays and validating the business day calculations correctly, the corrected `apply` function should address the issue reported on GitHub.
