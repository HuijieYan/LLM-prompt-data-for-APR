### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in `offsets.py` file of the `pandas` library is responsible for the unexpected behavior observed in the GitHub issue related to date_range with periods and holidays. The function seems to have issues with adjusting business hours when holidays are involved.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Adjustment of `other` variable based on `n` value.
2. Handling of business days adjustment.
3. Adjusting remaining business hours.
4. Loop conditions for adjusting business hours.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to occur due to incorrect handling of the adjustment process when holidays are involved. The function seems to miscalculate the number of business hours based on the presence of holidays and leads to unexpected results in generating periods with date_range.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustment logic within the `apply` function correctly handles holidays and adjusts business hours accordingly. It is essential to properly consider the presence of holidays while calculating total business hours to ensure the correct number of periods in date_range.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function to resolve the issue:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Ensure correct handling of timezone and nanosecond
        if hasattr(other, 'nanosecond'):
            nanosecond = other.nanosecond
        else:
            nanosecond = 0
            
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if self._is_on_offset(other) or other.time() not in self.end:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
       
        # Calculate total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
       
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            business_day_offset = BusinessDay(n=bd, offset=self)
            other = business_day_offset.apply(other)

        # Adjust remaining business hours
        carry_over = timedelta(minutes=r)
        while carry_over != timedelta(0):
            current_bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other if n >= 0 else other - self._prev_opening_time(other)

            if abs(carry_over) >= abs(current_bhour) or (carry_over == current_bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                other += carry_over
                carry_over = timedelta(0)
            else:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + current_bhour) if n >= 0 else self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other + current_bhour))
                carry_over -= current_bhour

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, adjustments are made to handle holidays properly while considering the correct number of business hours. The corrected logic should now provide the expected behavior when generating periods with date_range in the presence of holidays.
