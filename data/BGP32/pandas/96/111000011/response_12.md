### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas` library. The issue reported on GitHub involves unexpected behavior when using `pd.date_range` with periods and adding holidays.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling adjustment for business days and business hours
2. Calculating business hours in a day
3. Logic for moving to next business time interval
4. Adjusting `bhour_remain` based on business hours left

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be related to how the business days and business hours are adjusted. The calculation for adjusting business days and business hours within the `apply` function could be causing the unexpected behavior reported on GitHub.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments for business days and business hours are correctly calculated and applied. Specifically, reviewing the logic for adjusting to the next business day and the remaining business hours in each interval might help resolve the issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is a corrected version of the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime.combine(other.date(), other.time())  # Replace with datetime.combine for retaining date
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n), businesshours)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, adjustments for business days and hours have been revised to handle scenarios where holidays might impact the calculation of periods correctly. This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub.
