### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is implemented in the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The issue reported on GitHub relates to unexpected behavior when using `pd.date_range` with periods and holidays.
3. The bug in the `apply` function may be causing the unexpected behavior reported in the GitHub issue.
4. The `apply` function should adjust the datetime based on business hours, but it seems to be incorrectly handling this adjustment.

### Identified Issue:
The bug in the `apply` function may be causing incorrect datetime adjustments, leading to unexpected results when utilizing business hours with periods and holidays in `pd.date_range`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug may stem from incorrect calculation or handling of business hours and adjustments within the `apply` function, which may result in the datetime being incorrectly adjusted during iterations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure correct adjustment of the input datetime based on business hours.
2. Verify the handling of business hours increments and decrements.
3. Debug and test the function with different scenarios to ensure the adjustments are correct and aligned with the business hours.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected apply function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            # Reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                
                if bhour <= bhour_remain:
                    other += bhour
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                else:
                    if n >= 0:
                        other += bhour_remain
                    else:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour))
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version aims to handle the business hours adjustment correctly, ensuring that the datetime adjustments align with the specified business hours and resolves the unexpected behavior reported in the GitHub issue.
