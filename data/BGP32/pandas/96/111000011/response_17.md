### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `offsets.py` file of Pandas library. The function is associated with business hour calculations and adjustments in time based on specified conditions. The function seems to have a bug related to handling holidays correctly when adjusting datetimes.

### Identified issue:
The bug appears to be related to how holidays are handled within the `apply` function. The behavior described in the GitHub issue suggests that when holidays are added to the calculation, the number of periods in the date range generated by `date_range` is impacted. This indicates an error in how holidays are accounted for during the calculation of business hours.

### Bug Cause:
1. The `_get_business_hours_by_sec` function is used to calculate the total business hours in a day. If holidays are not properly considered in this calculation, it can lead to incorrect results.
2. The condition where holidays need to be checked and adjusted is not appropriately handled, causing the function to misinterpret the number of periods when holidays are involved.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Validate the logic for considering holidays within calculations related to business hours.
2. Ensure that the adjustment of time intervals and business days accounts for holidays accurately.
3. Test the corrected function using scenarios involving holidays to verify that the behavior aligns with the expected results.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,

        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other.replace(microsecond=999999)  # set microsecond to maximum
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en, other)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                break
            else:
                other += bhour
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    while not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))
                        
            bhour_remain -= bhour

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, I have adjusted the logic related to holidays and the calculation of business hours within the `apply` function. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and provide a more accurate adjustment of time considering holidays.
