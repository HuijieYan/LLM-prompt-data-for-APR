### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class of the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is related to custom business hours.
2. The issue reported on GitHub involves unexpected behavior when using `pd.date_range` with periods and holidays.
3. The bug seems to be causing the incorrect generation of dates with the addition of holidays and multiple periods.
4. The buggy function is responsible for adjusting business hours but fails to account for holidays properly, leading to the issue reported on GitHub.
5. To fix the bug, the `apply` function should be modified to correctly handle holidays while calculating the dates within the business hours.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is likely caused by the flawed handling of holidays in the `apply` function. When adjusting dates within business hours, holidays are not considered, leading to the unexpected output observed in the GitHub issue.
- The incorrect adjustment of dates within business hours causes the additional periods to be generated incorrectly after encountering holidays.

### Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, the `apply` function should be updated to handle holidays appropriately. When adjusting dates within business hours, account for holidays to ensure the correct generation of periods.
- Modify the logic to skip holidays while adjusting the dates to prevent the issue reported on GitHub.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if self.holidays and other.date() in self.holidays:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Date is a holiday")
        
        # omitted existing code for brevity
        
        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                # handle holiday during adjustment
                while self.holidays and other.date() in self.holidays:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                # handle holiday during adjustment
                while self.holidays and other.date() in self.holidays:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # remaining code remains the same

    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By incorporating the fix above, the `apply` function should now handle holidays correctly while adjusting dates within business hours, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
