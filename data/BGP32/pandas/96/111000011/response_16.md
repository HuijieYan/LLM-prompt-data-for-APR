### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is a method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file. The function is related to computing business hours and adjusting datetime objects accordingly. The buggy behavior reported in the GitHub issue seems to be related to the incorrect calculation of business hours in the presence of holidays.

The bug seems to arise from the logic used to handle holidays when adjusting the datetime object in the `apply` function. The incorrect handling of holidays results in an incorrect number of periods being generated when using `pd.date_range`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The buggy function does not properly adjust the datetime object when encountering holidays. This leads to an incorrect calculation of business hours, resulting in the generation of more periods than expected in the `pd.date_range`. The issue is specifically related to the adjustment of the datetime object when holidays are encountered.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the logic for handling holidays needs to be revised in the `apply` function. Proper adjustments should be made when encountering holidays to ensure that the datetime object is correctly adjusted based on the business hours and holidays information.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version incorporates a fix for adjusting the datetime object correctly in the presence of holidays

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        ...

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            ...
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other) or other.date() in self.holidays:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            ...
            if other.time() in self.start or other.date() in self.holidays:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        ...

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, we have added a check to handle holidays when adjusting the datetime object. If the date part of the datetime object is found in the list of holidays, additional adjustments are made to ensure the correct computation of business hours and periods. This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
