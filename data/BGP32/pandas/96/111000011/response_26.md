## Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is not handling holidays correctly while adjusting the business hours. This bug is causing the issue reported on GitHub related to unexpected behavior when adding holidays to generate date ranges with `pd.date_range`.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. Handling of holidays in the adjustment logic.
2. Calculation of business days and remaining business hours.
3. Adjusting the datetime based on the remaining business hours.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug is occurring due to insufficient handling of holidays in the `apply` function. When adjusting the datetime based on business days and remaining hours, holidays are not considered, leading to a wrong calculation of periods resulting in unexpected output.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `apply` function to properly handle holidays. When adjusting the datetime based on business days and remaining hours, we should skip the holidays to get the correct number of periods.

## Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                # midnight business hour may not on BusinessDay
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain

            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    # business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = (
                        self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    )
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        # finish adjusting if possible
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        # go to next business time interval
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                        if other.date() in self.holidays:
                            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    # business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if (
                        bhour_remain > bhour
                        or bhour_remain == bhour
                        and nanosecond != 0
                    ):
                        # finish adjusting if possible
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        # go to next business time interval
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(
                                other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                            )
                        )
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, I added a check for holidays in the adjustment loops to correctly skip holidays while adjusting the datetime based on business days and business hours. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to unexpected behavior when adding holidays to generate date ranges with `pd.date_range`.
