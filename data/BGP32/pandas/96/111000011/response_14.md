### Analysis:
- The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is a method that applies business hour offsets based on the input datetime.
- The buggy function performs adjustments based on business hours and business days, handling positive and negative offsets.
- The bug mentioned in the GitHub issue is related to using the `pd.date_range` function with a CustomBusinessHour frequency and holidays causing unexpected behavior in the number of periods generated.

### Error Location:
- The bug likely occurs due to incorrect adjustments in the `apply` function when dealing with negative offsets and the presence of holidays.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug arises from the incorrect calculations and adjustments in the `apply` function when handling negative offsets with holidays.
- The holiday logic and adjustments for negative offsets are not properly implemented, leading to the unexpected behavior in generating periods.

### Suggested Fix Strategy:
1. Check and correct the logic related to negative offsets and holiday handling in the `apply` function.
2. Ensure that the adjustments for negative offsets and holidays are accurately calculated to avoid the issue reported in the GitHub bug.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        adjusted_dt = other

        if self._is_on_offset(adjusted_dt) and adjusted_dt.time() in self.start:
            adjusted_dt = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_dt)

        if self.n < 0:
            midnight_adjustment = timedelta(seconds=1)
            if adjusted_dt.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(adjusted_dt):
                adjusted_dt = self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_dt)
        
        bd, r = divmod(abs(self.n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        
        if self.n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            if self.n >= 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                adjusted_dt = skip_bd.rollforward(adjusted_dt)
            else:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=-bd)
                adjusted_dt = skip_bd.rollback(adjusted_dt)

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if self.n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_dt)) - adjusted_dt
                next_opening = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_dt)
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_dt) - adjusted_dt
                next_opening = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(adjusted_dt - midnight_adjustment))

            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                adjusted_dt += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                adjusted_dt = next_opening

        return adjusted_dt
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Changes Made:
- Adjusted the logic for handling negative offsets and holiday adjustments.
- Ensured proper adjustments are made for negative offsets with holidays.
- Implemented correct calculations for business days and remaining business hours.
- Updated the return value to the adjusted datetime `adjusted_dt`.

By making these changes, the corrected version of the `apply` function should now handle business hour offsets correctly, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
