### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is responsible for calculating the next business hour given a specific datetime input. The issue reported on GitHub pertains to unexpected behavior in date calculations when using the `pd.date_range` function with periods and holidays while using custom business hour offsets.

### Identified Error:
The issue seems to be caused by incorrect handling of business hours and holiday constraints while calculating the next business hour. Incorrect adjustments are made based on the holiday and business hour constraints, leading to extra periods being generated.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments made based on holidays and business hours are accurately implemented, and the correct number of periods is generated without any extra periods. This involves properly adjusting the datetime based on the holiday constraints and business hours.

### Corrected Version:

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # adjust the input datetime based on business hour constraints
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), 60)

        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)

        # check if datetime falls on a holiday and adjust accordingly
        if not self.is_on_offset(other):
            prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            remain = other - prev_open
            other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
        else:
            other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This modified function should address the issue reported on GitHub by accurately adjusting the datetime based on the holiday and business hour constraints, ensuring that the correct number of periods is generated without any extra periods.
