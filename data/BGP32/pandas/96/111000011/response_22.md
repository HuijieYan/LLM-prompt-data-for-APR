### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `apply` method within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The function is meant to apply business hour offsets to a given datetime object.
3. The bug causes unexpected behavior when adding holidays to the business hour offset, leading to incorrect time adjustments and producing more periods than expected.
4. The issue reported on GitHub involves using `pd.date_range` with periods and adding holidays leading to unexpected results.

### Identified Errors:
1. Incorrect adjustment of the datetime object based on the holidays and business hour offsets.
2. Calculation of business hours and adjustment of the datetime object leads to incorrect results.
3. The function does not handle holidays properly, causing the unexpected behavior reported in the GitHub issue.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. When adding holidays to business hour offsets, the adjustment logic does not correctly account for holidays leading to the incorrect calculation of business hours.
2. The handling of adjustments based on positive or negative business days is causing the error in counting periods and producing incorrect results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure holidays are properly handled when adjusting datetime objects based on business hour offsets.
2. Simplify the adjustment logic to accurately calculate business hours and adjust the datetime object according to positive or negative business days.
3. Update the adjustment process to avoid discrepancies in identifying business days and hours.

            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function includes adjustments for holidays and fixes the logic for calculating business hours and adjusting the datetime object based on business day offsets.
