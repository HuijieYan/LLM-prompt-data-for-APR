### Analysis:
The buggy function in the `BusinessHourMixin` class, named `apply`, is responsible for adjusting datetime objects based on business hours. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when using this function in combination with pandas `date_range` and holiday parameters, the number of periods generated is incorrect.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Adjusting the datetime objects based on business hours.
2. Handling the business days and remaining business hours.
3. Iterating over business time intervals to adjust the datetime objects.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to incorrect adjustments made to business hours when holidays are specified. The way the function processes business days and remaining hours may lead to an incorrect number of periods generated.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure proper adjustment of datetime objects based on business hours.
2. Correctly handle business days and remaining hours to avoid incorrect period generation.
3. Verify the logic for iterating over business time intervals and adjusting datetime objects accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if self._is_on_offset(prev_open):  # Check if previous open time is on offset
                    other += skip_bd
                else:
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += timedelta(minutes=r)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `apply` function should now properly adjust datetime objects based on business hours, including handling holidays and ensuring the correct number of periods generated when used in combination with `date_range`. It addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue by improving the logic for adjusting datetime objects.
