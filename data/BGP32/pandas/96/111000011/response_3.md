### Analysis:
The buggy function in the `BusinessHourMixin` class of the `offsets.py` file is causing issues with generating date ranges using `pd.date_range` when both periods and holidays are specified. This is related to the GitHub issue where date ranges are not working as expected when holidays are added along with periods.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Calculation of business hours.
2. Adjusting for business days.
3. Adjusting for remaining business hours.
4. Handling the edge conditions.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to incorrect logic in adjusting the date for periods and holidays based on business hours. The adjustment calculations are not correctly handling the cases where both periods and holidays are involved, leading to incorrect date range generation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Properly adjust the datetime for business days before handling remaining business hours.
2. Include correct logic for handling both positive and negative business hours.
3. Ensure the adjustment meets the criteria for both periods and holidays.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function to fix the bug based on the analysis and suggestions mentioned above:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year, other.month, other.day, other.hour, other.minute, other.second, other.microsecond
            )
            n = self.n

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n), len(self.start))
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            curr_open = other
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(curr_open) - curr_open
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (n == 0 and bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour
                        curr_open += bhour
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                    else:
                        curr_open = self._next_opening_time(curr_open) + bhour_remain

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version aims to fix the issue related to date ranges generation when periods and holidays are specified, ensuring a proper adjustment for business days and remaining business hours.
