## Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is intended to adjust a given datetime object based on the business hour information provided by the `CustomBusinessHour` offset class. However, the bug in this function causes the adjustment to fail in certain scenarios, leading to incorrect output.

## Identified issue:
The main issue in the buggy function lies in the calculation and adjustment of business hours in the presence of negative offsets. When the offset `n` is negative, the function fails to correctly adjust the datetime object to the previous business day and calculate the remaining business hours.

## Bug Cause:
1. When `n` is negative, the function incorrectly handles the adjustment to the previous business day. It fails to correctly identify the timing of `self.start` and makes wrong adjustments, leading to incorrect results.
2. The calculation of remaining business hours `bhour_remain` is also flawed when `n` is negative, resulting in incorrect adjustments.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly adjust the datetime object for negative offsets, ensuring that the correct business day is identified and the remaining business hours are calculated accurately. Proper checks and adjustments should be made to handle the negative offset case effectively.

## Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Handle adjustments for negative offsets
        if self.n < 0 and other.time() not in self.start:
            other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
        n = self.n
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n) * 60, businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd
        
        # Remaining business hours adjustment
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            bhour = (
                self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            )
            if n < 0:
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
            if bhour_remain < bhour or bhour_remain == bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                bhour_remain -= bhour

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With the corrected version of the `apply` function, the issue related to negative offsets should be resolved, and the function should now pass the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.
