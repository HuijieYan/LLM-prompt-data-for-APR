## Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is designed to adjust a datetime object based on a custom business hour offset. It performs several calculations and adjustments to ensure the resulting datetime is aligned with the business hours specified.

## Issues:
1. The function has a logic error in the adjustment of the datetime object based on the business hour offset, leading to incorrect results when applied to custom business hours.
2. The conditional checks and adjustments within the loops for handling positive and negative offsets are not accurately capturing the intended behavior.

## Bug cause:
Due to incorrect logic within the function, the adjustments made to the datetime object are not correctly aligning it with the specified custom business hours, causing the test to fail.

## Fix strategy:
1. Revise the logic for adjusting the datetime object based on positive and negative offsets to ensure it aligns properly with the specified business hours.
2. Make sure the adjustments are correctly handling edge cases and transitions between business hours.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            other += skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            bhour = (
                self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            )
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making the above corrections to the `apply` function, it should now correctly adjust the datetime object based on the custom business hour offset provided.
