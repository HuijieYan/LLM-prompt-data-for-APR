## Analysing the buggy function and its relationship with the failing test
The buggy function `apply` is responsible for adjusting datetime objects based on a custom business hour offset. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` generates a DatetimeIndex using the custom business hour offset and expects certain datetime values in the result.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. Incorrect usage of `businesshours` variable.
2. Improper handling of adjusting business days.
3. Issues with adjusting remaining business hours.
4. Possible miscalculation in the while loop conditions.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is likely caused by incorrect adjustments made within the `apply` function while handling business days and remaining business hours. This results in incorrect datetime values being returned, causing the failing test to fail.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Check the business hour calculations and adjustments.
2. Verify the logic for adjusting business days and remaining hours.
3. Review the while loop conditions for accuracy.
4. Ensure proper handling of business day offsets.
