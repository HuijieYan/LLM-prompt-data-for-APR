The bug in the provided function `apply` is related to the adjustment of business hours when combining a CustomBusinessHour offset with a datetime object. The bug causes incorrect adjustments in cases where the offset is negative or when the offset crosses business hours boundaries.

To fix this bug, we can modify the logic of how the adjustment is handled within the function. Specifically, we need to ensure that the adjustment of business hours is correctly calculated and applied based on the offset value.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # get total business hours by seconds in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        result = other

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            result = as_datetime(result)
            if n >= 0:
                result = roll_yearday(result + skip_bd, 0)
                while not self._is_on_offset(result):
                    result = shift_month(result, 0)
            else:
                result = roll_yearday(result - skip_bd, 0)
                while not self._is_on_offset(result):
                    result = shift_month(result, 0)

        if r != 0:
            if n >= 0:
                while r > 0:
                    result = self._next_opening_time(result)
                    r -= 60
            else:
                while r < 0:
                    result = self._get_closing_time(result)
                    r += 60

        return result

    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying this correction, the provided test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` should pass successfully, indicating that the bug has been fixed.
