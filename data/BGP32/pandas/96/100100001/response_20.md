## Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the offsets.py file is intended to adjust a datetime object based on a custom business hour offset. The function appears to have issues with correctly adjusting business hours, resulting in incorrect output.

## Identified Issues:
1. Incorrect handling of business hour adjustment for negative offsets.
2. Business days adjustment logic is flawed.
3. Incorrect comparison and adjustment of remaining business hours.

## Bug Cause:
The bug seems to stem from incorrect logic in handling negative offsets, improper adjustment of business days, and the flawed comparison of remaining business hours leading to incorrect datetime adjustments.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the business days logic for negative offsets.
2. Correct the comparison and adjustment of remaining business hours in the while loops.

## Corrected Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            other = self.nth_open(other, bd)

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self.nth_opening(other, 1)
        else:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = other - self._get_closing_time(other)
                if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                    other -= bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self.nth_opening(other, -1)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Now, with the corrected `apply` function, the test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` should pass successfully.
