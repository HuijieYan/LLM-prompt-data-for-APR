## Analysis:
The buggy function is `apply` and it is intended to adjust a datetime object based on the business hour offset provided. The function checks if the `other` input is a datetime object and then performs various adjustments based on the business hour offset `n`.

## Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect manipulation of the datetime object `other` inside the function. The function fails to adjust the datetime object correctly when dealing with negative offsets and specific edge cases related to business hours. This leads to incorrect outputs when using the function in scenarios like the failing test provided.

## Solution:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustment of the datetime object `other` is done correctly for all cases, including negative offsets and edge cases related to business hours.

## Updated Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        
        # adjust other to reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(
            hour=self.hour,
            minute=self.minute,
            second=self.second,
            microsecond=self.microsecond
        )

        # adjust other based on the business hour offset n
        if n >= 0:
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = self.rollforward(other)
            other += skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other if n >= 0 else other - self._get_closing_time(other)
            adjust = min(bhour, bhour_remain)
            other += adjust
            bhour_remain -= adjust
            if bhour_remain == timedelta(0) and n < 0:
                other -= self.offset + self.offset
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By updating the function as shown above, the bug in the original function should be fixed, and it should now pass the failing test provided.
