## Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is responsible for adjusting a given datetime based on the custom business hour offset. The bug occurs when trying to calculate the adjusted datetime based on the provided business hour offset. The calculation and adjustment logic within the function has an issue that causes the test case to fail.

## Identified Bug:
The bug lies in the logic related to adjusting the datetime based on the business hour offset. In particular, the calculation of remaining business hours to adjust and the subsequent adjustment process is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

## Cause of Bug:
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of remaining business hours to adjust during the adjustment process. This results in the adjusted datetime being calculated incorrectly, leading to a mismatch with the expected result in the test case.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the logic for calculating remaining business hours and adjusting the datetime needs to be revised. It is crucial to accurately calculate and adjust the remaining business hours while considering both positive and negative offsets to ensure the correct adjustment of datetime based on the custom business hour offset.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # Adjust other to reduce the number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Get total business hours by seconds in one business day
        business_hours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other if n >= 0 else other - self._next_opening_time(other)
            if abs(bhour.total_seconds()) <= abs(bhour_remain.total_seconds()):
                other += bhour
                bhour_remain -= bhour
            else:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hours with datetime")
```

By correcting the adjustment logic for remaining business hours in the function `apply`, the corrected version should now pass the failing test without any issues.
