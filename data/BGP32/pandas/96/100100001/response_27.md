## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is used to apply the custom business hour offset to a datetime input.
2. The bug seems to be related to adjusting the business hours and handling the business day offsets.
3. The failing test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is testing the behavior of generating date ranges with custom business hours.
4. The bug might be related to how the function handles adjusting the business hours and business days.
5. The test case failure indicates that the function is not adjusting the business hours correctly when encountering holidays.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the `apply` function seems to be related to how it adjusts business hours and handles business day offsets. In the failing test case, the function is not adjusting the business hours correctly when encountering holidays. This could be due to incorrect logic in handling holidays and business hours adjustments.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug:
1. Ensure that the function correctly handles holidays and adjusts business hours accordingly.
2. Check the logic related to adjusting business days and hours based on the input parameters.
3. Verify that the function properly calculates the total business hours and adjusts the datetime input accordingly.

## Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # handle edge condition for nanosecond
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        business_hours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = self._next_bday(n=bd)
            if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

            if bhour_remain < bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making these adjustments to the `apply` function, it should now handle holidays and adjust business hours correctly. This corrected version should pass the failing test case.
