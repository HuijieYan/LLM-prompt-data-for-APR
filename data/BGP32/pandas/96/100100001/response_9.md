## Analysis:
- The buggy function `apply` is supposed to adjust a datetime object based on a custom business hour offset.
- The failing test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is trying to create a date range using a `CustomBusinessHour` offset that starts at 15:00 and includes a holiday on November 26th.
- The buggy function is not handling the case where the `other` datetime object falls on a holiday properly, leading to incorrect adjustments.


## Bug Cause:
- The buggy function does not handle holidays correctly and does not skip holidays while adjusting the datetime object based on the custom business hour offset.


## Fix Strategy:
- Introduce a logic to skip holidays when adjusting the datetime object using the custom business hour offset.
- Check if the `other` datetime object falls on a holiday and make necessary adjustments.


## Corrected Version:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # Check if other is a holiday and skip if necessary
        if other.date() in self.holidays:
            return self._skip_holiday(other, n)

        # rest of the code remains unchanged
        ...
        
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

    
def _skip_holiday(self, other, n):
    """
    Skip the holiday date when adjusting based on business hour offset
    """
    holiday = other.date()
    direction = 1 if n >= 0 else -1

    while holiday in self.holidays:
        holiday += timedelta(days=direction)

    # Adjust based on the next valid day
    if n >= 0:
        return self._next_opening_time(datetime.combine(holiday, time(0, 0)) + self)
    else:
        return self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(datetime.combine(holiday, time(0, 0)))) - timedelta(seconds=1)
```

After making the above changes, the corrected version of the `apply` function should handle holidays correctly and pass the failing test case.
