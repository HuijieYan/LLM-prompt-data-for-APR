### Analysis:
1. The `apply` function is defined to handle the adjustment of business hours based on a given datetime object. It uses various conditions to adjust the datetime based on the business hours offset.
2. The function contains multiple conditional blocks to handle different cases of adjusting the datetime object based on the business hours.
3. The bug likely arises from incorrect handling of the adjustment logic within the function, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.
4. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is related to creating a date range with custom business hours, where the adjustment is not being applied correctly, resulting in mismatched datetime values in the output.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect adjustment logic within the `apply` function. Specifically, the logic for adjusting the datetime object based on the business hours offset is not handling all cases correctly, leading to incorrect results.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the adjustment logic within the `apply` function needs to be reviewed and corrected to ensure that the datetime object is adjusted properly based on the business hours offset. It is important to consider all possible cases and edge conditions to ensure the correct adjustment.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        
        n = self.n
        
        if n >= 0:
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if self._is_on_offset(other):
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            else:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        
        delta_seconds = n * self._get_business_seconds()
        other += timedelta(seconds=delta_seconds)
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By simplifying and correcting the adjustment logic in the corrected version, we ensure that the datetime object is correctly adjusted based on the business hours offset. This corrected version should now pass the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.
