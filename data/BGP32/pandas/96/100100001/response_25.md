### Analysis:
The buggy `apply` function in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is intended to adjust a given datetime based on a custom business hour offset. The function calculates the adjusted datetime based on the business hour offset provided.

### Identified Issue:
The issue in the `apply` function seems to be related to adjusting the datetime based on the business hour offset. The function is not correctly handling the adjustment of the datetime when dealing with negative business hours. This results in the incorrect adjustment of the datetime.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of negative business hours in the `apply` function. When trying to adjust the datetime for negative business hours, the function skips some necessary steps, resulting in an incorrect adjusted datetime.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustment logic in the `apply` function correctly handles negative business hours. This may involve revisiting the logic for adjusting the datetime based on positive and negative business hours separately and making necessary corrections.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function with the bug fixed:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = (
                    self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                )
            else:
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other - bhour)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Result:
With the bug fixed in the `apply` function, it should now correctly adjust the datetime based on the business hour offset provided. The corrected function should now pass the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in the `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py` file.
