## Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is responsible for adjusting time offsets based on business hours. The function fails when the `other` input is a `datetime` object.

## Bugs Identified:
1. Inconsistent usage of `self.next_bday.is_on_offset` instead of `self._is_on_offset`.
2. Incorrect calculation in the adjustment process, leading to incorrect results.

## Bug Explanation:
The function fails to adjust the `datetime` input accurately due to incorrect calculations and condition checks. This results in an incorrect output when trying to calculate business hours with the provided input.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Fix the condition checks to use `self._is_on_offset` consistently.
2. Adjust the business hour calculation and adjustment logic to ensure accurate results.

## Corrected Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = (
                    self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                )
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if (
                    bhour_remain > bhour
                    or bhour_remain == bhour
                    and nanosecond != 0
                ):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(
                        self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                    )

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After making these corrections, the `apply` function should now handle the adjustment of business hours accurately and provide the correct output when passed a `datetime` object.
