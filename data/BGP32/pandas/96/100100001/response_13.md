The bug in the provided `apply` function arises from the incorrect adjustments made to the `other` datetime object. The condition checks and adjustments for positive and negative business days are causing the failure in the test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`. 

The strategy for fixing the bug would involve correctly adjusting the `other` datetime object based on positive or negative business days while accounting for the specific time intervals of business hours.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other.replace(second=0, microsecond=0) - timedelta(days=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = pd.offsets.BusinessDay(n=bd)
            prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            if skip_bd.rollforward(other) == other:
                other = other - pd.offsets.DateOffset(days=1)
            other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
                bhour = next_opening - other
            else:
                bhour = other - self._prev_closing_time(other)
            if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                other = next_opening
                bhour_remain -= bhour
            else:
                other = other + bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With the corrected version above, the `apply` function should now correctly adjust datetime objects based on positive or negative business days and pass the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.
