The bug in the `apply` function arises from the incorrect handling of the custom business hours in the `CustomBusinessHour` object when calculating the next business time intervals. The function does not consider the specified start time for the custom business hours, leading to incorrect adjustments.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly account for the custom start time when determining the next business time intervals.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        start_time = other.replace(hour=self.start_hour, minute=self.start_minute)

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if start_time.time() == self.end_time or not (start_time >= self.start_time):
                other = self._next_opening_time(start_time)
        else:
            if start_time.time() == self.start_time:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not (start_time >= self.start_time):
                other = self._next_opening_time(start_time)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # rest of the function remains the same
        # ...

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, we adjust the initial `start_time` based on the specified start time for the custom business hours, ensuring that the calculations for the next business time intervals align with the custom settings.

After applying this fix, the `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` test should pass successfully.
