The cause of the bug in the `apply` function is that it incorrectly handles the adjustment of business hours when dealing with negative business days. This leads to an incorrect calculation of the resulting datetime, causing the test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic for adjusting business hours when `n` is negative and handle the case where the business hour spans multiple time intervals correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = other + skip_bd
            else:
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            current_opening_time = self._prev_opening_time(other) if n >= 0 else self._next_opening_time(other)
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(current_opening_time) - other
            if n >= 0 or bhour_remain >= bhour:
                # Adjusting the full bhour interval
                other = other + bhour
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self.rollforward(other)
            else:
                # Adjusting a part of the bhour interval
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function should fix the bug and pass the failing test function.
