## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is a method of a class and it is using an unknown decorator `@apply_wraps`, which might be causing issues.
2. The function is trying to adjust business hours with a given datetime based on the provided offset.
3. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is creating a custom business hour frequency and generating a date range based on that frequency. The test fails because the `apply` function is not correctly handling the adjustments for custom business hours.
4. The bug seems to be related to how the function is handling adjustments for positive and negative offsets, as well as how it calculates and adjusts the business hours.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly adjusts the given datetime based on the custom business hour offset provided.

## Fix:
```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import pandas as pd
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=n)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    # go to next business time interval
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour:
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    # go to next business time interval
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

# Applying the fixed function to the original buggy file
BusinessDay.offset = apply
```

By making these changes to the `apply` function and assigning it to the `offset` class attribute, we should be able to ensure that the adjustments for custom business hours work correctly with the provided test case.
