The bug in the provided function `apply` stems from incorrect logic for adjusting business hours when dealing with negative offsets. The function fails to adjust the time properly, leading to incorrect results. The issue is mainly in the section where the function calculates the remaining business hours (`bhour_remain`) and adjusts the time accordingly.

To fix this bug, we need to correct the logic for adjusting the remaining business hours in both positive and negative offset cases. Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            other += skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0) and self._is_on_offset(other):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                else:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
        else:
            while bhour_remain < timedelta(0) and self._is_on_offset(other):
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if (
                    bhour_remain <= bhour
                    or (bhour_remain == timedelta(0) and nanosecond != 0)
                ):
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))
                    bhour_remain += bhour
                else:
                    other -= bhour
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version handles the adjustment of business hours accurately in both positive and negative offset scenarios. It addresses the incorrect adjustments that were causing the failing test to fail.
