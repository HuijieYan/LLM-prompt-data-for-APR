### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The bug seems to relate to how the `apply` function handles the adjustment of dates based on business hours and holidays.
3. The GitHub issue highlights an incorrect behavior specifically when using `pd.date_range` with periods, custom business hours, and holidays. It results in unexpected additional periods due to how the adjustment is handled within the `apply` function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to revisit the logic in the `apply` function concerning the adjustment of dates based on business hours and holidays.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the adjustment logic within the `apply` function, especially the parts related to handling positive and negative business hours.
2. Ensure that the adjustment considers holidays correctly to avoid producing incorrect periods.
3. Address any issues related to moving between business time intervals and adjusting dates accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd, holidays=self.holidays)  # Pass holidays to skip BusinessDay
                other = skip_bd.apply(other)
    
            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                        # finish adjusting if possible
                        other += bhour_remain
                        break  # Exit loop
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        # finish adjusting if possible
                        other += bhour_remain
                        break  # Exit loop
    
                # move to the next business time interval
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                bhour_remain -= bhour
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version includes passing the holidays information to the `BusinessDay` object and ensuring correct adjustment and looping logic to handle business hour adjustments based on the start and end times and factoring in potential holidays.

By making these adjustments, the `apply` function should now handle business hour adjustments more accurately when holidays are involved, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
