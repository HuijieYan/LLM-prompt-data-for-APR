### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` within the class `BusinessHourMixin` is responsible for adjusting the input datetime based on business hours and minutes specified. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when using `pd.date_range` with periods and adding holidays, the function produces unexpected results by generating more periods than specified. This behavior indicates a bug within the `apply` function.

### Error Location:
The problematic part of the function seems to be the adjustment of the new date when the number of business hours is negative. The logic for handling negative business hours and adjusting the date accordingly appears to be faulty, leading to the unexpected behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the function to incorrectly calculate the adjusted datetime when a negative number of business hours is provided. This results in the function generating more periods than expected when used in combination with `pd.date_range` and holidays.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to carefully review the logic for adjusting the datetime when dealing with negative business hours. The adjustment process needs to correctly handle the situation when subtracting business hours from the input date while considering holidays.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function with the fix implemented:
```python
# Import necessary modules here

def apply_wraps(func):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # Other functions here

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Initial logic remains the same

            # Adjusted logic when n is negative
            if n < 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other -= bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._prev_opening_time(other - bhour + timedelta(seconds=1))

            # Calculate remaining business hours and adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the logic for handling negative business hours and ensuring correct adjustments in the datetime calculations, this corrected version should address the issue reported on GitHub related to the unexpected behavior when using `pd.date_range` with periods and holidays.
