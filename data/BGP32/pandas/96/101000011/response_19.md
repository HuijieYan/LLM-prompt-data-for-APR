### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is responsible for the unexpected behavior where adding holidays to `CustomBusinessHour` offsets results in incorrect period counts in `date_range`. This issue was highlighted in the GitHub post, where adding holidays led to more periods in the output.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Calculating `bd` and `r` may lead to incorrect values.
2. Adjusting the timestamp based on business days and business hours might be causing the issue.
3. The handling of holidays within the `apply` function needs to be checked.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug might be caused due to incorrect adjustments being made to the timestamp `other` when dealing with negative business hours, especially in the presence of holidays. This may lead to the function generating more periods than expected.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure proper handling of adjustments for negative business hours.
2. Check the holiday handling logic to prevent abnormal period count.
3. Calculate the remaining business hours accurately.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime.combine(other.date(), other.time())
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            business_hours_seconds = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 3600), business_hours_seconds // 3600)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        break
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        break
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version addresses the issues related to handling negative business hours and the adjustments during the processing of the timestamp `other`. Make sure to thoroughly test this corrected function for the desired functionality.
