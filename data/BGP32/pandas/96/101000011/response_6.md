### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is used as part of custom business hour logic in pandas. The issue reported on GitHub involves using `pd.date_range` with the `periods` parameter and adding holidays, resulting in unexpected behavior.

### Identified potential error locations:
1. The logic inside the `apply` function that adjusts the datetime based on business hours seems to have issues handling holidays correctly.
2. The adjustment in the function based on business days and business hours might not consider holidays effectively.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug seems to stem from the improper handling of holidays within the custom business hour logic. The existing logic does not appropriately adjust for holidays during datetime calculations, leading to incorrect results when using `pd.date_range` with both periods and holidays.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the `apply` function needs to be updated to consider holidays correctly during datetime adjustments. Proper logic should be implemented to skip over holidays and adjust business hours accordingly to ensure accurate results in scenarios where holidays are involved in business hour calculations.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function with added logic to handle holidays:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year, other.month, other.day, other.hour, other.minute, other.second, other.microsecond
        )
        n = self.n

        if self._is_on_offset(other) and other not in self.holidays:
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Adjust for holidays
        while other in self.holidays:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        
        # remaining logic remains same

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, holidays are taken into account during datetime adjustments within the business hour logic. This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub related to unexpected behavior when using `pd.date_range` with periods and holidays in custom business hours.
