### Analysis:
The bug is related to the `apply` method within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file. The issue reported on GitHub involves a discrepancy between the number of periods generated by `pd.date_range` when combining the CustomBusinessHour frequency with holidays.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Adjusting the datetime object `other` based on the provided logic for positive and negative n values.
2. Calculating business hours and adjusting `other` based on those hours.
3. Handling the case when business days need to be skipped.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `apply` method is likely causing incorrect adjustments to the DateTime object when handling business days, business hours, and determining closing times. This unoptimized handling results in unexpected behavior when combining holidays with CustomBusinessHour frequency.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Review the logic used for adjusting the `other` DateTime object based on the provided `n` value.
2. Ensure that the calculation of business hours and related adjustments is accurate.
3. Validate the handling of business days to skip when applying the CustomBusinessHour frequency.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` method that addresses the bug:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            skip_days = 0

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(days=1)  # Move back a day

                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            while True:
                corrected_time = None

                if n % self._get_business_hours_by_sec(self.start[0], self.end[-1]) != 0:
                    remaining_hours = n % self._get_business_hours_by_sec(self.start[0], self.end[-1])

                    for start_hour, end_hour in zip(self.start, self.end):
                        business_hours = self._get_business_hours_by_sec(start_hour, end_hour)

                        if remaining_hours <= business_hours:
                            corrected_time = start_hour + timedelta(seconds=remaining_hours)
                            break
                        else:
                            remaining_hours -= business_hours

                if corrected_time:
                    other = datetime(
                        other.year,
                        other.month,
                        other.day,
                        corrected_time.hour,
                        corrected_time.minute,
                        corrected_time.second,
                        corrected_time.microsecond
                    )
                    break

                if n > 0:
                    skip_days += 1
                    if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                        other = self._get_closing_time(other + timedelta(days=skip_days))
                else:
                    skip_days -= 1
                    if other.time() in self.start:
                        other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

                    if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other - timedelta(days=skip_days)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This revised `apply` method handles the calculation of business hours, adjusting the DateTime object based on holidays and CustomBusinessHour frequency, and ensures accurate skipping of business days.

By incorporating these corrections, the bug related to the discrepancy in periods when holidays are included in the CustomBusinessHour frequency should be resolved.
