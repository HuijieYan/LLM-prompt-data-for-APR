### Analysis:
1. The buggy code involves a CustomBusinessHour class with a method `apply` that calculates business hours based on given parameters.
2. The GitHub issue highlights a problem when using `date_range` with periods and holidays, which leads to unexpected results.
3. The issue seems to be related to incorrect handling of holidays and consequent miscalculation of business hours.
   
### Bug Cause:
1. The bug occurs due to improper handling of holidays within the `apply` method, leading to incorrect adjustment of business hours.
2. When adjusting for holidays, the code does not correctly consider the impact of skipped business hours, resulting in extra periods in the output.
   
### Strategy for Fixing:
1. Modify the logic for adjusting business hours to properly account for skipped hours during holidays.
2. Update the code within the `apply` method to correctly handle holidays and ensure the adjustment of business hours is accurate.
   
### Corrected Version:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour

class CustomBusinessHourWithHolidays(CustomBusinessHour):
    
    def __init__(self, start='09:00', end='17:00', holidays=None):
        super().__init__(start=start, end=end)
        self.holidays = holidays if holidays else []
    
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # original code logic
            
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            normalized_dt = other.replace(minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
            n = self.n
            
            # check if other is on offset
            if n >= 0:
                if normalized_dt.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(normalized_dt):
                    normalized_dt = self._next_opening_time(normalized_dt)
            else:
                if normalized_dt.time() in self.start:
                    normalized_dt = normalized_dt - timedelta(hours=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(normalized_dt):
                    normalized_dt = self._next_opening_time(normalized_dt)
                    normalized_dt = self._get_closing_time(normalized_dt)
            
            # consider holidays for making adjustments
            while normalized_dt in self.holidays:
                normalized_dt = self._next_opening_time(normalized_dt)
                normalized_dt = self._get_closing_time(normalized_dt)
            
            return normalized_dt
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the business hour application logic to consider holidays and skip the corresponding periods, the corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to unexpected results when using `date_range` with periods and holidays.
