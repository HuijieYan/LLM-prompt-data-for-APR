### Analysis:
The buggy function is `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class of `pandas.tseries.offsets.py`. The issue reported on GitHub involves using periods in `pd.date_range` with `CustomBusinessHour`, showing unexpected behavior when holidays are added.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of holidays within the `apply` function.
2. Calculation or logic errors related to adjusting dates based on business hours.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of holidays in the `apply` function. When holidays are added, the function fails to adjust the dates properly, causing the unexpected behavior seen in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that holidays are correctly integrated into the logic of adjusting dates within the business hours.
2. Verify that the calculation for adjusting dates based on business hours is accurate and does not lead to overshooting or skipping periods.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # original code here
    
        # replace the erroneous logic involving holidays
        for holiday in self.holidays:
            if other.date() == holiday.date():
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                        other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        # remaining code here unchanged
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, holidays are properly checked within the loop to ensure that they are accounted for during the adjustment of dates within the business hours. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
