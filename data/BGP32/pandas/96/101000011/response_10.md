### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is related to custom business hours in Pandas, specifically to adjust date and time values based on business hours. The GitHub issue indicates that there is a problem when using the function with custom business hours and holidays. The output provided in the GitHub issue shows that the number of periods generated exceeds the expected count due to the inclusion of holidays.

### Identified Issue:
The bug seems to stem from how the `apply` function handles the adjustment of time values, particularly when encountering holidays and weekends. The issue seems to be related to the calculation of business hours and the adjustment logic for handling holidays.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. The function does not adequately account for holidays when adjusting the datetime values based on business hours.
2. Incorrect handling of business days and holidays results in an incorrect number of periods generated in scenarios that involve holidays.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `apply` function needs to be modified to correctly consider holidays and adjust the datetime values accordingly based on the given custom business hours. Adjusting the logic for handling holidays and weekends is crucial to ensure the correct number of periods is generated.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            curr_day = other.date()

            # Check if the current day is a holiday or weekend
            if curr_day in self.holidays or curr_day.weekday() >= 5:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            # Adjust date and time based on business hours
            while n != 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

                if other.time() in self.start:
                    n -= 1

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By updating the `apply` function with the corrected logic to handle holidays and weekends appropriately, the bug should be fixed, and the number of periods generated should align with expectations.
