### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` inside the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `offsets.py` file of Pandas is causing issues when combining business hours with datetime objects. This problem is leading to unexpected outcomes in scenarios involving periods and holidays within the `date_range` function of Pandas. The bug is directly affecting the functionality when periods and holidays are specified, generating more periods than expected.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The adjustment of business days using `BusinessDay` is not working consistently.
2. The handling of business hour adjustments within time intervals could be causing discrepancies.
3. Using uneven increments for adjusting business days or hours could lead to incorrect results.

### Cause of Bug:
The bug appears to stem from how the `apply` function combines business hours with datetime objects. In specific cases where periods and holidays are involved, the adjustments made by the function lead to unexpected behavior. It seems that the issue lies in the logic for adjusting time intervals and moving across business days. Incorrect calculations within these sections of the function could cause the mismatch in the number of periods generated.

### Strategy for Fix:
1. Ensure consistent handling of business day adjustments.
2. Verify the accuracy of adjustments within business hours when moving between time intervals.
3. Use appropriate increments while adjusting business days and hours to maintain the expected results.

### Corrected Version:

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(hours=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            other += np.busdayoffset(n=bd, roll='forward')
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        total = businesshours if n >= 0 else -businesshours

        while r != 0:
            offset = np.busdayoffset(n=total, roll='forward')
            if np.fabs(offset - other) * 60 > r:
                other = offset
                break
            r -= np.fabs(offset - other) * 60
            other = offset

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Changes Made:
1. Adjusted the business day handling logic to use `np.busdayoffset` for consistent results.
2. Improved the adjustment loop to correctly calculate remaining business hours within each interval.
3. Ensured the adjustments are applied using appropriate increments and methods to maintain accuracy.

By applying these corrections, the function should now accurately combine business hours with datetime objects, resolving the issue reported on GitHub related to unexpected periods generation in `date_range` with holidays.
