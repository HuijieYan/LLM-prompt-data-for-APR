### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is responsible for adjusting the datetime object based on business hours specified. The issue described on GitHub relates to the behavior of `pd.date_range` when using periods and adding holidays. The provided example demonstrates that adding holidays causes the number of periods to be miscalculated.

### Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to stem from the inaccurate adjustment of business hours when holidays are considered. The logic within the `apply` function to handle business hours with positive and negative values might be causing the problem.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of holidays within the business hour adjustment logic. The adjustment of the datetime object might not be accounting for holidays properly, leading to an erroneous calculation of business periods and intervals.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when holidays are present, the adjustment of business hours correctly considers skipping those holidays. This adjustment should align the business periods with business days excluding the holidays.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            original_other = other
            start_dt = other
            if isinstance(other, date):
                other = datetime.combine(other, datetime.min.time())

            start_date = other + timedelta(hours=1)
            while True:
                next_tick = other + timedelta(hours=1)
                next_tick = self._next_opening_time(next_tick)
                if next_tick <= other:
                    # Check if we have crossed a business day boundary
                    next_tick += timedelta(hours=1)
                    if self._is_on_offset(next_tick):
                        businesshours = self._get_business_hours_by_sec(next_tick, next_tick)
                        other = next_tick
                    else:
                        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
                    continue

                closing_time = self._get_closing_time(other)
                if next_tick >= closing_time:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(closing_time)
                else:
                    other = next_tick

                if original_other < other:
                    break

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version aims to address the issue of handling holidays and adjusting business hours correctly within the `apply` function. By making adjustments based on business day boundaries and considering holidays, the function should now behave as expected when used with `pd.date_range`.
