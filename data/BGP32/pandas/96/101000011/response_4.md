### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is responsible for the incorrect behavior observed in the GitHub issue related to `pd.date_range`. The issue arises when using periods and adding holidays together, causing more periods than intended.

### Identified Issue:
The bug seems to be related to how the `apply` function handles adjustments for holidays and shifts in business hours. The problematic part seems to be in the while loops where adjustments are made based on remaining business hours (`bhour_remain`). This causes incorrect calculations and leads to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, you should adjust the logic within the while loops that handle remaining business hours. Ensure that the adjustments for holidays and shifts are calculated correctly to align with the expected behavior of the custom business hour frequency.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` function:
Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            for holiday in self.holidays:
                if other.date() == holiday:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    
            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            remaining_hours = abs(n) * businesshours // 60
            remaining_hours = -remaining_hours if n < 0 else remaining_hours
            
            div, mod = divmod(remaining_hours, businesshours // 60)
            
            # adjust by business days first
            if div != 0:
                business_days_shift = BusinessDay(n=div)
                other += business_days_shift
            
            # remaining business hours to adjust
            remaining_minutes = mod
            while remaining_minutes != 0:
                current_hour = other.hour
                if n >= 0:
                    if current_hour in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    if current_hour in self.start:
                        other = other - timedelta(hours=1)
                    if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                        other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                
                hour_remain = self._get_business_hours_by_sec(self.start[current_hour], self.end[current_hour]) // 3600
                if remaining_minutes >= hour_remain:
                    remaining_minutes -= hour_remain
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    other += timedelta(minutes=remaining_minutes)
                    remaining_minutes = 0

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By fixing the logic for adjusting remaining business hours, the corrected function should now properly handle the adjustments needed for holidays and shifts in business hours, as observed in the GitHub issue related to the unexpected behavior of `pd.date_range` with periods and holidays.
