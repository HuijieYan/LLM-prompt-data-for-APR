### Analysis:
The buggy function causing an issue in the `pd.date_range` function, specifically when using periods and adding holidays. The buggy function in `CustomBusinessHour` is responsible for calculating the next business hour based on the specified parameters. The issue seems to be related to the calculation logic within the `apply` method of the `CustomBusinessHour` class. 

### Identifying Potential Errors:
1. The logic for adjusting the business hours and handling holidays may not be correctly implemented.
2. The calculation of `n` and adjustment of dates based on positive and negative values of `n` might be leading to unexpected results.
3. The handling of `bd` (business days) and remaining business hours (`bhour_remain`) might have issues when dealing with holidays.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be related to how the `apply` method in the `CustomBusinessHour` class adjusts the given datetime based on business hours, business days, and potentially holidays. Incorrect adjustments and calculations within this method are leading to unexpected output when using the `pd.date_range` function with periods and holidays.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Review and correct the logic for adjusting the given datetime based on the business hours and days, ensuring that it handles positive and negative values of `n` accurately.
2. Verify the handling of holidays, ensuring that the adjustment accounts for holidays correctly and does not skip or repeat time intervals.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` Method:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            business_day = BusinessDay()
            offset = 0
            if isinstance(self.n, int):
                offset = self.n * 60
            else:
                raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with integer minutes")

            current_date = other.replace(second=0, microsecond=0)

            total_business_hours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) // 60
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            business_days, remaining_minutes = divmod(abs(offset), total_business_hours)

            if offset < 0:
                business_days = -business_days
                remaining_minutes = -remaining_minutes

            if business_days != 0:
                current_date = business_day.apply(current_date, business_days)

            current_time = current_date.time()

            if offset >= 0:
                while remaining_minutes > 0:
                    closing_time = self._get_closing_time(current_date)
                    next_opening_time = self._next_opening_time(current_date)
                    business_hour = (closing_time - current_date).seconds // 60

                    if remaining_minutes >= business_hour:
                        current_date = next_opening_time
                        remaining_minutes -= business_hour
                    else:
                        current_date += timedelta(minutes=remaining_minutes)
                        break
            else:
                while remaining_minutes < 0:
                    opening_time = self._prev_opening_time(current_date)
                    next_opening_time = self._next_opening_time(current_date)
                    business_hour = (current_date - opening_time).seconds // 60

                    if remaining_minutes < -business_hour:
                        current_date = next_opening_time
                        remaining_minutes += business_hour
                    else:
                        current_date += timedelta(minutes=remaining_minutes)
                        break
            
            return current_date
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version aims to address the issues related to the incorrect adjustments and calculations within the `apply` method, providing a more robust and accurate implementation.
