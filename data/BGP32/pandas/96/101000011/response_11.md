### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is a method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The function is used as a custom business hour offset in pandas date_range, as seen in the GitHub issue description.
3. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when using periods in date_range with a custom business hour offset and adding holidays, the result is incorrect.
4. The buggy function `apply` is responsible for applying the custom business hour logic to the input datetime object.
5. The bug seems to stem from how the function handles adjustments based on business days and remaining business hours.
6. The incorrect handling of business days and remaining hours leads to the discrepancy in the number of periods generated, resulting in unexpected behavior in date_range.
  

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `apply` function is due to the incorrect adjustment of business days and remaining business hours for negative offsets. The logic for adjusting the datetime object based on these factors is flawed, leading to incorrect positioning of the datetime object within the business hours.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the adjustment logic for negative offsets needs to be refined to ensure that the datetime object is correctly adjusted within the business hours. Proper handling of subtracting business days and adjusting remaining hours is crucial for the correct functioning of the function.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        adjusted_time = other

        if n >= 0:
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                adjusted_time = self._next_opening_time(other)

        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                adjusted_time = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                adjusted_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
                adjusted_time = self._get_closing_time(adjusted_time)

        if n >= 0:
            while n != 0:
                if n > 0:
                    adjusted_time = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_time)
                    n -= 1
                else:
                    adjusted_time = self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_time)
                    n += 1
        else:
            while n != 0:
                if n < 0:
                    adjusted_time = self._get_closing_time(adjusted_time)
                    adjusted_time = self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_time)
                    n += 1

        return adjusted_time
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version refines the logic for adjusting the datetime object based on business days and remaining business hours for both positive and negative offsets, ensuring the correct positioning within the business hours. This should fix the issue reported on GitHub regarding the discrepancy in periods when using the custom business hour offset with date_range.
