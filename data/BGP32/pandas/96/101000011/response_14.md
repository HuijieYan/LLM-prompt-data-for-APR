### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class of the `offsets.py` file is responsible for adjusting datetime objects based on business hours and holidays. The bug causes the function to generate incorrect output for `pd.date_range` when adding holidays.

- The bug seems to stem from the incorrect logic related to handling holidays within the `apply` function.
- The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when holidays are added along with periods, the function generates more periods than expected.

### Bug Identification:
- The incorrect calculation in adjusting the datetime object when encountering holidays seems to be the root cause.
- The loop logic for adjusting business hours and the presence of holidays are likely contributing to the discrepancy in the number of periods generated.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function does not properly account for holidays while adjusting the datetime object based on business hours. This results in an incorrect number of periods generated when holidays are added, as observed in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug:
1. Ensure that holidays are correctly handled within the adjustment logic in the `apply` function.
2. Implement a proper mechanism to adjust business hours considering holidays to generate the correct number of periods.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # Corrected version of the buggy apply function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, tz=None, microsecond=0)
            n = self.n
            
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                else:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version of the `apply` function, the adjustments for business hours and holidays have been refined to ensure the correct number of periods are generated, as per the input configuration involving holidays. This version should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue related to the behavior of `pd.date_range` with periods and holidays.
