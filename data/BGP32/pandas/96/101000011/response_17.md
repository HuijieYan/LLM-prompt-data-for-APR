**Analysis:**
1. The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is used to adjust datetime values based on business hours, but it contains logic that results in unexpected behavior when combining with the `date_range` function.
2. The GitHub issue reports a problem where using `pd.date_range` with periods and holidays leads to incorrect output, producing more than the specified number of periods.
3. The buggy function likely contains errors in the logic for handling business hours adjustments, causing the discrepancy in the number of periods.
4. To fix the bug, the logic within the `apply` function needs to be reviewed and revised to ensure accurate adjustment of datetime values based on business hours without introducing unnecessary periods.

**Bug Fix Strategy:**
1. Address the logic related to adjusting datetime values based on business hours in the `apply` function.
2. Ensure that the adjustment process aligns with the intended behavior of combining business hours with datetime values without introducing additional periods.

**Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:**

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                while not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other = other + skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = (
                        self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    )
                    if bhour_remain < bhour or bhour_remain == bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(other)
                        )
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By revising the outdated code within the `apply` function, it should now correctly adjust datetime values based on business hours without the issue of producing additional periods when combined with the `date_range` function.
