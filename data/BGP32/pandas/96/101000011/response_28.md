### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is supposed to calculate the next business time based on the provided datetime input. However, in the context of the GitHub issue, the function is not handling holidays correctly when adjusting business hours, resulting in an incorrect number of periods in the output of `pd.date_range`.

### Identified Issue:
The issue seems to arise from the way the function handles adjustments for holidays. When a holiday is encountered, the function fails to properly adjust the datetime to skip over the holiday and calculate the correct number of business hours. This leads to discrepancies in the number of periods and unexpected behavior in `pd.date_range`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and ensure correct handling of holidays, we need to enhance the logic within the `apply` function to properly skip holidays and adjust the business hours accordingly. This involves correctly identifying holidays within the function and adjusting the datetime calculations accordingly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BaseOffset

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            if hasattr(self, 'holidays') and other in self.holidays:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                
            n = self.n
            
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
            
            # Adjust for holidays by skipping business days
            if hasattr(self, 'holidays') and other in self.holidays:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
            
            # Adjust for business days
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = other + skip_bd
            
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                
                if (n >= 0 and bhour_remain >= bhour) or (n < 0 and (bhour_remain > bhour or bhour_remain == bhour)):
                    other += bhour
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))
            
            return other
        
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version includes enhancements to properly handle holidays by skipping them when adjusting for business hours. The adjustment logic within the function has been updated to correctly calculate the next business time, considering holidays and business days.
