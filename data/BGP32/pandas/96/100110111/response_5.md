### Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function is `apply` defined in the `CustomBusinessHour` class in the pandas library, particularly in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file. This function is responsible for applying the custom business hour offset to a given datetime object. The function calculates the adjusted datetime based on the business hours and days provided in the custom business hour offset.

### Identifying potential error locations

1. Adjusting the `other` datetime object to reset the timezone and nanosecond could lead to incorrect results.
2. The calculation of business hours might not be accurate.
3. The adjustments for business days and remaining business hours may not be correct.

### Explanation of the bug

The bug in the function `apply` is causing incorrect adjustments when a custom business hour with holidays is used in a date range generation. The specific scenario in the failing test is when creating a date range with `freq=pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour(start='15:00', holidays=['2020-11-26'])`.

In this scenario, the business hours are calculated wrongly, leading to unexpected output datetime values. The error is caused by incorrect adjustments for holidays and handling business hour intervals.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

1. Ensure accurate adjustments for holidays and business hours.
2. Check the correctness of date and time calculation logic, especially when considering holidays in the custom business hour offset.
3. Validate the logic for business days to handle edge cases appropriately.

### Bug-fixed version of the function

Below is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):        
        n = self.n
        
        adjusted_other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond
        )
        
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() not in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                adjusted_other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                adjusted_other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                adjusted_other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                adjusted_other = self._get_closing_time(adjusted_other)
        
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                adjusted_other = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_other + timedelta(days=bd))
            else:
                adjusted_other += skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_other)) - adjusted_other
                if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                    adjusted_other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    adjusted_other = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_other) - adjusted_other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0):
                    adjusted_other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    adjusted_other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(adjusted_other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return adjusted_other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function should address the bug related to custom business hours with holidays in date range generation.
