### Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is meant to adjust a given timestamp according to a specific `CustomBusinessHour` offset. The failing test tries to create a date range using the `CustomBusinessHour` offset, including a holiday, which leads to incorrect results. The function encounters errors related to frequency validation and the resulting date range.

#### Error Locations
1. The adjustment in the function based on business days may not consider holidays correctly.
2. Calculations related to adjusting business hours and the number of business days may not be accurate.
3. Business time intervals may not be correctly handled for negative offsets.

### Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by inaccurate holiday handling and incorrect adjustment for holidays in the `apply` function. This leads to unexpected outcomes in the resulting date range, causing failures in the test case.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure proper handling of holidays when adjusting timestamps.
2. Accurately calculate business hours and business days for positive and negative offsets.
3. Correctly handle business time intervals for both positive and negative adjustments.

### Bug-fixed Function
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        new_date = other
        if n >= 0:
            # Adjust for business days
            if CustomBusinessDay(holidays=self.holidays).is_on_offset(new_date):
                new_date += CustomBusinessDay(n=self.n, holidays=self.holidays)
            else:
                previous_opening_time = self._prev_opening_time(new_date)
                remain = new_date - previous_opening_time
                new_date = previous_opening_time + CustomBusinessDay(n=self.n, holidays=self.holidays) + remain
        else:
            if CustomBusinessDay(holidays=self.holidays).is_on_offset(new_date):
                previous_closing_time = self._get_closing_time(new_date)
                new_date -= CustomBusinessDay(n=1, holidays=self.holidays)
                if not self._is_on_offset(new_date):
                    new_date = self._next_opening_time(new_date)
                    new_date = self._get_closing_time(new_date)
            else:
                new_date = self._next_opening_time(new_date)
                new_date = self._get_closing_time(new_date)

        return new_date
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By fixing the bugs related to holiday handling, adjustments for positive and negative offsets, and business time intervals, the corrected function should now provide the expected results and satisfy the failing test case.
