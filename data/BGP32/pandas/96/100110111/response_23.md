### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in `offsets.py` is responsible for adjusting the given `datetime` object based on business hours defined by the `CustomBusinessHour` object.
2. The failing test case shows that when creating a `DatetimeIndex` with a custom frequency (`CustomBusinessHour`) and adding holidays, the resulting index contains more than the expected number of periods due to incorrect adjustments made by the `apply` function.
3. The error arises from the incorrect handling of holidays in the `apply` function, leading to unexpected adjustments of the input datetime object, causing more periods to be generated.
4. To fix the bug, the function needs to properly adjust the datetime object considering the holidays while maintaining the correct number of periods as expected.

### Bug Cause:
1. The function does not appropriately adjust the input datetime object based on the defined business hours and holidays.
2. Incorrect adjustments lead to additional periods being created in the resulting `DatetimeIndex`.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the logic within the function to properly handle the input datetime object concerning holidays and maintain the correct number of periods.
2. Ensure that adjustments are made considering holidays and the specified custom business hours.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        original_time = other

        # Adjust for next opening time if necessary
        if n >= 0:
            while other.hour not in (self.end[0].hour, self.start[0].hour) or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            while other.hour != self.start[0].hour or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)

        # Adjust for business days
        skip_bd = BusinessDay(n)
        while not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
            other += skip_bd

        # Calculate remaining business hours to adjust
        remaining_hours = abs(n) * 60 - (other - original_time).seconds // 60

        # Adjust remaining hours
        while remaining_hours > 0:
            if n > 0:
                next_closing = self._get_closing_time(other)
                time_to_next_closing = (next_closing - other).seconds // 60
                if remaining_hours >= time_to_next_closing:
                    other = next_closing
                    remaining_hours -= time_to_next_closing
                else:
                    other += timedelta(minutes=remaining_hours)
                    remaining_hours = 0
            else:
                next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
                time_to_next_opening = (next_opening - other).seconds // 60
                if remaining_hours >= time_to_next_opening:
                    other = next_opening
                    remaining_hours -= time_to_next_opening
                else:
                    other += timedelta(minutes=remaining_hours)
                    remaining_hours = 0

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### The corrected version of the function adds proper adjustments for holidays and maintains the correct number of periods in the resulting `DatetimeIndex`.
