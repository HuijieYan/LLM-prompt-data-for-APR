### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` is responsible for aligning the input parameter `other` with the custom business hours by adjusting to the closest business hours. The failing test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py` reveals that the function is not handling the adjustment correctly, resulting in unexpected frequencies and output values.

### Bug:
The bug arises from incorrect handling of adjustment to the closest business hours when holidays are involved. This causes the frequencies to be miscalculated, resulting in outputs that do not match the expected results.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the function's logic to properly consider holidays when adjusting the input parameter `other` to the nearest business hours.
2. Ensure that the adjustments for positive and negative `n` values correctly handle the movement to the next or previous business day when necessary.
3. Validate the frequency and alignment in accordance with the expected behavior when working with custom business hours.

### Code Fix:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        
        # Get the current date and time components for adjustment
        other_date = date(other.year, other.month, other.day)
        other_time = other.time()
        
        # Set the timezone and reset nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # Adjust 'other' to align with the business hours
        if n >= 0:
            if other_time in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other_time in self.start:
                # Adjustment to move to the previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(days=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Calculate total business hours in one business day
        business_hours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        # Calculate the number of business days and remaining business hours
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                # Move to the next business day
                other = self.next_bday.apply(other)
            other = other + skip_bd

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if (
                    bhour_remain > bhour
                    or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0)
                ):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By updating the logic to correctly align with custom business hours while considering holidays, the bug can be fixed. This corrected version of the `apply` function should now pass the failing test and align with the expected input/output values.
