### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is identified to have issues related to business hour adjustment.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` from `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py` demonstrates the failure of the `pd.date_range` function when adding holidays to a custom business hour offset.
3. The error message indicates that the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency, leading to a `ValueError`. This issue causes the date range to have more periods than expected when holidays are included.
4. A possible strategy for fixing the bug is to implement proper handling of holidays within the `apply` function to adjust the date correctly.
5. The corrected version of the `apply` function is provided below.

### Bug fix for the `apply` function:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        
        skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
        
        if bd != 0:
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other) and other.time() < self.start[0]:
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() < 0:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying this fix, the `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` should pass without errors.
