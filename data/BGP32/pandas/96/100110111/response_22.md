### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is related to custom business hour handling in Pandas.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is checking the behavior with custom business hours and holidays.
3. The error message suggests a mismatch between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency, leading to a `ValueError`.
4. The bug causes unexpected behavior, including generating more peridos than expected.
5. The issue on GitHub highlights the problem with `date_range` when adding holidays along with periods, causing more periods than specified.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Debug and correct the holiday handling logic within the `apply` function.
2. Ensure that adjustments for holidays do not result in incorrect period counts.
3. Improve the logic related to setting up custom business hours and handling holidays to align with the expected behavior.
