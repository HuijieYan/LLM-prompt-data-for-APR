### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is designed to adjust a given datetime object based on a business hour offset.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` aims to test the functionality of creating a date range with custom business hours, including holidays.
3. The provided error message indicates a value error caused during frequency validation, which leads to unexpected results in the generated date range.
4. The expected input/output values focus on adjusting the given datetime object within the specified business hour offset correctly.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `apply` function causes an issue when adjusting the datetime object within the specified business hours, especially when holidays are involved. This leads to unexpected results in generating the date range, as seen in the failing test.

The key issue arises from the incorrect adjustment logic in the `apply` function, where the holiday is not handled correctly, leading to an incorrect date range output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the adjustment logic within the `apply` function needs to be updated to properly handle holidays and ensure that the datetime object is adjusted within the correct business hour offset. By refining the adjustment process, the function should be able to generate the expected output for the provided test.

### Updated Function:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if self.holidays is None or other.date() not in self.holidays:
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making the adjustments in the function as outlined above, the issue with the incorrect adjustment based on holidays should be resolved, and the function should be able to generate the expected output for the provided test case.
