### Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is responsible for adjusting datetime values based on business hour offsets. The error message indicates a mismatch between the inferred frequency of the index and the passed frequency, leading to a `ValueError`. This discrepancy is likely due to incorrect adjustments made by the `apply` function.

### Bug Identification
The bug in the function `apply` seems to arise from the calculations involving dates and times, particularly related to adjusting for business days and remaining business hours. The issue could be within the logic for handling positive or negative offsets and the adjustments made to the input datetime.

### Bug Explanation
The failing test case with custom holidays triggers the error because the `apply` function does not correctly adjust for holidays, leading to incorrect frequency handling. The mismatch in frequencies causes the `ValueError` during validation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that the adjustment process considers holidays properly.
2. Verify the logic for positive and negative offsets in adjusting business days and business hours.
3. Check the calculations for remaining business hours to ensure correct adjustments.

### Bug-fixed Function
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)

        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
            if bhour_remain > bhour:
                other += bhour
                bhour_remain -= bhour
            else:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

        return other

    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the logic for handling business days, holidays, and remaining business hours, this corrected version aims to address the bug in the original function and pass the failing test case.
