### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is designed to handle business hours offsets with datetime inputs, adjusting the datetime according to the specified offset.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` tries to create a date range using custom business hours where the final output deviates from the expected result due to the implementation issue in the `apply` function.
3. The main cause of the bug seems to be the incorrect adjustment of the datetime when different business offsets need to be considered, leading to the unexpected datetime values in the output.
4. The error message points to a verification failure related to the frequency validation process.
5. To fix the bug, the adjustment logic in the `apply` function needs to be revised to ensure that the datetime is correctly aligned with the specified business offsets.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the adjustment procedure in the `apply` function to correctly account for positive and negative business hour offsets.
2. Ensure that the adjustments handle edge cases like holidays and weekends appropriately to align the datetime with the expected business hours.
3. Refactor the code to improve readability and maintainability.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if isinstance(other, date):
            other = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day)
        n = self.n

        skip_holidays = pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour(holidays=self.holidays)
        
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            other = other.normalize()
            for _ in range(abs(bd)):
                other = other + (skip_holidays if n > 0 else -skip_holidays)

        if r != 0:
            business_sec = self._get_business_hours_by_sec(other.time(), self._get_closing_time(other))
            total_sec = 60 * r
            remaining_sec = total_sec
            while remaining_sec > 0:
                shift = min(remaining_sec, business_sec)
                other = other + timedelta(seconds=shift)
                remaining_sec -= shift
                if remaining_sec > 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        return other

    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Changes Made:
1. Refactored the adjustment logic to handle both positive and negative business hour offsets correctly.
2. Introduced `skip_holidays` offset to account for holidays while adjusting the datetime.
3. Fixed the business days and remaining business hours adjustments based on the offset value.
4. Adjusted the code to align the datetime with the specified custom business hours.
5. Improved variable naming for better readability and understanding.

By implementing these changes, the corrected version of the `apply` function should address the bug and align the datetime values with the expected business hours in the date range creation scenario.
