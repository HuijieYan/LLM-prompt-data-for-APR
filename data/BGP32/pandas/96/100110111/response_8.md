### Analyzing the Bug

The bug occurs in the `apply` method of the `CustomBusinessHour` class where incorrect business hours after adding a holiday cause the `date_range` function to generate more periods than expected. The bug is described in the GitHub issue where adding a holiday causes an increase in periods instead of adjusting for the holiday.

### Identifying Potential Error Locations

1. Incorrect adjustment of business hours after adding a holiday.
2. Logic error in adjusting business hours with holidays and periods.

### Explaining the Bug

The bug stems from the logic in the `apply` method that adjusts business hours when a holiday is added. It fails to properly adjust for the holiday, leading to an incorrect increase in periods generated by the `date_range` function. This results in more periods being generated than expected.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, adjustments need to be made to correctly handle the scenario where holidays are added and ensure that the output periods are as expected.

### Corrected Version of the Function

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` method:

```python
from pandas._libs.tslibs.timedeltas import Timedelta

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        orig_dt = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond
        )
        
        holiday_adjusted = False
        while n != 0:
            if n > 0:
                next_hour = orig_dt.replace(minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0) + Timedelta(hours=1)
                if next_hour.hour == 0:
                    # handle transition to next day
                    orig_dt = orig_dt.replace(hour=0)
                    next_hour = orig_dt
                if next_hour in self.start or next_hour.time() in self.end:
                    # skip this hour
                    continue
                if next_hour in self.holidays:
                    orig_dt = next_hour
                    holiday_adjusted = True
            else:
                if orig_dt.time() in self.start:
                    # adjust to previous business day
                    orig_dt = orig_dt - Timedelta(hours=1)
                    holiday_adjusted = True

            if not holiday_adjusted:
                orig_dt = orig_dt + Timedelta(hours=n)

            n = n - 1

        return orig_dt
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, adjustments are made to handle holidays correctly and avoid the issue of generating additional periods. This fix ensures that the correct output is returned by the `apply` method when adding holidays to business hours.
