### Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is not handling the holiday properly, leading to incorrect behavior when generating the date range with custom business hours that include holidays. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` demonstrates this issue when using `pd.date_range` with a frequency of `CustomBusinessHour` and including a holiday.

The expected behavior is to correctly apply the custom business hours, including holidays, when generating the date range. The bug seems to be related to how the function adjusts the dates based on holidays and business hours.

### Bug Identification
The bug likely occurs in the holiday adjustment part of the `apply` function. It doesn't handle the holidays correctly, which results in incorrect date generation when using `CustomBusinessHour` and including holidays.

### Bug Explanation
The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` uses a custom business hour with a holiday on November 26, 2020. The expected behavior is to skip the holiday date while generating the date range, ensuring that the output aligns with business hours.

However, the buggy `apply` function does not properly handle holidays when adjusting the dates based on the business hours. This leads to dates being incorrectly generated, including the holiday date in the output.

The failing test indicates a mismatch between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency, as the generated date range does not conform to the expected business hours when including holidays.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `apply` function should be updated to correctly adjust the dates when holidays are present. Ensure that holidays are skipped when generating the date range based on custom business hours.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(self.n * 60), businesshours // 60)

        if self.n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        other = self.apply_range(other, bd, r)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

def apply_range(self, other, bd, r):
    # Helper function to apply the date range adjustments

    if bd != 0:
        skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
        if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
            prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            remain = other - prev_open
            other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
        else:
            other = other + skip_bd

    bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

    while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
        if self.n >= 0:
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
            if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

    return other
```

This corrected version ensures that when adjusting dates based on business hours and holidays, the dates are correctly aligned with business hours and avoid the holiday dates.

Running the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` against this corrected version should result in the test passing successfully.
