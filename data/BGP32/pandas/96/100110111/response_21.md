## Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is designed to handle adjustments related to business hours. The error message from the failing test indicates a problem with the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency when generating date ranges with periods and holidays.

The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` specifically creates a `CustomBusinessHour` frequency with a start time, holidays, and a range of periods. The expected output is a DatetimeIndex with specific timestamps, but the buggy behavior causes incorrect timestamps that extend beyond the expected range due to holidays.

The root cause of the bug seems to lie within the logic of adjusting business hours and handling holidays in the `apply` function. The unexpected offset of periods may result from improper holiday handling within the adjustment process, leading to an incorrect DatetimeIndex generation.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the holiday handling and adjustment logic within the `apply` method must be modified to ensure correct period calculation while accounting for the specified holidays in the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency.

One key aspect of the fix involves considering holidays in the adjustment process, such as aligning the expected periods correctly and excluded holidays from the period count. Ensuring that the adjustment process respects holidays will prevent the unexpected extension of periods beyond the specified range.

## Bug Fix

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n < 0:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Negative n values are not supported in CustomBusinessHour")

        timestamp = other

        def is_on_period(dt):
            return any(
                start <= dt.time() < end for start, end in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

        while n > 0:
            timestamp = self._next_opening_time(timestamp)
            while not is_on_period(timestamp):
                timestamp = self._next_opening_time(timestamp)

            n -= 1

        while n < 0:
            timestamp = self._prev_opening_time(timestamp)
            while not is_on_period(timestamp):
                timestamp = self._prev_opening_time(timestamp)

            n += 1

        return timestamp
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, we have adjusted the iteration through periods while accounting for holidays to ensure that the date range creation correctly considers the specified number of periods.

This fix aims to resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug regarding unexpected behavior when using periods and holidays with a CustomBusinessHour frequency in generating date ranges.
