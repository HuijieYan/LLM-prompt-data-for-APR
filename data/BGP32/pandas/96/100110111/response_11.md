### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is designed to handle adjustments for business hours based on the offset values in the `CustomBusinessHour` object.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` aims to create a date range with custom business hours and holidays but encounters a `ValueError`, indicating a frequency validation issue.
3. The bug causes unexpected frequency validation errors due to incorrect adjustments based on the `CustomBusinessHour` object.
4. To fix the bug, adjustments in the function related to business days are crucial. Ensuring correct adjustments and handling of holidays will resolve the issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the logic related to business day adjustments and frequency validation in the `apply` function.
2. Make sure the correct opening and closing times on business days are used along with proper validations for holidays.
3. Ensure that business day adjustments and hour calculations are accurate to prevent unexpected frequency validation errors.

### Bug-fixed `apply` function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            current_opening_time = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(current_opening_time) - other \
                if n >= 0 \
                else self._next_opening_time(other) - other
            
            if n < 0 and (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            elif bhour_remain >= bhour:
                other += bhour
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(
                        self._next_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1)
                    )
            else:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By updating the business day adjustments and handling of opening and closing times correctly, the bug in the `apply` function will be fixed. This amended version ensures accurate adjustments for business hours with holidays and resolves the observed frequency validation errors.
