## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `apply` from the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is encountering an issue where, when given a `CustomBusinessHour` frequency with holidays, it generates more periods than expected in certain cases. This issue was reported on GitHub, and the failing test case provided indicates an unexpected behavior when adding holidays to the date range with periods.

### Identified Error Location
The bug seems to be related to how the function handles business days and the adjustment of business hours when the frequency is a custom business hour with holidays.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug arises due to how the function performs adjustments based on the custom business hour frequency with holidays. Incorrect calculations are leading to more periods being generated than expected, causing the `date_range` to output an unexpected number of dates.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that the holiday handling logic within the function is correct and aligns with the expected behavior when adjusting dates.
2. Review the business days and business hours calculations to identify any errors that might cause an incorrect number of periods to be generated.

## Bug-fixed Function
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            dt = CustomBusinessHour(start='00:00').apply(other)
            close = self._next_opening_time(dt)
            cnt = (close - other).seconds // 3600

            if close.date() in self.holidays:
                cnt += 1

            final = CustomBusinessHour(start=self.start[0].isoformat(), finish=self.end[0].isoformat()).apply(other) + timedelta(hours=cnt)
            return final

        elif n < 0:
            dt = CustomBusinessHour(start='00:00').apply(other)
            prev = CustomBusinessHour(start=self.start[0].isoformat(), finish=self.end[0].isoformat()).apply(dt) + timedelta(hours=-1)
            cnt = (other - prev).seconds // 3600

            if prev.date() in self.holidays:
                cnt += 1

            final = CustomBusinessHour(start=self.start[0].isoformat(), finish=self.end[0].isoformat()).apply(dt) - timedelta(hours=cnt)
            return final

    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version ensures that the adjustments for business days and business hours are correctly calculated, considering the holidays. It should address the issue mentioned in the failing test case and the GitHub report.

Please test this updated function with the provided failing test case to confirm that the bug is resolved.
