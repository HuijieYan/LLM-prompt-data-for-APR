The buggy function `apply` in `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` is causing unexpected behavior when using custom business hours with holidays in the `pd.date_range` function, leading to the failing test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py`. The error message indicates that the frequencies of the generated dates are not conforming to the expected frequencies.

### Bug Explanation:
The `apply` function for custom business hours does not correctly handle holidays, which causes additional periods to be generated when holidays are included. The calculation of adjusting business days and hours does not consider holidays, leading to incorrect date generation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the logic to account for holidays when calculating business days and hours to ensure the generated dates are correct.
2. Make sure that the adjustment during holiday periods does not introduce additional unexpected periods.

### Updated `apply` Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        original_day = other.day

        # Adjust based on holidays
        for _ in range(abs(n)):
            while True:
                other += timedelta(days=1 if n > 0 else -1)
                if other.weekday() not in self.weekmask or other in self.holidays:
                    continue
                n -= 1 if n > 0 else -1

        offset = CustomBusinessHour(*self.start, weekmask=self.weekmask, holidays=self.holidays)
        result = offset.apply(other)

        if original_day != result.day:
            result = result.replace(day=original_day)
        return result
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This updated version of the `apply` function should address the issue and ensure that the `pd.date_range` function works correctly when using custom business hours with holidays.

After applying this fix, the `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` test case should pass without any errors.
