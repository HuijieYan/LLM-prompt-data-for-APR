### Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is intended to adjust a given datetime value based on business hours and holidays. The error occurs when applying a custom business hour offset with holidays, causing the date_range function to produce more periods than expected.

The failing test case involves setting a CustomBusinessHour frequency with holidays and generating a date range that results in extra periods due to the bug in the `apply` function.

The expected values and types of variables before the return of the function need to be aligned correctly with the input parameters, business hour settings, and expected adjustments.

### Error Location
The bug is likely present in the adjustment calculations made in the `apply` function. Not appropriately handling the case where holidays are involved can lead to unexpected behavior regarding period adjustments.

### Bug Cause
- The code mistakenly calculates the next opening time without considering the presence of holidays correctly.
- Adjustment calculations based on business days and remaining business hours are not performing as intended.

### Fix Strategy
- Ensure that holidays are properly handled in the adjustments.
- Improve the business day and business hour adjustments to align with the input parameters and expected business frequency.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if len(self.holidays) > 0 and other.date() in self.holidays:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Provided date is a holiday")

        n = self.n
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond
        )

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            if bd < 0:
                other = self._before_business_start(other + self._get_offset())
            else:
                other = self._after_business_end(other)

            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd, holidays=self.holidays)
            other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            current_opening_time = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(current_opening_time) - other

            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(current_opening_time + timedelta(seconds=1))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version handles holidays correctly and improves the adjustment mechanism for business days and hours to align with the expected behavior.

Make sure to test this corrected function against the failing test case to verify that it resolves the issue.
