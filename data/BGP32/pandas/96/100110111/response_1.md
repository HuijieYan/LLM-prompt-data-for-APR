### Issue Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is not handling the case correctly when custom holidays are provided in the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency. This results in incorrect date calculations, leading to failing tests.

The failing test is related to custom business hours with a holiday on November 26, 2020. The expected output is a date range starting at 2020-11-25 15:00 with 4 periods, but due to the buggy function, the output is incorrect.

The failing test is not validating the expected date range correctly, leading to a ValueError in the Pandas library, specifically in the frequency validation function.

### Bug Cause
The main cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of the case when custom holidays are provided. The function `apply` should adjust for holidays to generate the correct date range, but it fails to do so in the buggy version.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the `apply` function should correctly handle custom holidays when calculating the date ranges. By adjusting the offset based on holidays, the function can generate the expected output without any errors.

### Provided Fix
After analyzing the bug and considering the expected input/output values, I have corrected the `apply` function to properly handle custom holidays as per the provided test case.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if self.holidays and other.date() in self.holidays:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = (
                    self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                )
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    # go to next business time interval
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour:
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    # go to next business time interval
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(
                        self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))
                    )

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Please replace the buggy `apply` function with the corrected version provided above. The corrected function should now handle custom holidays correctly and pass the failing test without any errors.
