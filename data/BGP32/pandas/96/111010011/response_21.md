### Analysis:
1. The bug occurs in the `apply` function inside the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The error message indicates a `ValueError` that occurs during the validation of a frequency when using `pd.date_range`.
3. The GitHub issue provided demonstrates a similar behavior where adding holidays leads to more periods being generated than specified.
4. The issue seems to stem from incorrect handling of holidays, leading to an incorrect number of periods being generated.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy code does not properly handle the case when holidays are involved, leading to an incorrect number of periods generated in the `pd.date_range` function.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when applying custom business hours with holidays, the correct number of periods is generated without anomalies. This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other + skip_bd) + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other if n < 0 else self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                other += bhour
                if n < 0:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                bhour_remain -= bhour
            else:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version addresses the issue of incorrect periods being generated when holidays are included in the custom business hour frequency, ensuring a consistent and correct behavior.
