### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The issue reported on GitHub involves unexpected behavior in `pd.date_range` when using `periods` with a custom business hour frequency and holidays.
3. The error message is raised during frequency validation in `pd.date_range`.
4. The bug seems to stem from incorrect frequency validation which results in more periods being generated than expected.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the frequency validation is correct and matches the expected behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to incorrect frequency validation, specifically when determining whether the generated frequency matches the expected frequency. This leads to more periods being generated than requested in certain scenarios, hence causing the error.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the frequency validation check accurately compares the inferred frequency with the specified frequency to avoid any discrepancies.
2. Make sure that the generated frequency conforms to the user-defined criteria.
3. Correct any issues related to adjustments in the time intervals to align with the business hours.

### Solution:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if getattr(other, "date", None) is not None:  # Convert to datetime object if other is a Timestamp
            other = other.to_pydatetime()
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        while not self.is_on_offset(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This updated version ensures that the adjustments to the time intervals are correctly handled and aligned with the specified business hours, resolving the issue with generating incorrect periods in `pd.date_range` with custom business hours and holidays.
