### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is a method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class within the `pandas` library in the file `offsets.py`. It is used to adjust the given `datetime` object based on business hours.
2. The buggy function is utilizing various helper functions like `_next_opening_time`, `_get_business_hours_by_sec`, etc., to handle the adjustment logic.
3. The error message indicates a `ValueError` being raised during the validation process for a `CustomBusinessHour` frequency in a `pd.date_range` call. The issue on GitHub also mentions the same problem related to using periods and adding holidays.
4. The bug is likely due to incorrect adjustments being made in the `apply` method, leading to incorrect frequency validation in later steps.
5. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments and validations in the `apply` method are correctly handling the given `datetime` object and the business hours.

### Proposed Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` method:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
        
            final_time = None

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    final_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                    final_time = other
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    final_time = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            if final_time is None:
                final_time = other
            
            return final_time
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version focuses on correctly adjusting the `datetime` object `other` and returning the updated `final_time` based on business hours. Make sure to test this corrected version thoroughly to ensure it resolves the issue and passes the failing test case.
