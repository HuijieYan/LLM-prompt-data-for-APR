### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `apply` method within the `BusinessHourMixin` class, located in the offsets.py file of the pandas library.
2. The error message is related to a failure in the `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` test, which is checking the behavior of `pd.date_range` when using a custom business hour frequency with holidays.
3. The error message indicates a ValueError raised in the `_validate_frequency` method when checking the frequency compatibility between the DatetimeIndex and the specified frequency, `CBH` (CustomBusinessHour), with holidays. The issue stems from the incorrect conformance between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency.
4. To fix the bug, the `apply` method should be corrected to handle the adjustment of business days and business hours properly when incrementing or decrementing dates based on the specified business frequency. The adjustments made should align with the expected behavior when custom business hours and holidays are specified.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Check and adjust the logic within the `apply` method to address the error in the date calculations when dealing with custom business hours and holidays.
2. Ensure that the adjustments for business days and business hours properly align with the behavior expected for the given frequency.
3. Address the identified issues within the date adjustments to correct the conformance between the inferred and specified frequencies.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` method:
```python
# This corrected version addresses the issues causing the ValueError during frequency validation in date_range with custom holidays

from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            bhour = (
                self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            )
            if (n >= 0 and bhour_remain > bhour) or (n < 0 and bhour_remain < bhour):
                other += bhour_remain
                break
            other += bhour
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, adjustments are made for both business days and remaining business hours, updating the date calculations to align with the correct behavior when dealing with custom business hours and holiday scenarios.
