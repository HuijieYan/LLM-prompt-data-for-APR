### Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas` library. The function `apply` is responsible for adjusting a given datetime object based on business hours specified by the class instance. The issue arises when using `pd.date_range` with 'periods' argument along with `CustomBusinessHour` frequency and holidays, causing unexpected behavior.

### Potential error locations
1. Handling of business days adjustment.
2. Adjustment of remaining business hours.
3. Comparison conditions in while loops.

### Cause of the bug
The bug is likely related to the number of business days adjustment and the adjustment of remaining business hours. Due to incorrect handling, the function returns incorrect datetime values, causing `pd.date_range` to produce more periods than expected.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Ensure correct adjustment of business days before handling remaining hours.
2. Adjust remaining hours while correctly handling comparisons and adding/subtracting time increments.

### Corrected version of the function

Fixed `apply` function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            ...
            # existing code as is

            if bd != 0:
                for _ in range(abs(bd)):
                    if bd > 0:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + timedelta(days=1))
                    else:
                        other = other - timedelta(days=1)
                        while self._is_on_offset(other):
                            other = other - timedelta(days=1)

            if r != 0:
                while r != 0:
                    remaining_hours = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if abs(remaining_hours.total_seconds()) > r * 60:
                        other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                        r = 0
                    else:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other)))
                        r -= abs(remaining_hours.total_seconds() / 60)
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should address the issues in adjusting business days and remaining hours, ensuring the correct behavior when used with `pd.date_range` and holidays.
