### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` defined in the `BusinessHourMixin` class.
2. The function attempts to adjust a datetime object based on business hours specified by the class.
3. The error occurs due to an inconsistency in the inferred frequency when applying holidays.
4. The error message indicates that the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency.
5. The provided GitHub issue reports a similar problem where using periods and adding holidays results in unexpected datetime indexing behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of frequencies and holidays in the `apply` function. When holidays are introduced, the frequency inference does not match the passed frequency, leading to a `ValueError`.

### Fix Strategy:
To resolve the issue, adjust the handling of frequencies and how they interact with holidays in the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class.

### Updated Function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0 and other.time() in self.end:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            elif n < 0 and other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)

            # determine the delta between business hours
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
            _, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                r = -r

            # handle business days and remaining hours
            adjusted = self.apply_business_day_adjustment(other, n)
            adjusted = self.apply_remaining_hours_adjustment(adjusted, r, n)

            return adjusted
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Additional Functions:
```python
    def apply_business_day_adjustment(self, other, n):
        if abs(n) > 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=n)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd
        return other

    def apply_remaining_hours_adjustment(self, other, r, n):
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

            if bhour_remain < bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and getattr(other, 'nanosecond', 0) != 0):
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                if n < 0:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
                else:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

        return other
``` 

By incorporating the adjustments for business days and remaining hours within separate functions, the corrected version manages the frequency and holiday combination issue when applying business hour offsets.
