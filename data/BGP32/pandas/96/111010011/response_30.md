### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is raising an `ApplyTypeError` when the input is not of type `datetime`.
2. The function `apply` tries to adjust the input datetime based on the business hours' start and end time, as well as the number of business hours. The adjustment seems incorrect leading to extra periods being generated.
3. The error message indicates a `ValueError` is raised during frequency validation when using the `date_range` function with a custom business hour frequency and holidays.
4. The GitHub issue highlights a specific case where the `date_range` function behaves unexpectedly when using periods and adding holidays.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is occurring due to incorrect adjustment of the input datetime to match business hours' start and end times. This results in extra periods being generated incorrectly, leading to the mismatch in frequencies during validation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the adjustment of the input datetime should be corrected to ensure that the number of business hours is applied accurately within the specified range. Proper handling of edge cases such as start, end times, and holidays is crucial for the correct behavior of the function.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
            
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            
            total_mins = n * 60
            businessdays, remaining_mins = divmod(abs(total_mins), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                businessdays, remaining_mins = -businessdays, -remaining_mins
            
            if businessdays != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=businessdays)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
            
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=remaining_mins)
            
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other if total_mins < 0 else self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    other += min(bhour_remain, bhour)
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                else:
                    bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other) if total_mins < 0 else other - self._get_closing_time(other)
                    other -= min(abs(bhour_remain), abs(bhour))
                    bhour_remain += bhour
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By applying the corrected adjustments to the input datetime based on the business hours and number of business hours, the function should now behave correctly and pass the failing test cases, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
