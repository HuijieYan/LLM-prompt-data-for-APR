### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is inside the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the file `pandas/tseries/offsets.py`. It is decorated with `@apply_wraps`, indicating it should have certain behavior from the `apply_wraps` function, although the content of that function is not shown.
2. The error message mentions a `ValueError` being raised due to a frequency mismatch. The failing test related to custom business hours and holidays implies that the issue is arising when periods are used in `date_range` with `CustomBusinessHour` frequency and holidays provided. This aligns with the reported GitHub issue.
3. The bug lies in how the function adjusts timings in different scenarios, leading to unexpected behavior when holidays are present.
   
### Bug Cause:
1. The `apply` function is not handling the presence of holidays correctly when calculating business hours and adjusting timings.
2. When holidays are present, the function does not consider the skipped days due to holidays while calculating and adjusting the business hours which leads to a frequency mismatch error.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic in the `apply` function to correctly adjust for skipped hours due to holidays.
2. Ensure that when adjusting timing for periods, the function skips over holidays as required.

            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version adjusts for skipped days due to holidays when calculating business hours and adjusting timings, addressing the frequency mismatch error observed in the failing test and reported GitHub issue.
