### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `apply` method within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `offsets.py` file of Pandas library.
2. The error message indicates a ValueError being raised during validation of the frequency for the generated range of dates.
3. The bug causes the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency to behave unexpectedly when holidays are added, resulting in more periods than expected.
4. To fix this bug, we need to review the logic in the `apply` function that handles the adjustment of dates based on BusinessHours and holidays.
5. By correctly adjusting the dates based on BusinessDays and Business Hours, we can ensure that the `apply` function behaves as expected and passes the failing test.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(hours=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        while not self._is_on_offset(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This fixed version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency behaves correctly when holidays are involved.
