### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is causing the issue.
2. The error message indicates a `ValueError` is being raised due to frequency validation failure in the `_validate_frequency` method when creating a `DatetimeIndex` with a custom business hour frequency and holidays.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the problem with `pd.date_range` producing unexpected results when using periods and adding holidays.
4. The bug is due to the incorrect behavior in handling business hours and holidays while adjusting the datetime range.
   
### Fix Strategy:
1. Improve the logic for adjusting the datetime range while considering holidays and business hours.
2. Ensure correct frequency validation when generating the date range.
3. To fix the bug, adjust the logic to handle holidays properly within the business hour range calculation.
4. Update the `apply` function to fix the issue with the frequency and period calculation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessHour

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            business_hours = BusinessHour(
                start=self.start[0], 
                end=self.end[0],
                holidays=self.holidays
            )

            # adjust other based on business hours and holidays
            if n >= 0:
                other = business_hours.rollforward(other)
            else:
                other = business_hours.rollback(other)

            for _ in range(abs(n)):
                other = business_hours.rollforward(other if n >= 0 else other - timedelta(seconds=1))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By updating the `apply` function as shown above, ensuring proper handling of holidays within business hours, the issue reported in the GitHub thread should be resolved.
