### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is intended to work with business hours and adjust a given datetime object based on those business hours. However, the current implementation is causing issues related to datetime validation.
2. The error message indicates a `ValueError` being raised when trying to validate the frequency of DatetimeIndex with a frequency specified as `CustomBusinessHour`.
3. The error is linked to the `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py` test file, where the `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` function is failing due to the issue with date_range and CustomBusinessHour.
4. The GitHub issue reflects a problem with the usage of `pd.date_range` alongside CustomBusinessHour when adding holidays.
5. The bug seems to stem from the interaction between the `cls._validate_frequency` method, `index` values, and the `freq` provided, specifically for the CustomBusinessHour frequency.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `apply` function arises from the incompatible frequency validation between the `freq` passed as CustomBusinessHour in `pd.date_range` and the actual values in the index. This discrepancy leads to a `ValueError` due to non-matching frequencies.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the frequency validation is correctly processed and that the CustomBusinessHour is properly integrated into the frequency validation logic.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected and updated version of the `apply` function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.frequencies import to_offset

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if not issubclass(self.freq.__class__, to_offset):
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
        
        n = self.n
        other = other.replace(microsecond=0)
        
        while n != 0:
            other += self.freq
            if other.date() in self.holidays:
                continue
            n -= 1

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, we ensure that the frequency specified by CustomBusinessHour is correctly implemented into the adjustment loop based on the `n` factor. Additionally, we handle skipping holidays during the adjustment process to align with the desired business logic. This approach should resolve the frequency validation issue.
