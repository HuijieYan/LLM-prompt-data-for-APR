### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is attempting to adjust the given datetime `other` based on business hours specified by the class instance.
2. The error message indicates a ValueError raised during frequency validation in `pd.date_range`.
3. The GitHub issue reports unexpected behavior in `pd.date_range` when adding holidays while using periods with a custom business hour frequency.
4. The bug seems to stem from incorrect adjustment of datetime during business hours calculation, leading to unexpected results in `pd.date_range`.
5. The strategy for fixing the bug involves ensuring that the adjustments within the `apply` function align with the expected behavior for custom business hours.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function to address the bug:

```python
import numpy as np

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Adjust for business hours only if other is a datetime
            if self.is_on_offset(other):
                return other

            # Reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, nanosecond=0)

            adjusted_time = other
            direction = 1 if self.n >= 0 else -1

            while not self.is_on_offset(adjusted_time):
                adjusted_time = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_time, direction)
                
                if direction > 0 and adjusted_time.time() in self.start:
                    adjusted_time = self._get_closing_time(adjusted_time)
                    break
                
            return adjusted_time
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should address the bug related to unexpected behavior when using `pd.date_range` with custom business hours and holidays during periods.
