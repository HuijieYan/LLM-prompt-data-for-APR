### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class of the `offsets.py` file from the `pandas` library is causing an issue with `pd.date_range` when working with CustomBusinessHour frequency and holidays, leading to more periods than expected.
2. The bug is related to the mismatch between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency due to the application of holidays. This causes the `ValueError` to be raised during validation.
3. The cause of the bug lies in the handling of holidays within the logic of the `apply` function, leading to incorrect generation of periods in the frequency calculation.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `apply` function to correctly handle holidays when determining business hours and adjusting the datetime values.

### Approach to Fix:
1. Update the logic in the `apply` function to appropriately handle holidays and reduce the impact they have on the calculation of periods to align with the user's expectations.
2. Modify the adjustments made to the datetime values based on holidays and business hours to ensure the correct number of periods is generated.
3. Ensure that the inferred frequency matches the passed frequency after applying holidays to prevent the `ValueError` from being raised during validation.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` function:
```python
    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
    
            if bd != 0 and not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and other.nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Now, with the corrected logic in the `apply` function, the issue with generating more periods than expected when applying holidays to CustomBusinessHour frequency in the `pd.date_range` function should be resolved.
