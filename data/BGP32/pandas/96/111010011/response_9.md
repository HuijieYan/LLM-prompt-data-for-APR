### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the offsets.py file of pandas is causing an issue in the date_range function when defining custom business hours with holidays.
2. The error message states that the frequency validation fails due to a mismatch between the inferred frequency from passed values and the passed frequency.
3. This bug leads to the date_range generating more periods than expected when holidays are involved, causing incorrect output.
4. The GitHub issue confirms the problem where date_range fails with periods and holidays, resulting in extra periods.

### Bug Location:
The buggy section of the code is within the `apply` function where the adjustment calculations for business hours with holidays are causing the mismatch between inferred and passed frequencies.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by inconsistencies in handling business days and adjustment calculations, especially when dealing with holidays within the custom business hours. As a result, the date_range function does not function correctly with periods and holidays.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, modifications need to be made in the `apply` function specifically addressing the handling of holidays, adjustments with business days, and business hours calculations. Ensuring that the adjustments are correctly applied without introducing extra periods in the date_range function.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import ApplyTypeError

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if not isinstance(self, BusinessHourMixin):
            raise ApplyTypeError("Function only applicable to BusinessHourMixin")
        
        n = self.n
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0, nanosecond=0)

        while n != 0:
            if n > 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                n -= 1
            else:
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                n += 1
        
        if not self.is_on_offset(other):
            if n > 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Updated Change:
The correction involves simplifying the adjustment process for business hours without unnecessarily introducing extra periods. The adjustment loop is modified to ensure precise moves based on the business hour constraints, avoiding the issue of generating additional periods.

By applying this fix, the date_range function should now work correctly with periods and holidays without producing extra periods.
