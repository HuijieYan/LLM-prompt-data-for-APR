### Analysis:
- The buggy function is `apply(self, other)` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class.
- The buggy function is called by `pd.date_range` in the failing test.
- The error message suggests a mismatch in inferred frequency and passed frequency.
- The GitHub issue relates to unexpected behavior when using periods and adding holidays in `pd.date_range`.

### Error Location:
The bug is likely in the calculation of business days for adjusting the time intervals based on positive or negative values of `n`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to incorrect calculation of business days and business hours for adjusting the time intervals depending on the value of `n`. This leads to discrepancies in the number of periods generated by `pd.date_range`.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the calculation of business days and business hours for adjusting the time intervals is correct based on the value of `n`.
2. Adjust the logic to handle holidays and weekends for precise time interval adjustments.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    # this is the corrected function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start or self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            business_hours_per_day = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            business_days, remaining_minutes = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours_per_day // 60)
            if n < 0:
                business_days, remaining_minutes = -business_days, -remaining_minutes

            skip_business_days = BusinessDay(n=business_days)

            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_opening = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remaining_time = other - prev_opening
                other = prev_opening + skip_business_days + remaining_time
            else:
                other += skip_business_days

            remaining_business_hours = timedelta(minutes=remaining_minutes)

            while remaining_business_hours != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    business_hour_until_close = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                else:
                    business_hour_until_open = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

                if remaining_business_hours < business_hour_until_close:
                    other += remaining_business_hours
                    remaining_business_hours = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    if n >= 0:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other) + timedelta(1)
                    else:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))
                    remaining_business_hours -= business_hour_until_close

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version aims to handle the adjustment of time intervals accurately based on the positive or negative value of `n` and considering weekends and holidays. This should resolve the issue observed in the failing test and fix the bug reported on GitHub.
