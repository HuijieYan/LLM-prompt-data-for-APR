### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `apply` method within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The function receives a `datetime` object as input, adjusts it based on business hours logic, and returns the adjusted datetime.
3. The error message indicates a ValueError raised during a frequency validation check in the test case involving `pd.date_range`.
4. The issue described on GitHub relates to the behavior of `pd.date_range` when using periods and adding holidays, highlighting discrepancies in the number of generated periods.

### Bug and Cause:
- The bug arises due to discrepancies in the inferred frequency calculations when a holiday is specified, leading to incorrect period generation.
- The error message specifically points to an issue with frequency validation based on the passed values.
- The bug originates from how the `apply` method handles adjustment of datetime objects based on business hours, potentially leading to frequency inference errors.

### Correction Strategy:
- The bug fix should focus on ensuring correct adjustment of datetime objects while handling holidays to prevent unexpected behavior in period generation.
- Ensure proper handling of holidays when adjusting datetime objects within the business hours context.

### Corrected Function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            original_time = other.time()
            original_date = other.date()
    
            # adjust other to reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                original_date.year,
                original_date.month,
                original_date.day,
                original_time.hour,
                original_time.minute,
                original_time.second,
                original_time.microsecond,
            )
            
            if self._is_on_offset(other):
                return other
    
            if n >= 0:
                while not (other.time() in self.end or self._is_on_offset(other)):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                while not (other.time() in self.start or self._is_on_offset(other)):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            # Handle holiday adjustments
            if hasattr(self, 'holidays') and original_date in self.holidays:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version focuses on more precise handling of datetime adjustments with respect to holidays to prevent the frequency validation issues reported in the GitHub bug.
