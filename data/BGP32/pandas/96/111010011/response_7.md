### Analysis:
- The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class within the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is causing an issue related to generating date ranges with custom business hours.
- The error message indicates a ValueError when trying to validate the frequency of the date range against the provided business hours.
- The GitHub issue points out that when providing a holiday, the `date_range` function produces more periods than expected.
- The issue seems to be related to incorrect adjustments and calculations made in the `apply` function when dealing with custom business hours and holidays.
- The bug needs to be fixed to align the generated date ranges correctly with the specified business hours and handle holidays appropriately.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by incorrect adjustments in the `apply` function for the case where the `other` datetime value falls on a holiday. The function does not handle holidays properly when calculating the adjusted date ranges, leading to more periods than expected.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, adjustments need to be made in the `apply` function to properly handle holidays when generating date ranges based on custom business hours. The adjustments should ensure that the date range aligns correctly with the specified business hours and considers holidays in the calculations.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:
Here is the updated version of the `apply` function that should resolve the bug:
```python
# Update the buggy function in the BusinessHourMixin class
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if self._is_on_offset(other):
            return other
        
        start_time = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, self.start.hour, self.start.minute)
        end_time = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, self.end.hour, self.end.minute)
        
        if other.time() < start_time.time():
            other = start_time
        elif other.time() >= end_time.time():
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        
        while not self.is_on_offset(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            if self._is_on_offset(other):
                break
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By updating the logic in the `apply` function to handle the date adjustments properly considering holidays and business hours, the corrected version should now align the date ranges according to the specified custom business hours and handle holidays correctly.
