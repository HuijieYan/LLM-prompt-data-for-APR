### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is responsible for adjusting datetime objects based on business hours. The issue arises when calculating business dates with holidays.
2. The error message indicates a `ValueError` raised during frequency validation for a `DatetimeArray` context, specifically related to the inferred frequency not conforming to the passed frequency.
3. The GitHub issue highlights a similar problem where using holidays with `date_range` and periods results in unexpected behavior, extending beyond the specified number of periods.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments for holidays are correctly handled within the `apply` function, aligning the business days calculation with the holidays.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the logic for adjusting business days, taking into account holidays to ensure that the correct number of periods is generated without exceeding the expected range.
- Adjust the business day calculation to consider holidays as business closure days.
- Ensure that the adjustments for business hours correctly handle the holidays when determining the next open time.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = other.replace(nanosecond=0)
            n = self.n

            # Adjust other based on business hours
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)

                # Adjust for holidays taking into account business days
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=1)
                while not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    if other in self.holidays:
                        other += skip_bd
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

                # Adjust for holidays taking into account business days
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=-1)
                while not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    if other in self.holidays:
                        other -= skip_bd

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the logic to handle holidays within the calculations, this corrected version should resolve the observed issue and align the behavior with the expected output for adjusting datetime objects based on business hours and holidays.
