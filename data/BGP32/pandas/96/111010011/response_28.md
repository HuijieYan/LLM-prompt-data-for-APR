### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is causing the issue reported in the GitHub bug report related to `pd.date_range` with holidays.
2. The error message indicates a `ValueError` raised during frequency validation in the pandas library.
3. The bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of holidays when calculating business hours.
4. The bug causes incorrect periods to be generated in the presence of holidays, as described in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Cause:
The issue seems to stem from the way the `apply` function in the `BusinessHourMixin` class handles holidays in the case of negative business hours. When adjusting for business days, the function does not properly account for holidays, leading to an incorrect number of periods being generated.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that holidays are appropriately considered when calculating business hours and adjusting datetime objects for negative business hour cases.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Import required for the fix
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour, BusinessDay

# Corrected version of the buggy function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    # Other functions in the class remain the same

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
        
            # Handle absolute business hour value first
            if n >= 0:
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
            # Get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
        
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
        
            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    other = skip_bd.rollforward(other)
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
        
            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))
                        )
        
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the logic for handling holidays within the negative business hour adjustment part, this version of the function should resolve the issue described in the GitHub report and pass the failing test.
