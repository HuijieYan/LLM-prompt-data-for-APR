### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class which is a subclass of `BusinessMixin`. The function `apply` within this class is responsible for applying business hours offsets to a given datetime.
2. The error message points to a `ValueError` being raised while validating the frequency within a datetime index.
3. The GitHub issue highlights a problem with the `date_range` method when using periods and adding holidays, leading to unexpected results.
4. The bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of business hours and holidays within the `apply` function, causing the mismatch in periods generated by `date_range`.
5. A strategy for fixing the bug could involve reviewing how business hours and holidays are applied in the `apply` function and ensuring correct adjustments to the datetime based on the provided offsets.

### Fix:
Below is the corrected version of the buggy function taking into account the identified issues and suggestions for improvement.
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            if hasattr(other, "normalize"):
                other = other.normalize()
            n = self.n
            
            # Perform adjustment based on business hours and holidays
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            # Calculate total business hours in a day
            business_hours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            
            # Calculate business days and remaining hours
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
            
            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday().is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(skip_bd + remain)
                else:
                    other += skip_bd
            
            # Remaining business hours adjustment
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        break
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        break
                    elif bhour_remain == bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        break
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making these adjustments to the function, it should address the issues related to applying business hours and holidays correctly, ensuring the `date_range` works as expected with custom business hours.
