### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is designed to adjust datetime objects based on business hours.
2. The error message indicates a failure in a test related to custom business hours and holidays in the `date_range` function, leading to an incorrect number of periods.
3. The reported issue on GitHub highlights a similar problem with `date_range` function not working correctly when specifying periods and adding holidays.
4. The root cause of the bug seems to be the incorrect handling of holidays in the `apply` function, resulting in an unexpected number of periods.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustment of datetime objects considers holidays correctly to match the expected behavior.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Check if other is a holiday, adjust accordingly
        if other.hour == 0 and other.minute == 0 and other.second == 0:
            return other
    
        if isinstance(self, CustomBusinessHour) and other.date() in self.holidays:
            other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

        # Adjust datetime object based on business hours
        n = self.n
        ...  # Existing code remains the same
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adding a check for holidays and adjusting the behavior accordingly, the corrected version of the function should now handle custom business hours and holidays correctly, resolving the issue with the failing test and the GitHub problem.
