### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is supposed to adjust a datetime value based on business hour offsets. It handles positive and negative offsets differently to arrive at the adjusted datetime value.
2. The potential error locations in the buggy function could be the logic surrounding adjustments for positive and negative offsets, handling of business days, adjusting remaining business hours, and the check for `other` being a datetime instance.
3. The bug appears to be related to the incorrect adjustment of datetime values based on the business offsets. The error message indicates a problem with frequency validation when adding holidays, which might be caused by incorrect adjustments leading to an increased number of periods.
4. To fix the bug, we should ensure that the adjustments for positive and negative offsets are correctly handled, taking into account the presence of holidays. Additionally, the business day adjustments and remaining business hour adjustments need to be revised for accuracy.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function in the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Adjustments to handle positive and negative offsets
            if self.n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # Adjust to move to the previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(minutes=1)
                    while other not in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
       
            # Total business hours in one business day
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

            # Number of business days and remaining business hour minutes
            bd = self.n // businesshours
            r = self.n % businesshours

            # Adjust by business days first
            days_offset = pd.DateOffset(days=1) if self.n < 0 else pd.DateOffset(days=-1)
            skip_bd = pd.offsets.BusinessDay(n=bd)
            while skip_bd > pd.Timedelta(0):
                other = other + days_offset
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                skip_bd -= pd.offsets.BusinessDay()

            # Remaining business hour adjustments
            if r != 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                while pd.Timedelta(minutes=r) > pd.Timedelta(seconds=0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if pd.Timedelta(minutes=r) <= bhour:
                        other += pd.Timedelta(minutes=r)
                        break
                    other += bhour
                    r -= bhour.total_seconds() // 60
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making the adjustments as described above, the corrected function should now handle offset adjustments accurately even when holidays are involved. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub as well.
