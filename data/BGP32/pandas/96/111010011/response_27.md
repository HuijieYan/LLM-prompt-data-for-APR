### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is a method within the `BusinessHourMixin` class. It is used to apply business hours to a datetime object.
2. The error message indicates a `ValueError` is raised while trying to validate a frequency in the `_validate_frequency` function due to a mismatch between inferred frequency and the passed frequency.
3. The issue on GitHub highlights a problem where `pd.date_range` produces unexpected results when using periods and adding holidays with `CustomBusinessHour`.
4. The bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of holidays within the `apply` function, causing extra periods to be generated when holidays are included.
5. To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the function handles holidays to ensure the correct number of periods is generated.


### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `apply` function to properly handle holidays and adjust the calculation of business days. We can introduce a check to determine if a day is a holiday and adjust the datetime accordingly. Here is the corrected version:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # adjust by business days first, considering holidays
            if bd != 0:
                while bd != 0:
                    if other.date() in self.holidays:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    else:
                        bd -= 1
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
    
            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    # business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = (
                        self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    )
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        # finish adjusting if possible
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        # go to next business time interval
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    # business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if (
                        bhour_remain > bhour
                        or bhour_remain == bhour
                        and nanosecond != 0
                    ):
                        # finish adjusting if possible
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        # go to next business time interval
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(
                                other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                            )
                        )
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function should properly handle holidays and adjust the datetime calculation accordingly. It will prevent the extra periods generated due to holidays, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
