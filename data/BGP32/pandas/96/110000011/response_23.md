## Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class has an issue related to handling the adjustment of business days and business hours when used in conjunction with `CustomBusinessHour` in Pandas. This issue is interfering with the correct calculation of datetime values, leading to unexpected behavior in date_range with periods and adding holidays.

## Error Location:
The error seems to be related to the adjustment of business days and business hours within the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. Specifically, the problematic part might be in the logic for adjusting remaining business hours and shifting to the next business time interval.

## Cause of Bug:
The bug observed in the GitHub issue occurs when using `pd.date_range` with periods and adding holidays. It seems that the offset logic in the `apply` function is not handling the adjustment of business hours correctly, leading to the generation of more than the expected number of periods in the date_range.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to revise the logic within the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class to ensure that the adjustment of business days and business hours works accurately. By correctly handling the adjustments based on the provided parameters like periods and holidays, we can resolve the issue reported on GitHub.

## Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `apply` function in the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Adjusting other to proper datetime object
            other = other.replace(microsecond=0)
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # Adjust business days first
            if n != 0:
                other += BusinessDay(n=n)

            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=n * 60)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                else:
                    bhour = other - self._next_opening_time(other)

                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    if n >= 0:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                    else:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(other - timedelta(seconds=1))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making these adjustments to the `apply` function, the bug related to date_range with periods and holidays should be resolved, resulting in the correct calculation of datetime values.
