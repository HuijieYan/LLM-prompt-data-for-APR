### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is responsible for applying business hours to a given datetime object. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that when utilizing `pd.date_range` with periods and additional holidays, unexpected behavior occurs, leading to more periods being generated than specified.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Calculation of business hours in a day may be incorrect.
2. Handling of holidays may be causing discrepancies.
3. Adjustment of business days and remaining business hours may have errors.

### Bug Cause:
The bug may arise from incorrect adjustments made for holidays and business days within the `apply` function. This could lead to the incorrect calculation of the number of periods in `pd.date_range` when additional holidays are provided.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure accurate calculation of business hours in a day.
2. Correctly handle holidays to prevent unexpected changes in the number of periods.
3. Verify adjustments for business days and remaining hours are processed correctly.
