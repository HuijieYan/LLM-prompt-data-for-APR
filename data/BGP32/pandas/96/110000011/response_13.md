### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is responsible for adjusting datetime values based on business hours. The issue reported on GitHub is related to the usage of `pd.date_range` with periods and holidays not producing the expected result.

### Identified Potential Error Locations:
1. Calculating the business hours variable might have an issue.
2. Adjusting the datetime value based on business days could be problematic.
3. Calculating the remaining business hours might not be correct.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by incorrect calculations and adjustments within the `apply` function. When working with periods and adding holidays, the function may not be handling the calculations and adjustments correctly, leading to unexpected results in `pd.date_range`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check and correct the calculations related to business hours and adjustments.
2. Ensure that the adjustments for business days and remaining business hours are accurate.
3. Verify the logic for moving to the next business time interval.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        remaining_periods = abs(n)
        start_time = as_datetime(other)

        for _ in range(remaining_periods):
            start_time = self._next_opening_time(start_time)
        
        return start_time
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version simplifies the logic for adjusting the datetime value based on business hours and should now handle periods and holidays correctly.
