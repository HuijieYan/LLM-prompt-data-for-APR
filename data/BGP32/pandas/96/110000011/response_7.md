## Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which is related to custom business hour offsets. The GitHub issue describes a problem with the `date_range` function not working correctly when using periods and adding holidays.

## Identified error location:
The bug in the `apply` function may be causing the unexpected behavior when adding holidays to the business hour offset.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug in the `apply` function is related to the calculation and adjustment of business days and hours when applying the custom business hour offset. This incorrect calculation may lead to an incorrect output when adding holidays in combination with periods.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the calculation of business days and hours in the `apply` function is accurate, taking into account the presence of holidays within the custom business hour offset. Additionally, the adjustment for holidays needs to be handled correctly to align with the expected behavior of the `date_range` function.

## Bug-fixed version of the function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd, holidays=self.holidays)
                if not skip_bd.on_offset(other):
                    other = skip_bd.rollforward(other)
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This bug-fixed version of the `apply` function should address the issue reported on GitHub by correctly handling business days, hours, and holidays in the custom business hour offset, ensuring that `date_range` works as expected.
