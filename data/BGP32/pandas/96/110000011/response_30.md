### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which is related to the GitHub issue titled "Pandas date_range does not work when using periods and adding holiday".
2. The buggy function takes a `datetime` object as input and adjusts it based on business hours specified by the mixin.
3. The bug seems to be related to the calculation of business days and business hours, leading to incorrect adjustments when holidays are involved, as seen in the GitHub issue description.
4. A strategy to fix the bug would involve refining the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours to ensure correct behavior when holidays are present.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function fails to handle holidays correctly when adjusting business days and remaining business hours. This results in incorrect adjustments of the `datetime` object, causing the unexpected behavior observed in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to refine the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours in the `apply` function. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessHour, BusinessDay

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            bd, r = divmod(abs(self.n * businesshours // 60), businesshours // 60)

            if self.n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = other + skip_bd

            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if self.n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

                if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    if self.n >= 0:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                    else:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should address the issue where holidays were causing unexpected behavior in adjusting the `datetime` object based on business hours and days.
