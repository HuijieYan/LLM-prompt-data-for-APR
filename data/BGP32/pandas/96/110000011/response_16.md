### Analysis:
1. The GitHub issue involves a problem with the `pd.date_range` function when using periods and adding holidays with the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency.
2. The buggy function in the `BusinessHourMixin` class of the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file seems to be related to the issue.
3. The bug is likely causing the incorrect generation of dates when using periods and adding holidays in the `pd.date_range`.
4. The bug appears to be related to the logic of adjusting the datetime based on business hours and holidays within the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class.

### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to be caused by improper handling of the adjustment of business hours and holidays within the `apply` function. It leads to incorrect calculations and generates more periods than expected, as described in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic within the `apply` function to properly handle the adjustment of business hours based on holidays and the specified periods. The correction should ensure that the datetime calculations align with the provided parameters and do not generate additional periods due to incorrect adjustments.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the apply function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if isinstance(self, CustomBusinessHour):
            return self.apply_custom_business_hour(other)

    raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

def apply_custom_business_hour(self, other):
    curr_datetime = other
    if self.holidays and curr_datetime in self.holidays:
        curr_datetime = self._next_opening_time(curr_datetime)

    if not self._is_on_offset(curr_datetime):
        curr_datetime = self._next_opening_time(curr_datetime)
        curr_datetime = self._get_closing_time(curr_datetime)

    return curr_datetime
```

By restructuring the logic within the `apply` function and introducing a new method `apply_custom_business_hour` to handle the specific case of `CustomBusinessHour` with holidays, the bug should be resolved. This correction ensures proper adjustment of business hours while considering holidays, preventing the generation of extra periods as observed in the GitHub issue.
