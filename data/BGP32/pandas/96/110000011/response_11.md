## Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is responsible for adjusting the given datetime object based on business hours. The bug reported in the GitHub issue seems to be related to incorrect behavior when adding holidays in combination with periods for `pd.date_range`.

## Potential error locations:
1. Adjusting the input datetime based on business hours.
2. Handling skipped business days due to negative business hours.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug seems to be related to how the `apply` function adjusts the given datetime object based on business hours and holidays. The incorrect behavior is causing the `date_range` function to produce more periods than expected due to the incorrect adjustment of the given datetime.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustment of the input datetime correctly considers holidays and adjusts the time based on business hours. Additionally, handling negative business hours and skipped business days should be corrected to ensure the correct behavior when adding holidays.

## Corrected version of the function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            
            # Check if the given date is a holiday, then adjust the date
            if self.is_on_holiday(other):
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            
            # Handle adjusting based on business hours
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = other + skip_bd

            # Adjust remaining business hours
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    
                if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    other += bhour
                    if n >= 0:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    else:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and handle the adjustment of the given datetime object based on business hours and holidays correctly.
