## Analysis:
The buggy function in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is causing issues when combining business hours with datetime objects for the `CustomBusinessHour` offset. The bug seems to relate to the calculation of business hours and the adjustment of datetime objects based on the specified business hours.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Calculating the total business hours by seconds in one business day.
2. Adjusting the datetime object based on positive or negative business days.
3. Handling the remaining business hours to adjust within the business time intervals.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `apply` function is likely causing the incorrect calculation and adjustment of the datetime object when using `CustomBusinessHour` along with holidays. Due to the improper handling of business hours and business days, the output of `pd.date_range` shows unexpected periods with the inclusion of holidays.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure proper calculations of business hours in a day.
2. Correctly adjust the datetime object based on positive or negative business days.
3. Handle the remaining business hours within the defined business time intervals.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Remove nanosecond attribute usage due to edge conditions
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            # Adjusting other datetime based on business hours and days
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            # Get total business hours in seconds for one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n) * 60, businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # Handling adjustment based on positive or negative business days
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = self.next_bday.apply(other) if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other) else other + skip_bd
    
            # Adjust remaining business hours within business time intervals
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other) + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

By applying the suggested corrections and optimizations in the above corrected version of the `apply` function, the bug related to combining business hours with datetime objects in the presence of holidays should be resolved.
