### Analysis:
The bug seems to be related to the behavior of the `CustomBusinessHour` offset in the `pandas` library when combined with `date_range` and holidays. The provided buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which is likely used by the `CustomBusinessHour` offset.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Calculating the business day adjustment `bd` and `r`.
2. Business day adjustment logic.
3. Adjustment of business hours based on positive or negative input.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused due to incorrect adjustment of business days and business hours in the `apply` function when calculating the date and time with respect to business hours and holidays. This results in unexpected behavior when calculating periods using `CustomBusinessHour` with holidays specified.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the calculation of business days and business hours based on positive or negative input.
2. Ensure correct handling of holidays when adjusting the date.
3. Verify the logic for business day adjustments and adjustment of remaining business hours.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            if other.time() not in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        bd = abs(n) * 60 // businesshours if n >= 0 else -abs(n) * 60 // businesshours
        
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        r = abs(n) * 60 % (businesshours // 60)
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta():
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta()
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta():
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta()
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug report by adjusting the business days and business hours properly when calculating the dates based on business hours and holidays specified.
