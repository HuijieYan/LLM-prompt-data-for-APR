### Analysis:
The buggy function in the `BusinessHourMixin` class relates to the issue reported on GitHub regarding the behavior of the `pd.date_range` when using periods and adding holidays. The bug appears to be causing an incorrect number of periods to be generated when holidays are included in the frequency.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The calculation and adjustment of business days and business hours might be erroneous.
2. Handling of holidays within the business hour calculation may cause unexpected behavior.
3. The adjustment of `other` datetime might not be correctly updated based on the business hours and days.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the buggy function might be due to incorrect adjustments in business days and business hours when dealing with holidays. When holidays are introduced, the calculation of periods based on CustomBusinessHour might not be accurate, leading to discrepancies in the output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the calculations for business days, business hours, and adjustment of the datetime based on the business hours are correctly handled, especially when holidays are involved. Proper consideration of holidays in the business hour calculations should be implemented.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which addresses the issues mentioned above:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            if n == 0:
                return other
            
            is_negative = n < 0
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
            total_minutes = abs(n) * 60
            
            if is_negative:
                total_minutes = -total_minutes
            
            business_days, remaining_minutes = divmod(total_minutes, businesshours // 60)
            
            if n < 0:
                business_days = -business_days
            
            adjusted_datetime = other
            
            if business_days != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=business_days)
                if not self._is_on_offset(adjusted_datetime + skip_bd):
                    adjusted_datetime = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_datetime)
                    adjusted_datetime = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_datetime + skip_bd)
                else:
                    adjusted_datetime += skip_bd
            
            remaining_timedelta = timedelta(minutes=remaining_minutes)
            
            while remaining_timedelta != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    next_closing_time = self._get_closing_time(adjusted_datetime)
                    business_hour = next_closing_time - adjusted_datetime
                else:
                    next_opening_time = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_datetime)
                    business_hour = next_opening_time - adjusted_datetime

                if remaining_timedelta >= business_hour:
                    adjusted_datetime += business_hour
                    remaining_timedelta -= business_hour
                else:
                    adjusted_datetime += remaining_timedelta
                    remaining_timedelta = timedelta(0)
                
                if n < 0:
                    adjusted_datetime = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(adjusted_datetime - timedelta(seconds=1)))
            
            return adjusted_datetime
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `apply` function aims to address the bug causing discrepancies in periods generation when including holidays in the frequency calculation. By ensuring accurate adjustments for business days and business hours, along with proper holiday handling, the corrected function should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
