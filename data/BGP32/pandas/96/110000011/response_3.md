### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is related to custom business hour offsets. The issue reported on GitHub involves unexpected behavior when using `date_range` with custom business hours and holidays, resulting in more periods than expected.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The adjustment logic in the `apply` function might be causing the issue.
2. Handling of holidays during the adjustment process could be incorrect.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to arise from how the `apply` function handles the adjustment of business hours when holidays are involved. It fails to correctly account for holidays and adjust the datetime based on the business hours, leading to an incorrect number of periods in the resulting `date_range`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the adjustment logic in the `apply` function needs to be revised to properly handle holidays and ensure that the datetime adjustments align with the business hours, producing the expected number of periods in the `date_range`.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        original_other = other

        # Handle holidays - Skip business hours falling on holidays
        while other in self.holidays or not self._is_on_offset(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        if n >= 0:
            while n > 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                n -= 1
        else:
            while n < 0:
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                n += 1

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version ensures that the adjustment of datetime based on business hours considers holidays and properly calculates the required periods in the `date_range`.
