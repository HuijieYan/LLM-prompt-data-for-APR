### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is being used in the context of custom business hours, specifically in the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency for generating date ranges in pandas. The issue reported on GitHub is related to the behavior of the date_range function when specifying periods and adding holidays with the `CustomBusinessHour`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Calculating business hours per day may result in incorrect holiday handling.
2. Adjusting `other` datetime based on business days may not handle holidays properly.
3. Adjusting remaining business hours may have issues regarding handling holidays and off-hours.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the way the `apply` function handles adjustments based on business days and remaining business hours. When a holiday is encountered during the adjustment process, it may lead to skipped periods or incorrect datetime values in the output, as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the holiday dates are properly handled within the adjustment process. Specifically, when moving to the next business day or adjusting remaining hours, the function should account for holidays and adjust the datetime accordingly.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `apply` function in the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            orig_other = other
            
            while n != 0:
                if n > 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                
                while not self._is_on_offset(other) or other.date() in self.holidays:
                    if n > 0:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    else:
                        other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                
                n = n - 1 if n > 0 else n + 1
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the adjustment process is revised to properly handle holidays by ensuring that the datetime skips over the holidays and maintains the correct number of periods as intended. This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub regarding the behavior of the `date_range` function with `CustomBusinessHour` and holidays.
