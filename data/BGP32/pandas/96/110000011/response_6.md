### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class which is a mixin class for managing business hour offsets.
2. The GitHub issue raises a problem related to using `pd.date_range` with custom business hour offsets and holidays, where the number of periods generated is incorrect when holidays are included.
3. The bug is caused by the incorrect calculation and adjustment of business hours in the `apply` function, leading to unexpected results in the generated date range.
4. To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for adjusting business hours in the `apply` function to accommodate holidays properly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that holidays are properly handled in the calculation of business hours.
2. Adjust the logic for determining the next opening and closing times based on the presence of holidays.
3. Correctly handle the calculation of business days and remaining business hours.
4. Update the function to return the correct adjusted datetime object.

### Buggy Function (Corrected Version):
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessHour, BusinessDay

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            holidays = getattr(self, 'holidays', [])
            while n != 0:
                if n > 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    if any(h == other for h in holidays):
                        n -= 0
                    else:
                        n -= 1
                else:
                    other = self._prev_closing_time(other)
                    if any(h == other for h in holidays):
                        n += 0
                    else:
                        n += 1
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, additional logic has been added to handle holidays properly and adjust the business hours without counting holidays when determining the next opening and closing times. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
