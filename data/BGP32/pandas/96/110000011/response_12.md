## Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is responsible for adjusting the given `datetime` object based on business hours, but it seems to have issues when handling different cases, especially when dealing with business days and remaining business hours.

The GitHub issue reported by a user showcases a problem where adding holidays results in more periods being generated than expected, leading to unexpected behavior in the date range.

## Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of business days adjustment.
2. Incorrect calculation of remaining business hours.
3. Incorrect iteration through business time intervals.

## Cause of Bug:
The bug seems to stem from how the function adjusts the given `datetime` object for business hours, especially when dealing with negative `n` (indicating the subtraction of business hours) and handling business days with holidays. These conditions lead to incorrect adjustments and unexpected behavior, as reported in the GitHub issue.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure proper adjustment of business days when `n` is negative.
2. Correctly calculate and handle the remaining business hours to adjust.
3. Improve the iteration through business time intervals based on remaining business hours.
4. Address the holidays implementation to avoid generating more periods than expected.

## Corrected Version:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            total_mins = abs(self.n * 60)

            # Adjusting for business days and remaining hours based on n
            if self.n >= 0:
                while total_mins > 0:
                    remaining_mins = (self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other).seconds // 60
                    mins_to_adjust = min(remaining_mins, total_mins)
                    other += timedelta(minutes=mins_to_adjust)
                    total_mins -= mins_to_adjust
                    if total_mins > 0:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                while total_mins > 0:
                    remaining_mins = (self._next_opening_time(other) - other).seconds // 60
                    mins_to_adjust = min(remaining_mins, total_mins)
                    other += timedelta(minutes=mins_to_adjust)
                    total_mins -= mins_to_adjust
                    if total_mins > 0:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1)
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the adjustment of business days and remaining hours is handled more accurately to ensure that the adjustments are made correctly based on the specified business hour offsets.

By correcting the logic for handling negative business hours `n` and better managing the remaining business hours, this version aims to resolve the issue reported on GitHub regarding unexpected behavior when adding holidays in the date range with periods.
