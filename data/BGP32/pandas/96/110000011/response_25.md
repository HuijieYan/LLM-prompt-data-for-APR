### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class seems to be responsible for the unexpected behavior described in the GitHub issue. The issue is related to `pd.date_range` not working as expected when combining business hours with holidays and periods. This results in more than the specified number of periods being generated.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of adjustment for business days.
2. Incorrect adjustment of remaining business hours.
3. Logic for moving to the next business time interval might be flawed.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to stem from the incorrect adjustment of business days and remaining business hours within the `apply` function. This leads to an incorrect calculation of the number of periods generated, especially when holidays are involved.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure accurate adjustment of business days by considering the impact of holidays.
2. Correctly adjust the remaining business hours within each business time interval to prevent exceeding the specified number of periods.
3. Validate the logic for moving to the next business time interval and handling edge cases.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `apply` function that addresses the buggy behavior:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            if n > 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=n, holidays=self.holidays)
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + skip_bd)
            elif n < 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=n, holidays=self.holidays)
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other - skip_bd)
    
            while n != 0:
                if n > 0:
                    business_time_left = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                else:
                    business_time_left = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                
                if abs(n) >= business_time_left.total_seconds() // 60:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + business_time_left)
                    n = 0
                else:
                    other += timedelta(minutes=(n * 60))
                    n = 0
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version includes adjustments for business days considering holidays and ensuring accurate calculation of the remaining business hours within each interval.

By implementing these corrections, the `apply` function should now work correctly when used in conjunction with `pd.date_range` involving periods, holidays, and business hours.
