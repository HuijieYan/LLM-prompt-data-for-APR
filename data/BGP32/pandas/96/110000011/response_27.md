## Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is used to adjust a given `datetime` object based on business hours. The issue described on GitHub involves using the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency in `pd.date_range` with holidays, resulting in unexpected behavior where more periods are generated than expected.

## Bug Location:
The bug likely originates in the logic within the `apply` function that adjusts the input `datetime` object based on business hours and potentially introduces an issue when handling holidays.

## Bug Cause:
The bug seems to be related to how the adjustment of the given datetime object is handled in the presence of holidays. The adjustment logic within the `apply` function might not correctly account for holidays, leading to the discrepancy observed in the GitHub issue.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `apply` function to properly handle holidays while adjusting the given datetime object based on business hours.

## Corrected Version:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            n = self.n
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = self.next_bday.apply(other)  # Use next_bday apply instead of direct manipulation

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        break
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        if bhour_remain == bhour and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0:
                            other += bhour_remain
                            break
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, adjustments are made to ensure that holidays are properly handled during the process of adjusting the given datetime object based on business hours. This fix aims to address the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
