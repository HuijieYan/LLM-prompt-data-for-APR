## Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in `BusinessHourMixin` class is related to the GitHub issue regarding the behavior of `pd.date_range` when using `CustomBusinessHour` with holidays and periods. The issue is that when holidays are included in the frequency and periods are specified, the output contains more values than the specified periods.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of business days when adjusting the datetime.
2. Loop conditions for adjusting business hours might be incorrect.
3. Calculating business hours by seconds might be causing discrepancies.
4. Handling of holidays and business hours might be incorrect.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect adjustment of business hours, especially when dealing with holidays. The logic for adjusting the datetime based on business hours and holidays is not handling all edge cases properly, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure correct adjustment of business days and business hours when dealing with positive and negative offsets.
2. Verify the logic for handling holidays and adjust the datetime accordingly.
3. Improve the loop conditions for adjusting business hours to accurately meet the specified periods.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour, BusinessMixin, BusinessDay

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            start = self.start
            end = self.end
            holidays = getattr(self, 'holidays', None)  # New: Get holidays if defined
            
            target_datetime = other
            
            if n >= 0:
                if target_datetime.time() in end or not self._is_on_offset(target_datetime):
                    target_datetime = self._next_opening_time(target_datetime)
            else:
                if target_datetime.time() in start:
                    target_datetime -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(target_datetime):
                    target_datetime = self._next_opening_time(target_datetime)
                    target_datetime = self._get_closing_time(target_datetime)
            
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(start, end)
            )
            
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
            
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if holidays and any(h == target_datetime.date() for h in holidays):
                    # Skip holidays
                    target_datetime += skip_bd
                else:
                    remaining_time = target_datetime - self._prev_opening_time(target_datetime)
                    target_datetime = self._prev_opening_time(target_datetime) + skip_bd + remaining_time
            
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(target_datetime)) - target_datetime
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(target_datetime) - target_datetime
                
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    target_datetime += bhour
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    if holidays and any(h == target_datetime.date() for h in holidays):
                        # Skip holidays
                        target_datetime = self._next_opening_time(target_datetime)
                else:
                    target_datetime += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            
            return target_datetime
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the logic for handling holidays, making necessary changes in the business day calculations, and refining the loop conditions for adjusting business hours, the corrected version of the `apply` function should now work as expected with periods and holidays in the frequency settings.
