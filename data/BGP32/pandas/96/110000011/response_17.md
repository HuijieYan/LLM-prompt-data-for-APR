### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is responsible for adjusting dates based on business hours. The bug reported in the GitHub issue relates to an unexpected behavior when using periods and adding holidays, particularly in the context of `pd.date_range`.

### Error Location:
The bug likely stems from the logic in the `apply` function and how it handles the adjustment of dates when holidays are involved.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the `apply` function failing to correctly handle the adjustment of dates within business hours when holidays are specified. This leads to incorrect behavior when generating date ranges with periods that fall on or around holidays.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic within the `apply` function to properly account for holidays when adjusting dates within business hours. Specifically, we need to ensure that holidays are correctly considered in the date adjustment process.

### Corrected Version:
Here is a corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
import pandas as pd
from pandas.tseries.holiday import AbstractHolidayCalendar, Holiday

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, pd.Timestamp):
            n = self.n
            holidays = getattr(self, "holidays", [])
            
            while n != 0:
                if n > 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    if other.normalize().date() in holidays:
                        continue
                    n -= 1
                else:
                    other -= pd.Timedelta(seconds=1)
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    if other.normalize().date() in holidays:
                        continue
                    n += 1
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version adjusts the dates based on business hours while appropriately considering any holidays specified. Now the `apply` function should work correctly when generating date ranges with periods and adding holidays, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
