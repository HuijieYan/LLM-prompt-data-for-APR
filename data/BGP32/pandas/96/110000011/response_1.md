## Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is responsible for adjusting datetime objects based on business hour offsets. The issue described on GitHub involves using the `CustomBusinessHour` offset with a holiday list within `pd.date_range` resulting in an unexpected number of periods. This behavior points to a bug in the logic of the `apply` function that is affecting the generation of datetime indices in the presence of holidays.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Adjustment of the input datetime based on business hour rules.
2. Handling of business day adjustments when moving across multiple days.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be related to how the adjustments for business hour offsets are calculated and applied within the `apply` function. Specifically, the handling of holidays might not be properly integrated into the adjustment logic, leading to the unexpected behavior observed in the GitHub issue.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To resolve the bug and address the GitHub issue, the `apply` function needs to be modified to correctly incorporate holiday handling when adjusting the datetime objects based on the business hour offsets. Proper adjustment of business days, business hours, and consideration of holidays when moving between days should be ensured for the correct calculation of periods in `pd.date_range`.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# corrected version of the apply method
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # handle holidays
        if hasattr(self, 'holidays') and other.date() in self.holidays:
            next_business_day = self._next_business_day(other)
            return self.apply(next_business_day)

        # adjust other to reset time components
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        # adjust datetime based on business hour rules
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # business hour calculations
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # business day adjustments
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        # remaining business hours calculations
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By properly considering holidays and adjusting the datetime objects based on business hour rules within the corrected `apply` function, the issue encountered in the GitHub report should be resolved.
