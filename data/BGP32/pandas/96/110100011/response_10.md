### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is responsible for adjusting a given `datetime` object based on business hours, start times, and end times.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in `test_date_range.py` is related to the GitHub issue `Pandas date_range does not work when using periods and adding holiday`.
3. The bug causes the `pd.date_range` function to produce more periods than expected when a holiday is added to the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `apply` function to correctly handle holidays when determining the business hours.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Identify the holiday days and ensure that the adjustment in business hours skips the holiday days.
2. Modify the logic to account for holidays while calculating the business hours and adjusting the datetime object accordingly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if not isinstance(other, pd.Timestamp):
            other = pd.Timestamp(other)
            
        businessdays = self.businessday.offsets
        holidays = self.holidays
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        total_hours = abs(n) * 60
        bd, r = divmod(total_hours, businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = np.sign(bd) * businessdays[0] * abs(bd)
            adjusted_date = other + skip_bd
            if adjusted_date in holidays:
                adjusted_date = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_date)
            other = adjusted_date

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying this corrected version of the `apply` function, the issue reported in the GitHub bug description should be resolved, and the failing test should pass successfully.
