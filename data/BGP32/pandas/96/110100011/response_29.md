### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the file `pandas/tseries/offsets.py`.
2. The test code provided in `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is failing due to unexpected behavior when using holidays in conjunction with periods while generating date ranges with custom business hours.
3. The GitHub issue `Pandas date_range does not work when using periods and adding holiday` highlights the incorrect output generated in certain scenarios when using `date_range` with custom business hours and holidays.
4. The bug appears to be related to the calculations within the `apply` function when adjusting date ranges based on business hours and holidays.
5. The bug can be fixed by modifying how the adjustment of date ranges is performed when holidays are involved.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to incorrect calculations in the `apply` function when adjusting a date based on the specified business hours and holidays. The issue leads to the unexpected behavior observed when generating date ranges with periods and adding holidays.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To resolve the bug, we need to adjust the logic within the `apply` function to correctly handle holidays while calculating the date ranges based on custom business hours. It involves refining the adjustments made when holidays are present to ensure the correct number of periods are generated without skipping or duplicating any dates.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if not isinstance(other, date):
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
        
        n = self.n
        
        if not self._is_on_offset(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        
        total_seconds = abs(n * 60) * 60
        bd, r = divmod(total_seconds, businesshours)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
                    
        if n >= 0:
            while r >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                if r < bhour.total_seconds():
                    other += timedelta(seconds=r)
                    break
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                r -= bhour.total_seconds()
        else:
            while r <= 0:
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if r > -bhour.total_seconds() or (r == -bhour.total_seconds() and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += timedelta(seconds=r)
                    break
                other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(
                                other - bhour
                            )
                        )
                r += bhour.total_seconds()
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By refining the adjustment logic in the `apply` function, we aim to resolve the bug causing unexpected behavior when generating date ranges with custom business hours and holidays.
