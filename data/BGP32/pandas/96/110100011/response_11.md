1. Analysis:
   - The buggy function is `apply(self, other)` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the file `pandas/tseries/offsets.py`.
   - The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py` highlights the issue related to custom business hours and holidays causing unexpected behavior in generating date ranges.
   - The GitHub issue `Pandas date_range does not work when using periods and adding holiday` further describes how adding holidays results in more periods than expected in date ranges.

2. Error locations:
   - The issue seems to stem from the logic within the `_next_opening_time`, `_get_closing_time`, and adjustment sections of the `apply` function.
   - The handling of business hours, business days, and adjusting for holidays needs to be revised to correct the bug.

3. Cause of the bug:
   - The bug arises from improper adjustment logic when combining business hours with holidays in the `apply` function. The incorrect adjustment leads to an unexpected increase in periods when holidays are included in the frequency, as seen in the failing test and GitHub issue.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
   - Revise the adjustment logic in the `apply` function to properly handle holidays and business hours to ensure the correct number of periods in date ranges when holidays are included.
   - Focus on adjusting for business hours, business days, and holidays in a way that aligns with the intended behavior of custom business hours.

5. Corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            
            if n >= 0:
                if not self._is_on_offset(other) or other.hour > self.end_hour:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if not self._is_on_offset(other) or other.hour < self.start_hour:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
            
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = self.next_bday.apply(other)
                bd_adj = other
                
                while not self._is_on_offset(bd_adj):
                    bd_adj = self.next_bday.apply(bd_adj)
                other = bd_adj
                
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            curr_time = other
            
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(curr_time) - curr_time
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        curr_time += bhour_remain
                        break
                    else:
                        curr_time = self._next_opening_time(curr_time + bhour)
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                else:
                    bhour = curr_time - self._get_closing_time(curr_time)
                    if bhour_remain < bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        curr_time -= bhour_remain
                        break
                    else:
                        curr_time = self._prev_opening_time(curr_time) - timedelta(seconds=1)
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                
            return curr_time
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function should address the bug by adjusting for business hours, holidays, and periods correctly, aligning with the expected behavior described in the failing test and GitHub issue.
