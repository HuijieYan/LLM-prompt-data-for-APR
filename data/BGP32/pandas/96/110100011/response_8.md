### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which is a mixin class that extends `BusinessMixin`.
2. The buggy function `apply` is supposed to handle adjustments to datetime objects based on business hours, but it has issues handling holidays and periods accurately.
3. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` highlights the issue when generating a date range with custom business hours, holidays, and periods. The output does not match the expected values due to incorrect handling of holidays.
4. The GitHub issue describes a similar problem where adding holidays to `pd.date_range` with custom business hours and periods results in unexpected behavior.
5. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of holidays in the `apply` function.


### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `apply` function arises from the incorrect handling of holidays when adjusting datetime objects based on business hours. When calculating the adjusted datetime with holidays, the function does not correctly skip the holiday dates in the calculation, leading to an incorrect number of periods being generated in the date range.


### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `apply` function needs to be modified to properly skip holiday dates when adjusting datetime objects based on business hours. This involves checking if the adjusted datetime falls on a holiday and appropriately adjusting it to the next valid business day.


### Corrected Version:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # original code
            ...
            
            # adjust for holidays
            if self.holidays:
                while other in self.holidays:
                    if n >= 0:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + timedelta(days=1))
                    else:
                        other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            
            # business hours calculation
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            
            # original code
            ...

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, the code snippet for adjusting for holidays ensures that the adjusted datetime skips the holiday dates correctly. This modification should resolve the issue of incorrect date ranges when combining custom business hours, holidays, and periods.
