## Analysis:
1. The buggy function is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The buggy function `apply` is supposed to adjust a given datetime object based on business hours.
3. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is related to creating a date range with custom business hours and holidays.
4. The GitHub issue describes a scenario where adding holidays along with periods in the `pd.date_range` function results in unexpected behavior, producing more than the specified number of periods.

## Identified Issue:
The bug seems to be caused by incorrect adjustments made to the datetime object based on business hours and holidays. This leads to the `pd.date_range` function generating more periods than expected when holidays are incorporated.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the datetime object is manipulated within the `apply` function to ensure correct handling of business hours and holidays.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        bd = self._business_day_offset(other)
        n = self.n * 60  # Convert hours to minutes

        if n >= 0:  # Adjust forward
            for i in range(abs(n)):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                while (other.date() in self.holidays) or (other.time() not in self.start):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        else:  # Adjust backward
            n = abs(n)
            for i in range(n):
                other = other.replace(second=0, microsecond=0)
                while (other.date() in self.holidays) or (other.time() not in self.start):
                    other = other - timedelta(minutes=1)
                while (other.date() not in self.holidays) and (other.time() not in self.start):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

        # Adjust based on business days
        other = other + (bd*BusinessDay())
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version adjusts the datetime object according to business hours and holidays in a more straightforward and logically correct manner, ensuring the correct number of periods is generated by `pd.date_range`.
