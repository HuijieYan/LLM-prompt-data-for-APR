### Analysis:
1. The provided buggy function is a part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class within `pandas/tseries/offsets.py`.
2. The function `apply` is responsible for applying business hour offsets to a given datetime.
3. The failing test scenario involves setting a CustomBusinessHour offset starting at 15:00 with a holiday on 2020-11-26 and creating a date range starting at 2020-11-25 15:00 for 4 periods.
4. The bug causes the date range to produce more than the expected 4 periods when holidays are added.
5. The bug is identified in how the function handles the adjustment of business hours and business days, resulting in an incorrect output for date ranges.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of the adjustment of business hours and business days within the `apply` function. This leads to the unexpected behavior when creating date ranges with CustomBusinessHour offsets and holidays.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the adjustment of business days and business hours needs to be revised to ensure the correct number of periods are generated when holidays are taken into account. Proper handling of the offset calculations is crucial to resolve this issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)

            closed_dates = set(self.holidays)
            start_date = other

            if n >= 0:
                while bd > 0:
                    start_date = start_date + timedelta(days=1)
                    if start_date.weekday() > 4 or start_date in closed_dates:
                        continue
                    bd -= 1

                work_hours = []
                for i in range(r):
                    while True:
                        start_date = start_date + timedelta(hours=1)
                        if start_date.weekday() < 5 and start_date not in closed_dates:
                            work_hours.append(start_date)
                            break

            else:
                while bd < 0:
                    start_date = start_date - timedelta(days=1)
                    if start_date.weekday() > 4 or start_date in closed_dates:
                        continue
                    bd += 1

                work_hours = []
                for i in range(abs(r)):
                    while True:
                        start_date = start_date - timedelta(hours=1)
                        if start_date.weekday() < 5 and start_date not in closed_dates:
                            work_hours.append(start_date)
                            break

            return work_hours
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version of the `apply` function, the adjustment of business days and hours is handled more accurately to ensure that the generated date ranges align with the provided parameters. This correction should fix the bug causing unexpected results when creating date ranges with CustomBusinessHour offsets and holidays.
