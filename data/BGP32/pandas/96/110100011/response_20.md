## Analysis:
- The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class.
- The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is checking the behavior of `pd.date_range` with custom business hours and holidays.
- The issue reported on GitHub highlights the problem that when using periods and adding holidays, `pd.date_range` produces unexpected results.

## Error Location:
1. The calculation of business days and remaining business hours seems to be incorrect.
2. Adjusting the `other` datetime based on business days and business hours needs revision.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by incorrect handling of adjustments for custom business hours and holidays in the `_apply` function. This leads to incorrect calculations and the generation of more than the expected number of periods in `pd.date_range`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Make sure to correctly adjust the `other` datetime based on the custom business hours and holidays provided.
2. Review the calculations related to business days and remaining business hours to ensure accurate adjustments.

## Corrected Version:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            original_other = other
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            current_date = other
            normed_current_date = date(current_date.year, current_date.month, current_date.day)
    
            # iterating through each day to handle holidays
            while current_date != original_other:
                if current_date in self.holidays:
                    current_date = self._next_opening_time(current_date + timedelta(days=1)).replace(hour=self.start[0].hour, minute=self.start[0].minute, second=0, microsecond=0)
    
                current_date = current_date.replace(hour=self.start[0].hour, minute=self.start[0].minute, second=0, microsecond=0)
                businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
                
                if n >= 0:
                    while current_date.time() not in self.start:
                        current_date = self._next_opening_time(current_date)
                        current_date = self._get_closing_time(current_date)
                
                if current_date == original_other:
                    break
    
                current_date = current_date + timedelta(seconds=businesshours)
            
            return current_date
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the calculation logic within the `apply` function, the corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
