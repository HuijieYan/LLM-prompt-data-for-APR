### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py` is related to the issue in GitHub regarding incorrect behavior of `pd.date_range` when using periods and adding holidays with `CustomBusinessHour`.
3. The buggy function has issues with adjusting dates based on business hours, which leads to incorrect behavior when holidays are involved.
4. The bug is causing `pd.date_range` to produce more periods than expected when holidays are included.
5. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `apply` function to properly handle the adjustment of dates based on business hours and holidays.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # existing code

            # adjust for holidays
            if self.holidays and other in self.holidays:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            # remaining code remains the same
```

### Updated version of the buggy function:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # existing code
            if isinstance(other, datetime):
                # used for detecting edge condition
                nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
                # reset timezone and nanosecond
                # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
                other = datetime(
                    other.year,
                    other.month,
                    other.day,
                    other.hour,
                    other.minute,
                    other.second,
                    other.microsecond,
                )
                n = self.n
        
                # adjust for holidays
                if self.holidays and other in self.holidays:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                
                # get total business hours by sec in one business day
                # remaining code remains the same
            else:
                raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This fix should address the bug and make the `pd.date_range` function work correctly with `CustomBusinessHour` when holidays are involved.
