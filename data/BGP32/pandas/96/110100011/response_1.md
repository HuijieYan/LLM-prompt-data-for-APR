### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file, which is related to custom business hours and holidays.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py` specifically tests the behavior when using custom business hours with holidays in `date_range`.
3. The GitHub issue "Pandas date_range does not work when using periods and adding holiday" highlights the unexpected behavior of `date_range` when using custom business hours with holidays and periods.
4. The bug seems to be causing the date_range to generate more periods than expected when holidays are included, leading to incorrect output.

### Error Location:
The issue seems to stem from the logic in the `apply` function while handling adjustments for holidays and business hours combined.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `apply` function leads to incorrect adjustment of datetime values when holidays are involved along with custom business hours, resulting in extra periods being generated in `date_range` output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the adjustment logic within the `apply` function needs to correctly handle the cases where holidays are present to ensure the number of periods generated in `date_range` is accurate and aligns with the expected behavior.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Adjusting logic here to fix the buggy behavior
        target_date = other
        n = self.n
        if self._is_on_offset(other):
            target_date += timedelta(minutes=n)  # Move target date by n minutes
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)  # Get total business hours
                            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        days, remainder = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)  # Calculate days and remainder
        
        if n < 0:  # Adjust for negative changes
            days, remainder = -days, -remainder
        
        skip = BusinessDay(n=days)  # Skip the specified number of business days
        target_date += skip  # Update target date with the skipped business days
        
        if n >= 0:
            while remainder > 0:  # Loop until all remaining time is adjusted
                next_open = self._next_opening_time(target_date)
                business_hour_diff = next_open - target_date
                if remainder < business_hour_diff.total_seconds() / 60:  # Adjust if possible
                    target_date += timedelta(minutes=remainder)
                    remainder = 0
                else:
                    target_date = self._next_opening_time(next_open)  # Move to next open time
                    remainder -= business_hour_diff.total_seconds() / 60
        else:  # Negative adjustment
            while remainder != 0:
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(target_date)
                business_hour_diff = target_date - prev_open
                if business_hour_diff.total_seconds() / 60 >= remainder:
                    target_date -= timedelta(minutes=remainder)
                    remainder = 0
                else:
                    target_date = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(target_date))  # Move to next closing time
                    remainder -= business_hour_diff.total_seconds() / 60
        
        return target_date
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function addresses the bug by adjusting the datetime values properly when holidays are involved with custom business hours, ensuring the correct number of periods is generated by `date_range`.
