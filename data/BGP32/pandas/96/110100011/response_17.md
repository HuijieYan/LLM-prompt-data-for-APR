### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class.
2. The failing test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is testing the behavior of `pd.date_range` with a custom business frequency that includes holidays.
3. The issue reported on GitHub mentions that when using periods along with holidays in `pd.date_range`, the output contains more periods than expected.
4. The bug seems to be related to the calculation of business hours and handling of holidays within the `apply` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to incorrect adjustment of business days and business hours when calculating the new date with custom business frequencies including holidays in the `apply` function. This leads to unexpected behavior in the number of resulting periods.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, adjustments are required in the logic for handling business days, business hours, and holidays in the `apply` function. Specifically, the calculations for business days and hours need to be corrected to ensure the expected behavior when including holidays.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour


class BusinessHourMixin:    
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            other = as_datetime(other)

            current = other
            while n != 0:
                if n > 0:
                    current = self._next_opening_time(current)
                    if current in self.start:
                        current += self
                        n -= 1
                else:
                    if current in self.end:
                        current -= self
                        n += 1
                    current = self._prev_opening_time(current)
            
            return current
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function should address the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.
