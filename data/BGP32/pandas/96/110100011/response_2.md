### Analysis:
- The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class within the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
- The bug seems to be related to incorrect adjustment of business days while calculating the date range with custom business hours and holidays.
- The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py` highlights the issue where adding holidays causes more periods than expected in the date range.
- The GitHub issue `Pandas date_range does not work when using periods and adding holiday` reported a similar problem where the output has more entries than expected when using periods and holidays together.

### Bug Description:
- The bug occurs due to improper adjustment of business days when calculating the date range with custom business hours and holidays. The calculation does not handle the case of holidays correctly, leading to an incorrect number of periods in the date range.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling business days and holidays in the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. Specifically, the adjustment for holidays needs to be correctly integrated to ensure the generated date range has the expected number of periods.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), self.nhours * 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version includes adjustments to handle business days and holidays accurately in the calculation of the date range with custom business hours. The logic has been improved to align with the expected behavior of generating the correct number of periods within the specified range.
