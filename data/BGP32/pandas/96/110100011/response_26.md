### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is causing issues with the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency when holidays are provided. This bug is related to the failing test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in the GitHub issue. The issue indicates that when using `pd.date_range` with `periods` and holidays, it produces unexpected results with more periods than expected. 

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect adjustment of business days in the presence of holidays.
2. Improper handling of the remaining business hours.
3. Inconsistent behavior regarding when to finish adjusting the hours.

### Bug Cause:
The root cause of the bug is in the logic of adjusting business days and remaining business hours within the `apply` function. The function does not handle holidays correctly, leading to an incorrect number of periods being generated in `pd.date_range`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `apply` function needs to be modified to correctly adjust business days, handle holidays, and adjust remaining business hours. Proper logic for calculating the business days and handling the remaining hours based on the presence of holidays is essential.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            other += skip_bd

        while r > 0:
            if n >= 0:
                next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
                bhour = next_opening - other
            else:
                next_closing = self._next_opening_time(other)
                bhour = next_closing - other

            if r <= bhour.seconds // 60:
                other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                break
            else:
                other = next_opening if n >= 0 else next_closing
                r -= bhour.seconds // 60

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and pass the failing test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.
