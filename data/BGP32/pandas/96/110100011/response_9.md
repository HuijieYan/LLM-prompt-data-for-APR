### Analysis:
- The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is responsible for adjusting dates and times based on business hours and holidays.
- The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in the test file is related to the bug, as it demonstrates an issue with generating date ranges when using custom business hours and holidays.
- The GitHub issue points out that the `pd.date_range` function produces more periods than expected when holidays are added, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Error Locations:
1. The adjustment of business days and remaining business hours in the function.
2. Handling of cases for positive and negative business hours.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from incorrect adjustments of business days and business hours in the `apply` function. The function fails to properly account for holidays leading to extra periods in the generated date ranges.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Properly adjust the business days and remaining business hours based on holidays to generate the correct date ranges.
2. Ensure that adjustments for both positive and negative business hours work correctly by accounting for holidays.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            n = self.n

            other_date = other.date()
            is_holiday = other_date in self.holidays
            next_opening_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
            prev_opening_time = self._prev_opening_time(other)

            if n >= 0:
                if is_holiday or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = next_opening_time
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if is_holiday or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = next_opening_time
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            business_hours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    remain = other - prev_opening_time
                    other = prev_opening_time + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(prev_opening_time) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After implementing these changes, the corrected version of the function should now handle adjustments based on holidays correctly, allowing the associated test to pass and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
