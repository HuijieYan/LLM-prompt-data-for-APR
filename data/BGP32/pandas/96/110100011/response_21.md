## Analysis
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is causing issues when used with custom business hours and holidays in the `pd.date_range` function. The failing test specifically mentions an incorrect number of periods being generated when holidays are added.

## Potential Error Locations
1. Calculation of `businesshours` does not seem to accurately represent the total business hours in a day.
2. Adjustment logic for handling positive and negative business hour values.
3. Iteration to adjust remaining business hours.

## Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by incorrect logic when adjusting business hours based on the specified business hours and holiday settings. This leads to the generation of incorrect date ranges with unexpected periods due to the flawed adjustment handling within the `apply` function.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Address the calculation of `businesshours` to accurately represent the total business hours in a day.
2. Improve the adjustment logic for positive and negative business hour values to correctly adjust the dates based on the specified conditions.
3. Update the iteration process to adjust remaining business hours in a precise manner.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        adjusted_date = other

        for _ in range(abs(self.n)):
            adjusted_date = self._adjust_date(adjusted_date, businesshours)

        return adjusted_date
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

def _adjust_date(self, start_date, business_hours):
    adjusted_date = start_date
    if self.n >= 0:
        while self.n > 0:
            adjusted_date = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_date)
            businesshours = self._get_business_hours_by_sec(self.start[0], self.end[0])
            adjusted_date += timedelta(seconds=businesshours)
            self.n -= 1
    else:
        while self.n < 0:
            adjusted_date = self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_date)
            businesshours = self._get_business_hours_by_sec(self.start[0], self.end[0])
            adjusted_date -= timedelta(seconds=businesshours)
            self.n += 1

    return adjusted_date
```

By making these corrections in the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class, the issue reported in the GitHub post should be resolved.
