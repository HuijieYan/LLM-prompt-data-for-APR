### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class and is used for adjusting timestamps based on business hours. The issue arises when the function is used with custom holidays, leading to incorrect behavior in calculating the number of periods.

The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` highlights this issue by showing that when custom holidays are included, the number of periods generated by `pd.date_range` does not match the expected result.

The GitHub issue reported clarifies that the `pd.date_range` function behaves unexpectedly when using periods and adding holidays. It produces more periods than expected due to the incorrect handling of custom holidays in combination with business hours.

### Errors:
1. Incorrect calculation of the number of business days (`bd`) and remaining business hours (`bhour_remain`).
2. Inadequate handling of timestamps when adjusting for custom holidays and business hours.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to discrepancies in calculating and adjusting timestamps when factoring in custom holidays while maintaining business hours.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `apply` function to properly handle custom holidays while ensuring the correct calculation of business days and remaining business hours. Proper adjustments when encountering custom holidays are crucial to maintain the expected behavior of the function.

### Corrected Code:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            business_hours = self._get_business_hours_by_sec(self.start[0], self.end[0])

            n = self.n
            holidays = getattr(self, "holidays", None)

            adjusted_time = other
            while n != 0:
                if n > 0:
                    adjusted_time = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_time)
                    if holidays and adjusted_time in holidays:
                        adjusted_time = self._get_closing_time(adjusted_time)
                    n -= 1
                else:
                    adjusted_time = self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_time)
                    if holidays and adjusted_time in holidays:
                        adjusted_time = self._get_closing_time(adjusted_time)
                    n += 1

            remaining_periods = self.is_on_offset(other) + self._get_business_time_diff(adjusted_time, other)
            remaining_periods %= business_hours

            if remaining_periods:
                if self.n >= 0:
                    adjusted_time += timedelta(seconds=(business_hours - remaining_periods) // 60)
                else:
                    adjusted_time -= timedelta(seconds=remaining_periods // 60)

            return adjusted_time
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making these adjustments, the corrected `apply` function should now handle custom holidays properly and calculate the adjusted timestamps based on the provided business hours. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue reported.
