### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class which is related to custom business hour functionality in pandas.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is checking for the behavior of `pd.date_range` with custom business hours and holidays.
3. The GitHub issue points out that when using `pd.date_range` with custom business hours, `periods`, and adding holidays, the output is incorrect.
4. The bug seems to be related to how holidays are handled in combination with custom business hours which causes the incorrect number of periods in the output.
5. The bug arises from how adjustments are made in the `apply` function when dealing with negative business days.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the logic in the `apply` function to correctly handle negative business days and holidays in the calculation of the new datetime.
2. Ensure that the adjustments for business days and business hours are correctly accounted for based on the given parameters.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    curr_closing = self._get_closing_time(other)
                    bhour = curr_closing - other if curr_closing > other else timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                adjust_time = min(bhour_remain, bhour)
                other += adjust_time
                bhour_remain -= adjust_time
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the logic in the `apply` function to properly handle the negative business days and holiday combinations, the corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing test provided.
