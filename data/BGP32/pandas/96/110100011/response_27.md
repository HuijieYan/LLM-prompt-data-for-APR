### Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class within the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file. It is used to adjust the specified `datetime` object based on business hours. The bug seems to be related to the calculation of business hours and the adjustment of the `datetime` object. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is related to using custom business hours with holidays while generating a date range.

The GitHub issue describes a scenario where adding holidays to the custom business hours leads to unexpected behavior in generating date ranges. Instead of producing the expected 14 periods, it produces more due to incorrectly adjusting the business hours based on holidays.

### Potential Error Locations
1. Calculation of businesshours might be incorrect.
2. Adjustments based on positive or negative business days might be faulty.
3. Handling of remaining business hours and adjustment intervals could be problematic.

### Bug Cause
The bug seems to be caused by incorrect calculations and adjustments within the `apply` function. When holidays are introduced, the function fails to properly adjust the business hours leading to more periods in the date range than expected.

### Strategy for Fixing
1. Ensure correct calculation of business hours.
2. Properly handle adjustments for positive and negative business days.
3. Fix the handling of remaining business hours and adjustment intervals.

### Corrected Version
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        ...
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        full_business_days = n // (businesshours // 60)
        remaining_minutes = n % (businesshours // 60)
        
        if n < 0:
            # Adjust for negative business days
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            other = other + timedelta(days=full_business_days)
            
            while remaining_minutes != 0:
                bhour = self._prev_closing_time(other) - other
                if bhour.total_seconds() > abs(remaining_minutes) * 60:
                    other += timedelta(minutes=remaining_minutes)
                    break
                remaining_minutes += bhour.total_seconds() // 60
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other) - BusinessHour()

            return other
        else:
            # Adjust for positive business days
            other = other + timedelta(days=full_business_days)
            
            while remaining_minutes != 0:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour.total_seconds() >= remaining_minutes * 60:
                    other += timedelta(minutes=remaining_minutes)
                    break
                remaining_minutes -= bhour.total_seconds() // 60
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

            return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Summary
The corrected version of the `apply` function should now properly adjust the `datetime` object based on business hours even when holidays are introduced, ensuring that the date range generation works as expected with custom business hours and holidays.
