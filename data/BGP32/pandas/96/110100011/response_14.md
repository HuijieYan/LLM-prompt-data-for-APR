### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in `pandas/tseries/offsets.py`.
2. The failing test relates to custom business hours and holidays in `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py`.
3. The bug is causing inconsistencies in the output of `pd.date_range` when using periods and adding holidays, leading to more periods than expected.
4. The bug occurs due to incorrect adjustment of business days and hours in the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class.
5. To fix the bug, we need to correct the calculations for adjusting business days and hours based on the specified business frequency.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure proper handling of business day adjustments based on the specified frequency.
2. Correct the adjustment of remaining business hours within each business day.
3. Verify the opening and closing times for holidays to align with the expected behavior of `pd.date_range`.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, second=0, microsecond=0)
    
            current_day_offset = self._is_on_offset(other)
    
            if n >= 0:
                if not current_day_offset or other.time() not in self.end:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if current_day_offset:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n), 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + (other - prev_open)
            else:
                other += skip_bd
    
            allowed_hours = (businesshours // 60) - other.hour
            if (n >= 0 and r > 0) or (n < 0 and r < 0):
                end_of_day = self._get_closing_time(self.start[0])
                if r > allowed_hours * 60:
                    other += timedelta(days=1) if n >= 0 else timedelta(days=-1)
                elif r > 0 and r > allowed_hours * 60 - other.minute * 60 - other.second:
                    other = end_of_day
                else:
                    other += timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the adjustments of business days, hours, and handling holidays properly, the corrected version of the `apply` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue related to unexpected behavior in `pd.date_range` with custom business hours and holidays.
