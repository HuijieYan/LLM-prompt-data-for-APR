### Analysis:
- The buggy function `apply()` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `offsets.py` file of the pandas library.
- The buggy function is causing issues with custom business hours when holidays are included, as mentioned in the failing test and GitHub issue.
- The current implementation of the function is not handling the adjustment of business hours correctly when holidays are present, leading to incorrect results in date ranges.
- The issue reported on GitHub describes the problem where the date range produces more than the specified number of periods when holidays are included.
- The proposed test function demonstrates this issue by failing to match the expected DatetimeIndex.
  
### Bug Explanation:
- The bug occurs because the `apply()` function does not properly adjust the business hours when holidays are involved.
- During the adjustment process in the function, the presence of holidays and the corresponding handling of business hours are not appropriately implemented, leading to incorrect date range calculations.
- This results in unexpected DatetimeIndex outputs with more periods than specified when holidays are included in the custom business hour frequency.
  
### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to enhance the adjustment logic within the `apply()` function to properly handle business hours in the presence of holidays.
- Ensure that the adjustment process considers holidays when calculating business hours and adjusting datetime values.
- Update the logic to accurately determine the business hours within each business time interval, accounting for holidays and adjusting dates accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the `apply()` function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Check if user provided holidays to adjust business hours
            if self.holidays is not None:
                holiday_dates = {d.date() for d in self.holidays}

                while other.date() in holiday_dates:  # Skip holidays
                    other += timedelta(days=1)

            start = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, self.start.hour, self.start.minute)
            end = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, self.end.hour, self.end.minute)

            duration = end - start

            periods, remainder = divmod((self.n if self.n >= 0 else -self.n) * 60, (duration.seconds // 60))

            if self.n < 0:
                periods = -periods

            final_result = start

            if periods != 0:
                final_result = start + periods * duration

            if remainder != 0:
                if self.n >= 0:
                    while remainder > 0:
                        final_result += timedelta(minutes=1)
                        if final_result.time() >= end.time() or (self._is_holiday(final_result) or self._is_weekend(final_result)):
                            final_result = self._next_opening_time(final_result)
                else:
                    while remainder > 0:
                        final_result -= timedelta(minutes=1)
                        if final_result.time() < start.time() or (self._is_holiday(final_result) or self._is_weekend(final_result)):
                            final_result = self._get_closing_time(final_result)

            return final_result

        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply()` function includes enhancements to properly adjust business hours in the presence of holidays, addressing the bug that caused incorrect date ranges when custom business hours and holidays were combined.
