## Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `offsets.py` file of the `pandas` library.
2. The test function is testing the behavior of `pd.date_range` with custom holidays and reveals an issue where the number of periods is incorrect when holidays are included.
3. The issue stems from the `apply` function in the `BusinessHourMixin` class not handling holidays correctly, leading to an incorrect number of periods being generated when creating a date range with custom business hours and holidays.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `apply` function to properly account for holidays when adjusting the date and time based on custom business hours.
5. The corrected version of the `apply` function is provided below:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Save nanosecond and reset timezone
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = as_datetime(other)
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

                if bhour_remain < bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    if n >= 0:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                    else:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return as_datetime(other)
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By updating the `apply` function as shown above, the issue with incorrect periods when adding holidays should be resolved.
