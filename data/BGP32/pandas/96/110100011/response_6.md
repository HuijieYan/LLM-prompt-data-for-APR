### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The buggy function is related to custom business hours and holidays.
3. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is a part of the test file `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py`.
4. The GitHub issue relates to incorrect behavior observed when using periods and adding holidays to generate date ranges.
5. The bug seems to be related to the adjustment of business days and hours with custom holidays, leading to incorrect results in the date range generation.

### Bugs/Cause:
- The bug is due to discrepancies in adjusting business days and hours when custom holidays are included.
- The adjustment logic in the `apply` function might not correctly handle scenarios where holidays impact the calculation of business days and hours.

### Fix Strategy:
- Adjust the logic in the `apply` function to properly account for custom holidays when calculating business days and hours.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # adjust to ensure datetime has no timezone or nanosecond
            other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, nanosecond=0)
            n = self.n
    
            # check if other is on the offset or go to the next relevant time
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            # calculate total business hours in a day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            # calculate business days and remaining hours
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                check_offset = not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other)
                if check_offset:
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            # adjust remaining hours dynamically based on conditions
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and other.nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making these corrections to the `apply` function, the bug related to custom holidays and date range generation should be resolved.
