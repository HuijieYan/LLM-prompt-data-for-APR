### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The error occurs in the `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` function in the `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py` file, where it fails to create the expected `DatetimeIndex` due to an error related to frequency validation.
3. The error message indicates a `ValueError` during the frequency validation process when comparing the inferred frequency with the passed frequency, specifically related to the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency.
4. The bug in the function may be related to the adjustment of business days and business hours within a time interval not accurately handling the custom business hour frequencies.
5. One strategy to fix the bug is to review and modify the logic for adjusting the business days and hours to ensure accurate handling of custom business hour frequencies.
  
### Bug Fix:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # existing code ...
    
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # existing code ...
            
            # adjust business days using CustomBusinessHour logic
            if bd != 0:
                business_hour = CustomBusinessHour(self.start[0].strftime("%H:%M"), self.end[0].strftime("%H:%M"))
                other = business_hour.rollback(other)
                other = business_hour.rollforward(other + skip_bd)
                
            # adjust remaining business hours using CustomBusinessHour logic
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    business_hour = CustomBusinessHour(self.start[0].strftime("%H:%M"), self.end[0].strftime("%H:%M"))
                    other = business_hour.rollforward(other)
                    bhour = business_hour.end_time - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    business_hour = CustomBusinessHour(self.start[0].strftime("%H:%M"), self.end[0].strftime("%H:%M"))
                    other = business_hour.rollforward(other)
                    bhour = other - business_hour.start_time
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other -= bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With this modification, the `apply` function should accurately adjust for custom business hours and pass the failing test without raising a `ValueError`.
