### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is not correctly handling the case when `other` is an instance of `datetime`. This is leading to an error in the test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` which is expecting certain datetime values to be generated correctly.

### Errors in the buggy function:
1. The conversion of `other` to a `datetime` object is not handled properly as it loses some attributes like timezone and nanosecond.
2. The adjustment for negative `n` values is not working correctly.
3. Handling of business days adjustment and remaining business hours adjustment needs correction.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function is not correctly adjusting the input datetime object `other` based on the business day offset `n` and the custom business hours defined. This leads to incorrect datetime values being returned, causing the test function to fail.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure all attributes of the input `other` datetime object are preserved during conversion.
2. Correct the business day offset adjustment for negative `n` values.
3. Properly handle adjustments for business days and remaining business hours.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to preserve attributes
        other = other.replace(hour=other.hour, minute=other.minute, second=other.second, microsecond=other.microsecond)

        # adjust based on business hours
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n) * 60, businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday().is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        # adjust remaining business hours in intervals
        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and other.nanosecond != 0):
                other += bhour_remain
                break
            bhour_remain -= bhour
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying the above fix, the corrected function should handle the adjustments correctly and pass the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.
