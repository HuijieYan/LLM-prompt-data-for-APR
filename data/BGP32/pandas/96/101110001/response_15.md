### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class that is inheriting from `BusinessMixin`.
2. The bug seems to be related to the application of the custom business hour offset in the `apply` function.
3. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is trying to create a date range with a custom business hour frequency, and the bug seems to prevent the correct recreation of the date range.
4. The error message indicates that the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency, which is causing the test failure.
5. The bug could be related to how the custom business hour offset is being applied and adjusted within the `apply` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the inferred frequency to be `None`, which leads to a validation error when trying to create the expected date range because the inferred frequency does not conform to the custom business hour frequency.
The bug most likely occurs in the logic that adjusts the date according to the business hours within the `apply` function.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the custom business hour offset applied correctly and that the adjusted date maintains the frequency information. We should adjust the logic of how the business hour offset is applied and handle the adjustment of the dates more accurately.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            bhour = self._get_business_hours_by_sec(self.start[0], self.end[0])
    
            business_days = bd // bhour
            remaining_hours = bd % bhour
    
            if business_days != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=business_days)
                other += skip_bd
    
            if r != 0:
                if n >= 0:
                    remaining_time = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                else:
                    remaining_time = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
    
                while remaining_hours > 0:
                    if remaining_hours > remaining_time.total_seconds() / 60:
                        other += remaining_time
                        remaining_hours -= remaining_time.total_seconds() / 60
                        remaining_time = self._get_business_hours_by_sec(self.start[0], self.end[0])
                    else:
                        other += timedelta(minutes=remaining_hours)
                        remaining_hours = 0
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By applying the corrections to adjust the date based on the business hours accurately, the corrected function should now correctly handle custom business hour offsets.
