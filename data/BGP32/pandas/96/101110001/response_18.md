### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of a class `BusinessHourMixin` which has several other methods used within `apply`.
2. The error occurs in the test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`, where `CustomBusinessHour` frequency is applied to `pd.date_range`.
3. The error message indicates a frequency validation issue related to `DateOffset`.
4. The bug seems to be related to the handling of business hours and the adjustment of dates and times within the `apply` function.

### Bug Cause:
- The error seems to be caused by incorrect adjustments made to the `other` datetime object within the `apply` function. This potentially leads to invalid frequency detection.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Review the logic of adjusting the `other` datetime object to ensure it aligns with the business hours correctly.
- Check the business day calculations and adjustments to ensure they are applied accurately.
- Verify the frequency validation process to detect and fix any discrepancies.

### Corrected Code:
```python
# Corrected apply function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # other methods here...

    # Corrected apply function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                while not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = skip_bd.apply(other)

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other - bhour))
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

By adjusting the logic in the `apply` function to handle the business hour shifts correctly while adjusting the datetime object `other`, the corrected code should now pass the failing test.
