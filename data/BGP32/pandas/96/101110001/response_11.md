### Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The error message indicates that the frequency does not conform to the expected value, causing a `ValueError`. This points to a problem within the logic of adjusting the time based on the business hour offset.

The main issue appears to be in the calculation and adjustment of the time based on the business hours and offsets. The error message suggests that the frequency inferred from the values does not match the passed frequency.

### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to be caused by incorrect adjustment and calculation of time when applying the business hour offset. The bug affects the final result of the time calculation, leading to a mismatch in the inferred frequency.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the time calculation and adjustments within the `apply` function are correctly performed based on the business hour offset. By properly handling the adjustments and considering edge cases, we can ensure that the resulting time matches the expected frequency.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
     
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))
            
            business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)

            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = skip_bd.rollback(other)

            if r != 0:
                bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    if n >= 0:
                        bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                    else:
                        bhour = other - self._next_opening_time(other)
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other = self._get_next_opening_time(other)
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                    else:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version improves the time calculations and adjustments based on the business hour offset, which fixes the original bug causing the frequency mismatch error.
