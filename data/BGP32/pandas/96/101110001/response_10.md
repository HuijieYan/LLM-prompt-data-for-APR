### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class and is responsible for applying certain adjustments to a datetime based on business hour offsets. The function seems to have an issue with handling the adjustment of business days and remaining business hours correctly, leading to errors when trying to apply custom business hour offsets.

The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is trying to create a date range with custom business hours, but it throws a `ValueError` during frequency validation. This error occurs due to incorrect adjustments within the `apply` function.

### Bug Location:
1. Incorrect adjustment of business days and remaining business hours.
2. Possible issue with handling start and end times in the datetime object.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `apply` function seems to stem from the incorrect calculation of business days and remaining business hours, leading to improper adjustments. This results in the failure to create a valid date range with custom business hours.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Fix the business day adjustment logic to correctly handle moving to the previous business day when necessary.
2. Update the handling of remaining business hours to ensure that the adjustments are correctly applied within the business time intervals.

### Updated Corrected Function:
```python
    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            n = self.n
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n), businesshours // 60)

            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                for _ in range(abs(bd) - 1):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + skip_bd)
                if n < 0:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                if n < 0:
                    bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other

                if abs(bhour.total_seconds()) > bhour_remain.total_seconds():
                    if n < 0:
                        other -= bhour_remain
                    else:
                        other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    if n < 0:
                        other = self._prev_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1)
                    else:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    bhour_remain -= abs(bhour)
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making these adjustments in the corrected `apply` function, the bug causing the `ValueError` in the failing test should be fixed. The corrected version now handles the business day and remaining business hour adjustments more accurately.
