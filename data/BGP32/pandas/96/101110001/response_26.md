### Analysis:
- The error message indicates a ValueError related to frequency validation when creating a DatetimeIndex.
- The failing test function is testing date_range with custom holidays using CustomBusinessHour frequency.
- The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is responsible for adjusting the datetime based on business hours.

### Bug:
- The bug seems to be in the logic of adjusting the datetime based on business hours within the `apply` method.
- The adjustments made to the datetime in the `apply` method are not handling the CustomBusinessHour frequency correctly, leading to the frequency validation error.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Since the error is related to frequency validation, the bug fix will involve adjusting the `apply` method to handle CustomBusinessHour frequency appropriately.
- Specifically, the adjustments made to the datetime should consider the CustomBusinessHour frequency to ensure the generated DatetimeIndex conforms to the expected frequency.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` method:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            # adjust other based on CustomBusinessHour frequency
            if isinstance(self, CustomBusinessHour):
                other = other.replace(minute=self.nhour, second=0, microsecond=0)
            
            for _ in range(abs(n)):
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
- In the corrected version, we are first checking if the frequency is a `CustomBusinessHour` and adjusting the other datetime object accordingly.
- Then, we directly adjust the datetime object based on the sign of the offset `n`.
- This corrected version should handle the CustomBusinessHour frequency correctly and pass the failing test.
