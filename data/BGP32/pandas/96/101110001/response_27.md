### Analysis:
- The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class which extends `BusinessMixin`.
- The error message indicates a `ValueError` is raised during a frequency validation process (`_validate_frequency` method).
- The test that fails is related to a custom business hour frequency.
- The failing test creates a custom business hour frequency starting at 15:00 with a specified holiday.
- The test expects specific timestamps based on this custom business hour frequency, but the buggy function's calculations seem to deviate from the expected behavior.

### Bug Cause:
- The `apply` function is supposed to adjust timestamps based on business hours and handle different cases for positive and negative offsets. However, the logic inside the function has some issues that lead to incorrect adjustments.
- It seems that the logic inside the `apply` function related to adjusting timestamps based on business days and remaining business hours is not correctly handling the input timestamps and frequency, leading to the returned timestamps being incorrect.
- This incorrect handling results in the calculated timestamps not matching the expected values in the failing test, triggering the `ValueError` during frequency validation.

### Fix Strategy:
- The `apply` function needs to be corrected to properly adjust timestamps based on business hours and handle different offset cases accurately. 
- Care must be taken when adjusting the timestamps for positive and negative offsets, ensuring that the adjustments align correctly with the specified business hours and days.
- The adjustments for remaining business hours need to be accurate and should consider all edge cases to match the expected behavior specified by the custom business hour frequency.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessMixin, BusinessDay
from pandas._libs.tslibs.offsets import ApplyTypeError
from pandas._libs.tslibs.timedeltas import NaT, apply_wraps

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(days=1)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
            
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
                
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday().is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
            
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and other.nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making these corrections in the `apply` function, it should now handle the adjustments accurately based on the specified business hours and days, resolving the issue identified in the failing test.
