### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class seems to be causing an issue when trying to combine a business hour with a datetime object. The error message from the failing test indicates that the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency. This suggests that the logic within the `apply` function is not correctly adjusting the datetime based on the business hours.

### Identified Issue:
The bug seems to be related to how the adjustment of datetime is handled within the `apply` function based on the business hours. The logic for adjusting the datetime to the next business day, calculating business hours, and adjusting remaining business hours seems to be faulty.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the adjustment to the next business day and calculation of business hours are correctly implemented.
2. Check for any inconsistencies in how the adjustments are being made for positive and negative business hour offsets.
3. Verify that the loop for adjusting remaining business hours is functioning as expected for both positive and negative offsets.

### Bug Fix:

```python
from pandas.tseries.frequencies import CustomBusinessHour
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay
from pandas.tseries.offsets import apply_wraps
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

class BusinessHourMixin:
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - BusinessDay()
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n) * 60, businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    other = other + skip_bd
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other - timedelta(seconds=1)))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

```  

After applying these fixes, the corrected `apply` function should be able to handle the adjustment of datetimes based on business hours correctly, allowing it to pass the failing test.
