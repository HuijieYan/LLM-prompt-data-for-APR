### Analysis:
1. The function `apply` is part of the class `BusinessHourMixin` and is intended to apply business hour offsets to datetime objects.
2. The error message indicates a ValueError related to frequency validation, which suggests that the `apply` function is not handling the frequency (`freq`) correctly.
3. The `apply` function adjusts the given datetime based on business hour offsets. The bug may lie in how it handles the frequency, leading to the incorrect output.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `apply` function properly adjusts the datetime based on the business hours, taking into account the custom frequency provided.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Inspect the frequency adjustment section of the `apply` function to identify any issues.
2. Verify that the frequency is correctly handled when applying business hour offsets.
3. Make adjustments to ensure the frequency is considered in the calculation of the adjusted datetime.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessMixin, BusinessDay
from pandas._libs.tslibs.offsets import ApplyTypeError
from datetime import timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            start_time = self._get_business_hours_by_sec(self.start[0], self.start[0])[0]
            freq_minutes = self.frequency._get_minute_count()

            if self.n < 0:
                prev_opening_time = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                add_days = abs(self.n * len(self.start)) // freq_minutes
                other = prev_opening_time + timedelta(days=-add_days)

            else:
                next_opening_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
                add_days = self.n * len(self.start) // freq_minutes
                other = next_opening_time + timedelta(days=add_days)

            return other
        
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, we consider the frequency (`freq`) when adjusting the datetime based on business hours. This should address the issue and allow the test to pass successfully.
