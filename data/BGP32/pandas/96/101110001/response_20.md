### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is trying to adjust a given datetime object based on business hours specified in the `self` object. It calculates business hours, adjusts the input datetime object accordingly, and returns the adjusted datetime object. However, the bug arises from how the function handles the adjustment when `n` is negative (i.e., moving back in time).

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the function lies in the logic used when adjusting the datetime object for negative `n` values. The function uses conditions to handle different cases, but there seems to be an issue with the sequencing of adjustments and computations, especially when moving back in time.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting the datetime object when `n` is negative needs to be revisited. Specifically, the function should correctly handle the adjustments when moving back in time while considering the business hours and intervals.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other += skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain < timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain + bhour >= timedelta(0) or (bhour_remain == timedelta(0) and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain += bhour
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other - timedelta(seconds=1))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version addresses the sequencing of adjustments for negative `n` values, ensuring correct handling of moving back in time while considering business hours and intervals.
