### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` inside the `BusinessHourMixin` class. It is intended to adjust a given datetime object based on business hour offsets.
2. The error message indicates a ValueError related to frequency validation in the `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` test function. This error is triggered due to the frequency mismatch in the generated date range.
3. The buggy function is responsible for adjusting the datetime object based on business hour offsets. The error seems to be related to incorrect adjustments being made, leading to a mismatch in the date range frequencies.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments made in the `apply` function align with the expected business hour offsets to generate the correct date range.
5. Let's fix the buggy function:

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
    
            if not self.next_bday().is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            other = other + skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making the adjustments based on business day offsets and business hour intervals correctly, the corrected function should resolve the issue.
