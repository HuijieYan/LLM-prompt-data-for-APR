### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The function attempts to adjust a given datetime object based on business hours and business days.
3. The failing test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is testing the behavior with a custom `CustomBusinessHour` frequency, generating a date range with periods and checking for expected results.
4. The error message indicates a value error related to frequency validation due to a mismatch between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by an issue in the way the custom business hour frequency is handled within the `apply` function. The bug triggers due to a mismatch between the inferred frequency and the passed custom business hour frequency.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the custom business hour frequency is properly handled within the `apply` function. Specifically, we need to address the frequency validation issue by updating how the frequency is processed and validated.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the apply function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

        n = self.n
        other = pd.Timestamp(other)

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self.next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - pd.Timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self.next_opening_time(other)
                other = self.get_closing_time(other)

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            prev_open = self.prev_opening_time(other)
            other = prev_open + pd.offsets.BusinessDay(n=bd)

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = pd.Timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != pd.Timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self.get_closing_time(self.prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            else:
                bhour = self.next_opening_time(other) - other

            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                break

            bhour_remain -= bhour
            other = self.next_opening_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By using `pd.Timestamp` to handle datetime objects and adjusting the business hour calculations, the corrected function should now handle the custom business hour frequency correctly and pass the failing test case.
