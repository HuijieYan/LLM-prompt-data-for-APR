### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply(self, other)` is a method within the `BusinessHourMixin` class.
2. The error message indicates a `ValueError` related to frequency validation in the `DatetimeArray` class.
3. The issue seems to stem from the incorrect adjustment of the given datetime object `other` within the `apply` function, leading to frequency validation errors.
4. The problematic sections in the `apply` function include the adjustment logic for negative values of `n`, the calculation of business hours, and the adjustment of business days.
5. The error message suggests that the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency `CBH`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by inconsistencies in adjusting the datetime object `other` within the `apply` function, leading to incorrect frequency validation during the test.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments made to the `other` datetime object are consistent with the business hours logic and do not disrupt the expected frequency validation.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            if isinstance(other, pd.Timestamp):
                other = other.to_pydatetime()
                
            n = self.n
            
            original_other = other
            
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
                
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            
            if bd != 0:
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
            
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and original_other.nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the adjustment logic for the datetime object `other` in the `apply` function, the frequency validation error should be resolved, and the function should pass the failing test.
