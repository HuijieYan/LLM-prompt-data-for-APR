### Analysis:
The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The function attempts to adjust a given datetime object based on business hours and days specified by the offset. The error occurs when the function tries to perform this adjustment.

The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` uses a custom business hour offset, which triggers the buggy function `apply`, but it fails due to incorrect adjustment of the datetime.

### Bug:
The bug lies in the logic where the function handles adjusting the datetime object based on business hours and days. The incorrect adjustment logic results in the datetime object not aligning with the custom business hour offset.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Review the logic for adjusting the datetime object based on business hours and days.
2. Make sure the adjustment logic correctly aligns the datetime with the custom business hour offset.
3. Ensure that the adjustments for positive and negative business hours are handled correctly.
4. Update the adjustment logic to accurately account for business days and hours.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        current_time = datetime(
            other.year, other.month, other.day, other.hour, other.minute, other.second, other.microsecond
        )

        adj_time = self._get_adjusted_time(current_time, n)

        return adj_time

    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

def _get_adjusted_time(self, current_time, n):
    if n >= 0:
        while n > 0:
            current_time = self._next_opening_time(current_time)
            n -= 1
    else:
        prev_adjusted_time = None
        while n < 0:
            prev_adjusted_time = current_time
            current_time = self._prev_opening_time(current_time)
            n += 1
        # Update current_time to be the end time of the previous day
        current_time = prev_adjusted_time
    return current_time
```

By updating the adjustment logic in the `apply` function and adding a helper function `_get_adjusted_time`, we can correctly adjust the given datetime object based on the specified business hours and days. This correction should address the bug and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
