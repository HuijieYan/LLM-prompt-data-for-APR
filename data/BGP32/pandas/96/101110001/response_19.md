### Analysis:
The error message indicates a ValueError being raised during frequency validation in the `_validate_frequency` method. This error occurs when the inferred frequency from passed values does not conform to the passed frequency, specifically in the case of a `CustomBusinessHour` frequency.

The failing test involves creating a datetime range using a `CustomBusinessHour` frequency, and the error occurs during the validation of this frequency. The buggy function that needs fixing is the `apply` method within the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which is a part of the `pandas.tseries.offsets` module.

### Bug Location:
The bug likely lies within the logic of the `apply` method in the `BusinessHourMixin` class, specifically in the calculations relating to adjusting the datetime for business hours. The incorrect adjustment might be leading to the mismatch in frequencies.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by incorrect adjustments and computations made within the `apply` method, leading to an inappropriate output datetime that does not align with the expected frequency for the custom business hour. This discrepancy causes the validation error when creating the datetime index.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, the logic for adjusting the datetime within the `apply` method needs to be revisited. The adjustments for business days and business hours should be corrected to ensure that the resulting datetime aligns with the custom business hour frequency provided. 

### Corrected Version:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            # Adjust for total business hours in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # Adjust for business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = self.next_bday.apply(other)
    
            # Adjust for remaining business hours
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if (
                        bhour_remain > bhour
                        or bhour_remain == bhour
                        and nanosecond != 0
                    ):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                        )
                    )
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the adjustments and computations in the `apply` method, specifically focusing on correctly handling business days and business hours, the fixed version should now align the resulting datetime with the custom business hour frequency, resolving the validation error.
