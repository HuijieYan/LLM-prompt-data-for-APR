### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class appears to be causing the test to fail. The test is related to custom business hours and is not handling the offsets correctly.

### Bug Location:
The bug seems to be related to how the function `apply` handles the adjustment of business hours and time intervals. It fails to consider the case of custom business hours and does not adjust the timings properly.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of custom business hours within the `apply` function. It fails to properly adjust the business days based on the custom frequency, leading to an incorrect output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `apply` function properly handles custom business hours and adjusts the timings according to the specified frequency. Additionally, the adjustments for business days and remaining business hours need to be accurate for the custom business hours scenario.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is a corrected version of the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            if self.n == 0:
                return other
            
            start_time = datetime.combine(other.date(), self.start_time)
            end_time = datetime.combine(other.date(), self.end_time)
            
            adjusted_time = other
            while self.n > 0:
                if adjusted_time >= end_time or adjusted_time.time() < self.start_time:
                    adjusted_time = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_time)
                else:
                    self.n -= 1
                    if self.n > 0:
                        adjusted_time = self._next_opening_time(self._get_closing_time(adjusted_time))
            
            while self.n < 0:
                if adjusted_time <= start_time or adjusted_time.time() > self.end_time:
                    adjusted_time = self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_time)
                else:
                    self.n += 1
                    if self.n < 0:
                        adjusted_time = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(adjusted_time - timedelta(seconds=1)))
            
            return adjusted_time
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version properly adjusts the business hours and intervals based on the custom business hours specified in the input.

### Note:
Ensure that the `start_time` and `end_time` are retrieved correctly from the custom business hours settings when implementing the corrected version.
