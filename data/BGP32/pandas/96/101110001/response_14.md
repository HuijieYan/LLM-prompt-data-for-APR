### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is supposed to adjust the provided datetime based on the business hours defined by the class instance. However, it fails to handle the logic properly, resulting in the failing test.

### Bugs Identified:
1. The adjustment for negative values of `n` does not consider the case where the time provided falls in the `start` range and does not need to be adjusted.
2. The adjustment logic within the loops for adjusting by business days and remaining business hours has issues in handling the datetime adjustment correctly.
3. The function does not handle mid-business hours correctly, leading to incorrect adjustments.
4. The function does not handle the case where `other` falls within the business hours and does not need adjustment.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the adjustment logic for negative `n` to consider the case where `other` falls in the `start` range and does not need further adjustments.
2. Correct the logic for adjusting by business days and remaining business hours within the loops.
3. Handle mid-business hours by adjusting the time correctly based on the business hours specified.
4. Add logic to handle the case where `other` is already within the business hours and does not need adjustment.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if other.time() not in self.end and not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
    
            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                # midnight business hour may not be on BusinessDay
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other) and not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = other + skip_bd
    
            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    # business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        # finish adjusting if possible
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        # go to next business time interval
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    # business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        # finish adjusting if possible
                        other += bhour
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                    else:
                        break
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected version of the `apply` function should now properly handle adjustments based on the business hours specified and should pass the failing test.
