The bug in the provided function arises from the incorrect manipulation of the `other` variable, which is expected to be a `datetime` object but sometimes also a `Timestamp` object. This inconsistency in data types leads to errors when trying to perform operations on the variable.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `other` variable is consistently a `datetime` object throughout the function. We can achieve this by converting the `Timestamp` objects to `datetime` objects before further processing.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # convert Timestamp object to datetime object
        if isinstance(other, pd.Timestamp):
            other = other.to_pydatetime()
        
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        
        n = self.n

        # the rest of the function remains unchanged

    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With this correction, the function will ensure that the `other` variable is consistently a `datetime` object before performing any operations on it, hence preventing type-related errors. The function should now satisfy all the expected input/output values for the provided test cases.
