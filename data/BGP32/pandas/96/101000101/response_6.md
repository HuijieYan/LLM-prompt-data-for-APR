The bug in the provided function seems to be related to how the adjustment of the `other` datetime object is handled when calculating the next business hours. The function should adjust the datetime object based on the business hours defined in the `CustomBusinessHour` class, but there are issues in the adjustment logic that leads to incorrect results.

The `other` datetime object is adjusted based on the business hours in the `CustomBusinessHour` object, considering the `start` and `end` times. However, the adjustments and increments in the code are causing the calculation to drift away from the correct business hours.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to simplify the adjustment logic and ensure that the calculations correctly respect the business hours defined in the provided `CustomBusinessHour` class.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
    
        # adjust other to reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
    
        if n >= 0:
            # adjust for the next opening time if necessary
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjust to move to the previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This version of the function simplifies the adjustments made to the `other` datetime object, ensuring that the correct business hours are respected and applied. The logic has been clarified to avoid any discrepancies between the adjustment and the defined business hours.
