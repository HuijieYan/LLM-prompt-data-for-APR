### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is designed to adjust a timestamp by a specified number of business hours. It checks if the input parameter is a `datetime` instance, resets the timezone and nanosecond values, adjusts the timestamp, and then calculates the new adjusted timestamp based on business hours.

The bug seems to be related to the adjustment calculation for negative values of `n` (number of business hours). The function should properly handle cases where `n` is negative by going to the previous business day, adjusting the time, and finding the closing time.

### Bug Explanation:
When `n` is negative, the buggy function does not properly account for the adjustment required to reach the previous business day. This results in incorrect calculations for finding the correct closing time and leads to an incorrect final timestamp adjustment.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling negative values of `n` in the `apply` function. Specifically, we need to ensure that when `n` is negative, the function correctly adjusts to the previous business day, finds the closing time, and then proceeds with the necessary adjustments based on the remaining business hours.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
from numpy import datetime64

    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            if other.nanosecond:
                nanosecond = other.nanosecond
            else:
                nanosecond = 0
            
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                
            businesshours = 0
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end):
                businesshours += self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                if r > 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                else:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should handle negative values of `n` correctly and adjust the timestamp accordingly to align with the specified business hours.
