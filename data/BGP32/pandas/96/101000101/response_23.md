### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `apply` function is caused by an incorrect handling of business hours adjustments based on the input `other`. The function aims to adjust the input `other` based on the specified `CustomBusinessHour`. However, the logic inside the function does not correctly calculate the adjustments, leading to incorrect output values.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Make sure to correctly adjust the `other` datetime value based on the specified `CustomBusinessHour` parameters.
2. Consider edge cases such as negative `n` values and adjust the `other` datetime accordingly.
3. Verify that the adjustments are properly applied based on the business hours calculations.
4. Ensure that the input `other` is properly validated before performing any operations on it.
