The buggy function seems to be incorrectly handling the adjustment of business hours in certain cases, causing incorrect results. The potential error locations include the adjustment of business days and business hours, as well as the calculation of the remaining business hours.

The bug stems from the mishandling of the adjustment process for business days and business hours when the number of hours to adjust is negative (e.g., going back in time). Additionally, the calculation of the remaining business hours is not correctly taken into account.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustment process for business days and business hours works correctly for both positive and negative adjustments. Additionally, the calculation of the remaining business hours needs to be accurately considered in the adjustment process.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                    while other.time() not in self.end:
                        other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                while not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other = other + skip_bd

            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        break
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other) + timedelta(seconds=1)
                else:
                    bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                        other -= bhour_remain
                        break
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._prev_opening_time(other) + timedelta(seconds=-1)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle the adjustment of business days and business hours correctly for both positive and negative adjustments, considering the remaining business hours accurately as well.
