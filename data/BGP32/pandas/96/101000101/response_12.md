Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the expected input/output values, the bug in the function seems to be related to the calculation of the business hour adjustment. The issue could be caused by incorrect adjustments made to the "other" datetime object based on the business hours and business days. 

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the business hour and business day calculations properly, ensuring correct adjustments are made for both positive and negative n values.

Here is a corrected version of the function taking into account the identified bug and the expected input/output values:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # adjust timezone and microsecond
            other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0)
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            for _ in range(abs(bd)):
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self.next_bday.rollforward(other)
                else:
                    other = self.next_bday.rollback(other)

            remaining_business_hours = timedelta(minutes=r)
            current_time = other.time()

            if r == 0:
                return datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, 0, 0, 0)

            while remaining_business_hours > timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    if current_time < self.start[0]:
                        current_time = self.start[0]
                    else:
                        current_time = self._next_opening_time(
                            datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, current_time.hour, current_time.minute)
                        ).time()
                else:
                    if current_time >= self.end[0]:
                        current_time = self.get_close(second=0).time()
                    else:
                        current_time = self._prev_opening_time(
                            datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, current_time.hour, current_time.minute)
                        ).time()

                remaining_time = timedelta(
                    hours=current_time.hour,
                    minutes=current_time.minute,
                    seconds=current_time.second,
                    microseconds=current_time.microsecond,
                )
                if remaining_time <= remaining_business_hours:
                    remaining_business_hours -= remaining_time
                else:
                    return datetime(
                        other.year, other.month, other.day,
                        remaining_time.hour, remaining_time.minute, remaining_time.second, remaining_time.microsecond
                    )

            return other.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected function should now handle the adjustment of business hours based on the given input and the business hour information correctly, satisfying all the expected input/output values.
