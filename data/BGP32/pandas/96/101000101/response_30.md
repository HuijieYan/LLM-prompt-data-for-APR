### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `apply` function when it tries to adjust the input `other` datetime object based on the business hours set in the `self` object. The bug is related to the logic of adjusting the datetime object according to the business hours specified.

1. The main issue with the buggy function is in the adjustment calculations for the `other` datetime object. It fails to correctly handle cases where `n` is negative, leading to incorrect adjustments and unexpected results.

2. The function incorrectly handles the adjustment of `other` when `n` is negative, causing it to skip necessary steps resulting in incorrect adjustments.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `apply` function, we need to adjust the logic for handling negative values of `n` to correctly adjust the `other` datetime object based on the business hours specified.

### Code Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = self.next_bday.apply(other)
                other = other + skip_bd
    
            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    # business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        # finish adjusting if possible
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        # go to next business time interval
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    # business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    if (
                        bhour_remain > bhour
                        or bhour_remain == bhour
                        and nanosecond != 0
                    ):
                        # finish adjusting if possible
                        other -= bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        # go to next business time interval
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(
                                other - bhour + timedelta(seconds=1)
                            )
                        )
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the adjustment calculations for negative `n` values and adjusting the flow of the function accordingly, the `apply` function should now produce the expected results for all specified test cases.
