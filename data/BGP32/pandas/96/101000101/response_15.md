### Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the calculation of adjusted time based on business hours. The function is designed to adjust a given datetime based on business hours in a specific interval. However, there are issues in the calculation logic, which result in incorrect adjustments of the input datetime.

The bug seems to be in the part of the code where the function tries to adjust the given datetime based on business days and remaining business hours. There are issues with handling negative values of `n` (number of business hours to adjust) and the calculation of remaining business hours to adjust.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic for adjusting the given datetime based on the number of business days and remaining business hours to adjust. Specifically, we need to ensure that the adjustment for negative values of `n` is handled correctly, and the remaining business hours are calculated accurately.

### Corrected Code
Below is the corrected version of the buggy function, which addresses the issues in the original implementation:

```python
# corrected version of the function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() >= self.end[0] or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() <= self.start[0]:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            # adjust by business days first
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            remain = other - prev_open
            other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(prev_open) - other
            else:
                bhour = other - self._next_opening_time(other)
            if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                break
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version addresses the issues in adjusting the given datetime based on business hours accurately according to the expected input/output variable values provided in the cases.
