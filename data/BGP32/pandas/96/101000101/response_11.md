There are multiple issues in the buggy code provided. The main problem lies in the logic that calculates and adjusts the business hours when applying the offset. 

Here is an analysis of the issues present:
1. The handling of negative offsets is incorrect.
2. The adjustment of business days is causing unexpected behavior.
3. The calculation of remaining business hours to adjust is flawed.
4. The logic of adjusting business hours within a single day is incorrect.
5. Incorrect adjustments in certain cases based on business time intervals.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling negative offsets, adjusting business days, calculating remaining business hours, and adjusting business hours within a single day needs to be corrected. 

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        
        n = self.n
        start_time = self.start[0]
        end_time = self.end[0]
        business_hours_per_day = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(start, end) for start, end in zip(self.start, self.end)) // 60
        
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() >= end_time or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() < start_time:
                other = other.replace(hour=start_time.hour, minute=end_time.minute)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
        
        business_days_to_adjust = n // business_hours_per_day
        remaining_business_hours = n % business_hours_per_day
        
        other += timedelta(days=business_days_to_adjust)
        
        if remaining_business_hours != 0:
            if n >= 0:
                while remaining_business_hours > 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if remaining_business_hours < bhour.seconds // 60:
                        other += timedelta(minutes=remaining_business_hours)
                        break
                    else:
                        remaining_business_hours -= bhour.seconds // 60
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other) + timedelta(minutes=business_hours_per_day)
            else:
                remaining_business_hours = abs(remaining_business_hours)
                while remaining_business_hours > 0:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if remaining_business_hours < bhour.seconds // 60:
                        other += timedelta(minutes=remaining_business_hours * -1)
                        break
                    else:
                        remaining_business_hours -= bhour.seconds // 60
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1))
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the issues mentioned above and should now produce the expected results for the given test cases.
