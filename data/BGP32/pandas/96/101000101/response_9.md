The buggy function seems to have issues with adjusting the given timestamp based on business hours and days. The bug likely arises from the incorrect calculation of business days and remaining business hours, resulting in inaccurate adjustments to the timestamp.

To address the bug:
1. We need to ensure that the adjustments made to the timestamp are correct based on the provided business hours and days.
2. Be mindful of edge cases, such as when the adjustments cross over to the next business day and appropriately adjust the timestamp.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other for correct handling
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = other + skip_bd

            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other -= bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should address the issues with the given test cases and provide the expected outputs for the adjusted timestamps based on the provided business hour and day parameters.
