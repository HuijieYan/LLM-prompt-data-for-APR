### Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is intended to adjust a `datetime` object based on business hours specified in the `CustomBusinessHour` object. The function encounters bugs when handling cases where the adjustment spans multiple business days or hours.

The issues are related to the adjustment of consecutive business days and remaining business hours within a business day. The logic to calculate and adjust these values is flawed, leading to incorrect adjustments and potentially wrong output.

### Bugs
1. Incorrect handling of multiple business days adjustment
2. Inaccurate adjustment of remaining business hours within a business day

### Strategy for Fixing the Bugs
1. Revise the logic for adjusting multiple business days to ensure accurate day adjustments.
2. Refactor the logic for handling remaining business hours to correctly adjust the time within a single business day.

### Corrected Function
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = (
                        self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    )
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected function addresses the issues with adjusting multiple business days and remaining business hours within a day, ensuring the function outputs the correct adjusted datetime.
