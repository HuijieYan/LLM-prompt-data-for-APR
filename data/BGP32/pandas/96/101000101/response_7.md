## Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided code lies in the logic to adjust the datetime value based on business hours. The bug occurs when trying to adjust the time when `n < 0`. In this case, the current logic does not handle the adjustment correctly, resulting in incorrect time calculations.

When `n < 0`, the buggy function should adjust the time to the previous business day and then find the next opening time before adjusting for business hours. However, the current implementation does not reset the time correctly and does not adjust for business days properly.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the logic for adjusting the time when `n < 0` needs to be corrected. Adjusting the time to the previous business day and finding the next opening time should be done accurately. Additionally, the logic for handling business days and business hours should be reviewed and corrected to ensure proper adjustment.

## Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
from datetime import timedelta

# This is the corrected version of the buggy function
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(hour=other.hour, minute=other.minute, second=other.second, microsecond=0)
        n = self.n
        
        # Adjust other based on n value
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        while bd != 0:
            if bd < 0:
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            else:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            bd += -1 if bd < 0 else 1

        # Adjust remaining business hours
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        
        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other if n >= 0 else other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
            
            if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                other += bhour
                bhour_remain -= bhour
            else:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function should now properly adjust the datetime value based on business hours even when `n < 0`. Feel free to test this corrected version with the provided test cases to ensure the expected behavior.
