### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `apply` function arises from the incorrect handling of the `other` input parameter. When manipulating the `other` variable based on the `n` value and business hours, the function fails to account for specific cases, leading to incorrect adjustments and resulting in the wrong output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `apply` function, we need to ensure that the adjustments to the `other` variable based on the `n` value are correctly implemented. Specifically, we should pay attention to adjusting for business days and remaining business hours accurately, considering positive and negative `n` values.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                other = other + BusinessDay(n=bd)
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if n >= 0 and bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                elif n < 0 and (bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and other.nanosecond != 0)):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other) 
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1))
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function addresses the issues identified in the buggy function, ensuring that the adjustments made to the `other` variable based on the `n` value are correct for various cases.
