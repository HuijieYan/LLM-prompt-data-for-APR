### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `apply` is designed to adjust a given timestamp `other` based on a set of business hours and days defined in the `self` object. The bug occurs when attempting to adjust the timestamp based on the number of business days specified in `self.n`. The current logic fails to correctly handle scenarios where the adjustment requires moving across multiple business days.

### Bug Location
The bug is primarily located in the logic for adjusting the timestamp when the number of business days `self.n` is not zero. Specifically, the code does not correctly handle cases where the adjustment spans across multiple business days.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to revisit the logic that adjusts the timestamp based on the number of business days specified by `self.n`. We should ensure that the adjustment correctly accounts for moving across multiple business days, both forward and backward in time.

### Corrected Function
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
        
        n = self.n
        if n >= 0:
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            while not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
            
        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            other += bd * CustomBusinessDay()
        
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        
        bopen = self._next_opening_time(other)
        while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(bopen) - other if n >= 0 else bopen - other
            if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                other += bhour
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                bopen = self._next_opening_time(bopen)
            else:
                other += bhour_remain
                break
        
        return other

    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

```

This corrected version of the `apply` function ensures that the timestamp adjustment takes into account moving across multiple business days when necessary. It iteratively adjusts the timestamp based on the remaining business hours until the desired adjustment is completed.
