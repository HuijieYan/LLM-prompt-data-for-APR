### Bug Explanation
The bug lies in the adjustment of the `other` datetime object based on the business hours specified. The incorrect adjustments lead to incorrect output values, especially when dealing with negative `n` values (indicating going back in time).

In the buggy function, there are issues with properly adjusting the `other` datetime object based on the business hours and the specified start/end times. The logic for adjusting the datetime object is not handling the cases correctly, especially when the adjustment involves moving across different business days and time intervals.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for adjusting the `other` datetime based on the provided business hours. A key aspect of the fix involves correctly handling cases where we need to move across business days and between different business time intervals. We need to ensure that the adjustment accurately reflects the specified business hours and works correctly for both positive and negative values of `n`.

### Corrected Function
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import ApplyTypeError
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin:
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            other = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, other.hour, other.minute, other.second, other.microsecond)
            
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), 120)  # Assuming 120 minutes for business hours in a day
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                if bd > 0:
                    business_day = timedelta(days=1)
                else:
                    business_day = timedelta(days=-1)
                for _ in range(abs(bd)):
                    while not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                        other += business_day

            if r != 0:
                if n > 0:
                    while r > 0:
                        if other.time() == self._get_closing_time(self.start[0]):
                            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                        if r >= 60:
                            other += timedelta(hours=1)
                            r -= 60
                        else:
                            other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                            r = 0
                else:
                    while r < 0:
                        if other.time() == self._get_closing_time(self.start[0]):
                            other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                        if r <= -60:
                            other -= timedelta(hours=1)
                            r += 60
                        else:
                            other -= timedelta(minutes=-r)
                            r = 0
                    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected function aims to address the issues with adjusting the datetime object based on the provided business hours correctly. It handles both positive and negative values of `n` and ensures proper movement across different business days and time intervals.
