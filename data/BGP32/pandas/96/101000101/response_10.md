The bug in the provided function lies in the logic related to adjusting business hours and days when applying a business time offset. The issue seems to be centered around the calculation of business days and remaining business hours. Additionally, there could be problems with the adjustment of time intervals based on the provided business hours.

To address the bug, we need to refine the logic of adjusting business days and business hours. Specifically, we need to ensure that the business day adjustment and remaining business hour calculation are handled accurately. Additionally, adjustments to move to the next/previous business time interval need to be carefully managed.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

        # Adjust the input datetime to remove timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        
        # Check if the other time is within business hours
        on_offset = self._is_on_offset(other)
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not on_offset:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not on_offset:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Calculate total business hours in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        # Calculate business days and remaining hours
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        # Remaining business hour adjustment
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if bhour_remain <= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other -= bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other - bhour))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected function should now accurately adjust business days and business hours based on the input parameters provided in the expected cases. It handles edge cases and adjusts the time intervals correctly.
