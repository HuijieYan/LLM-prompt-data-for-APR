### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is supposed to adjust a given datetime value based on custom business hours. The function has conditional blocks for adjusting the datetime based on the business hours, holidays, and weekends.
  
2. The buggy function shows symptoms of potentially failing to handle the precise adjustment logic for business hours, especially in scenarios involving holidays.

3. The failing test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` aims to create a date range with a custom business hour frequency and holidays, but due to the bug in the `apply` function, it produces incorrect output entries (more than expected).

4. The error message during the failing test indicates a mismatch between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency (`CBH`). This suggests that the `apply` function is not applying the adjustments properly based on holidays and is causing the issue in generating the expected date range.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the issue and correct the bug:
1. Improve the adjustments within the `apply` function related to holidays handling.
2. Ensure the logic correctly adjusts the datetime values based on holidays and business hours.
3. Verify the adjustments for both positive and negative `n` values.
4. Refactor the adjustment logic to handle cases with holidays more precisely.
5. Test the function with various scenarios to confirm correctness.

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the adjustments made in the `apply` function for custom business hours with holidays, the fixed function should now produce the correct output for the failing test case and properly handle adjustments based on holidays.
