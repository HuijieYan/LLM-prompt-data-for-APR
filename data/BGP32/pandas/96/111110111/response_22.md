### Issues with the Buggy Function

1. The function is decorated with `@apply_wraps` which is intended to apply some wrapping but currently does not perform the intended operation.
2. The function tries to reset the timezone and nanosecond for the input `other`, which is unnecessary and can potentially lead to issues with the input datetime objects.
3. The logic for adjusting `other` based on the values of `n` and the conditions is complex and may contain errors leading to unexpected behavior.
4. The calculation of `bd` and `r` is based on some fixed values which may not be accurate for all scenarios.

### Bug Fix Strategy

1. Remove the unnecessary decoration `@apply_wraps` from the function.
2. Avoid unnecessary resetting of timezone and nanosecond for the input datetime object.
3. Simplify the logic for adjusting `other` based on `n` and the conditions to ensure correct adjustments for different scenarios.
4. Review the calculations of `bd` and `r` to make them more generic and handle various cases correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    def __init__(self, start, end):
        self.start = start
        self.end = end

    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(minutes=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            business_hours_sum = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n) * 60, business_hours_sum // 60)

            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd

            while r != 0:
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if r < bhour.total_seconds() // 60:
                        other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                        r = 0
                    else:
                        r -= bhour.total_seconds() // 60
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if r > bhour.total_seconds() // 60:
                        other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                        r = 0
                    else:
                        r -= bhour.total_seconds() // 60
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By simplifying the logic and ensuring proper adjustments, the corrected function should now handle different scenarios correctly and pass the failing test cases.
