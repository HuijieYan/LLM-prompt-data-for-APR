### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function, `apply`, is intended to adjust a given `datetime` value based on business hours and custom business-related rules.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the adjustments and calculations are made within the function.
3. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` requires the function `apply` to correctly adjust given `Timestamp` values with custom business hours and holidays.
4. The error message indicates a mismatch in the inferred frequency, possibly due to incorrect calculations within the function.
5. Expected input values, outputs, and variable states are provided for various test cases, helping us understand the correct behavior of the function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic within the `apply` function to correctly adjust the given `datetime` value based on the specified business hours, holidays, and other conditions.
2. Ensure that the adjustments for positive and negative `n` values are handled correctly, considering the start, end times, and holiday conditions.
3. Verify the calculations related to business days, remaining business hours, and adjustments are accurate to avoid mismatches in inferred frequencies.
4. Implement the necessary adjustments and corrections to ensure the function behaves as expected in all cases.

### Corrected Code:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @staticmethod
    def _truncate_date(dt):
        return datetime(
            dt.year, dt.month, dt.day, dt.hour, dt.minute, dt.second, dt.microsecond
        )

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            other = self._truncate_date(other)
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            business_hours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                if n >= 0:
                    next_open_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                else:
                    next_open_time = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1))
                    bhour = next_open_time - other
                
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other = next_open_time
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                else:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By implementing the corrected logic as presented above, the `apply` function should now adjust the given datetime values correctly based on the specified business hour parameters, including handling holidays.
