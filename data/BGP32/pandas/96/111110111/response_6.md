### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply()` is intended to adjust a given timestamp based on custom business hours, holidays, and the number of periods provided.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is checking the behavior of `pd.date_range()` with custom business hours and holidays. The test expects the generated date range to match the provided expected dates and times. However, due to the bug in the `CustomBusinessHour` class, the generated date range does not match the expected dates and times.
3. The error message indicates a `ValueError` in the `_validate_frequency` method due to the inferred frequency not conforming to the passed frequency.

### Error Cause:
The bug in the `apply()` method of the `CustomBusinessHour` class is causing the adjustment of timestamps using custom business hours and holidays to be incorrect. The logic of adjusting the timestamp with respect to the custom business hours, holidays, and the number of periods is faulty, leading to unexpected results.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the adjustments made to the timestamps within the `apply()` function are correctly handled based on the provided business hours, holidays, and period count.
2. Correctly adjust the operations that determine the new timestamps considering the start and end times of the custom business hours.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply()` method within the `CustomBusinessHour` class:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        original_other = other

        while n > 0:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            n -= 1

        while n < 0:
            if other.time() == self.start[0] or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                n += 1
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### With this correction, the `apply()` function should adjust the timestamps correctly based on the custom business hours and holidays, passing the failing test scenario.
