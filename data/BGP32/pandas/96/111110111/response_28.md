### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is not handling the business hours computation correctly when holidays are involved, leading to incorrect results while constructing the `DatetimeIndex`.
2. The buggy function attempts to adjust the provided timestamp `other` based on the defined business hours, but it fails to skip the holidays properly.
3. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is trying to create a date range with custom business hours and holidays, but the resulting `DatetimeIndex` does not match the expected values due to the bug.
4. The error message indicates a `ValueError` being raised during frequency validation, suggesting that the inferred frequency does not align with the passed frequency `CBH`.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug arises from incorrect holiday handling in the `apply` function of the `CustomBusinessHour` class, causing the misalignment of business days and periods, resulting in unexpected date ranges.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that holidays are properly accounted for in the calculation of business hours to skip them correctly.
2. Adjust the logic to handle holidays while determining the next opening time and closing time.
3. Verify the adjustment parameters for both positive and negative offsets to ensure correctness.
4. Update the function to correctly align the business hours with holidays to generate the expected `DatetimeIndex`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
from pandas import Timestamp, CustomBusinessHour
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class CustomBusinessHourWithHolidays(CustomBusinessHour):
    
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            original_other = other
            while other.strftime('%Y-%m-%d') in self.holidays:
                other += timedelta(hours=1)
                
            n = self.n
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(original_other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(hours=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(original_other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            return other
        
        else:
            raise TypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Expected Output:
The corrected function should now properly handle holidays while computing business hours and give the expected `DatetimeIndex` in the failing test scenario.
