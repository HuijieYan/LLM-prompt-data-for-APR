### Bug Fix Analysis:

#### Issues:
1. The buggy function `apply` is called in the failing test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` for CustomBusinessHour frequency. However, the implementation of `apply` does not handle holidays correctly, leading to incorrect output.
2. The use of the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency with holidays causes unexpected behavior in generating the datetime index when using the `periods` argument in the `date_range` function.
3. The buggy function doesn't adjust for holidays while calculating the datetime index, resulting in an incorrect number of periods generated in the presence of holidays.

#### Bug Cause:
The bug stems from the `apply` function not considering holidays in the calculation of the datetime index with CustomBusinessHour frequency. This leads to the unexpected dates being generated, which don't align with the expected output.

#### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `apply` function needs to be modified to account for holidays when generating the datetime index. This adjustment should ensure that the correct number of periods are generated even in the presence of holidays.

### Bug Fix for the `apply` function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import DateOffset

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        adjusted_start = self.rollback(other)
        if n < 0:
            if adjusted_start.time() == self.start[0]:
                # If the starting time is the opening time, move to the previous day
                other = adjusted_start - timedelta(seconds=1)
            else:
                other = adjusted_start

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        onsite_date = other.replace(
            hour=self.start[0].hour,
            minute=self.start[0].minute,
            second=0,
            microsecond=0
        )
        extra_periods = 0
        while True:
            onsite_date += DateOffset(hours=(1 if n >= 0 else -1))
            if self.is_on_offset(onsite_date) and onsite_date not in self.holidays:
                extra_periods += 1
                if extra_periods == abs(n):
                    break

        return onsite_date.replace(hour=other.hour, minute=other.minute, second=other.second, microsecond=other.microsecond)
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

#### Changes Made:
1. Adjusted the logic in the `apply` function to consider holidays when calculating the datetime index.
2. Used `self.rollback` to properly adjust the starting timestamp based on the CustomBusinessHour settings.
3. Calculated the number of extra periods based on the holiday and adjusted the end timestamp accordingly.

By applying these changes to the `apply` function, the issue with incorrect periods generation in the presence of holidays for CustomBusinessHour frequency should be resolved.
