### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class of the file `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` is not behaving as expected when custom business hours with holidays are used in the `pd.date_range` function.
2. The error message indicates a validation issue related to frequencies that are causing the test to fail.
3. The function is not correctly adjusting the dates based on business hours and holidays, leading to incorrect results in `pd.date_range`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the adjustments for business days and business hours within a day are correctly handled based on the custom business hours configuration.
5. Correcting the adjustments and ensuring the logic follows the expected behavior will resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        if n >= 0:
            if other.hour >= self.end[0].hour or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.hour < self.start[0].hour or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() <= 0:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the logic for adjusting dates based on business hours, correct handling of holidays, and ensuring the adjustment processes are aligned with the expected behavior of business hours, the bug should be fixed, and the test case should pass successfully.
