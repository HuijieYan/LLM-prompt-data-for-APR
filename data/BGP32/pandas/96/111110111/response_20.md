### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` is meant to adjust a datetime based on business hour offsets. It involves checking certain conditions related to the input datetime and adjusting it accordingly.
2. The bug seems related to how the adjustments are made when the number of business hours passed is negative (going back in time). This leads to unexpected results when combined with holidays, as seen in the failing test case.
3. The bug is that during the adjustment for negative business hours, the `if` condition for checking `other.time()` in self.start is missing; this check is necessary to adjust the datetime properly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to add the missing `if` condition inside the `else` block when `n < 0` to check if the time is present in `self.start`.
5. After identifying and fixing the bug, applying additional tests to ensure the corrected function works as expected.

### Bug Fix:
```python
    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:  # Added condition for self.start
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            # Rest of the function remains the same
```

After correcting the function as shown above, it's necessary to run the failing test case again to ensure the issue has been resolved.
