### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the class `BusinessHourMixin` is responsible for adjusting datetime objects based on business hours. The error message points to an issue related to the validation of frequency when using `pd.date_range` with a custom business hour frequency and holidays.

The bug causes the `pd.date_range` function to generate more periods than expected when using `pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour` with holidays specified. The issue arises from the incorrect calculation within the `apply` function.

### Bug Location:
The bug is most likely occurring in the logic related to adjusting business days and hours in the `apply` function, leading to an incorrect number of periods being generated in the `pd.date_range` function.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug results from incorrect handling of business day increments and adjustments when applying custom business hours, which leads to the unexpected increase in periods generated by `pd.date_range` when holidays are involved.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the logic within the `apply` function needs to be reviewed and potentially modified to correctly adjust the datetime objects based on the business hours and days. Special attention should be paid to the sections involving business day increments, adjustments for holidays, and calculations for the number of business hours and days.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour, CustomBusinessDay
from datetime import time, datetime, timedelta

    # Previous function definitions remain the same
    
    @apply_wraps

        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )

            # Adjust other to reduce the number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:

                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    # Business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        # Finish adjusting if possible
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        # Go to the next business time interval
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    # Business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if (
                        bhour_remain > bhour
                        or bhour_remain == bhour
                        and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0
                    ):
                        # Finish adjusting if possible
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        # Go to the next business time interval
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))
                        )

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After updating the `apply` function, the corrected logic should handle the adjustment of business hours and days correctly, ensuring that `pd.date_range` generates the expected number of periods when using custom business hours with holidays specified.
