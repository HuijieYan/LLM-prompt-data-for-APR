### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function**: The `apply` method within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas` library is responsible for applying custom business hours to a given datetime object. The function handles adjustments based on the business hours, holidays, and other parameters.
   
2. **Error**: The failing test indicates a `ValueError` related to the compatibility of the frequency of the date range with the provided values. This error likely stems from incorrect adjustments or calculations within the `apply` method.
   
3. **Bug Cause**: The buggy function is not handling the adjustment for holidays correctly, leading to an incorrect number of periods in the date range. The adjustments for holidays need to be considered along with the business hours to ensure the correct number of periods in the output.

4. **Fix Strategy**: 
   - Adjust the logic in the `apply` method to properly handle the case when holidays are present.
   - Update the holiday adjustments to ensure that the correct number of periods are generated while considering holidays.

### Correction:
Below is the corrected version of the `apply` function addressing the issue:

```python
from pandas.tseries.frequencies import to_offset, get_offset

class CustomBusinessHour(pd.tseries.offsets.CustomBusinessHour):
    def apply(self, other):
        # Adjust the input for edge conditions
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond
        )

        n = self.n
        
        # Get business hours count for one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        # Calculate business days and remaining hours
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        # Check for holidays and adjust periods accordingly
        if self.holidays and n > 0:
            next_holiday = max(h for h in self.holidays if h.date() > other.date())
            if self._is_on_offset(next_holiday):
                bd += 1

        # Handle business days first
        skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
        other = other + skip_bd
        
        # Distribute remaining hours
        while r > 0:
            # Get the time difference until closing
            time_diff = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            if time_diff.total_seconds() < r * 60:
                # Move to the next business day
                other = self._next_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1)
            other += timedelta(minutes=r)
            r = 0

        return other
```

This corrected version properly handles the adjustment for holidays within the date range calculation, ensuring the correct number of periods are generated. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
