### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is intended to adjust a given date and time based on the custom business hour offset specified in the `CustomBusinessHour` class.
2. The bug likely lies in the adjustment logic within the `apply` function, especially in handling holidays and adjusting business hours.
3. The failing test uses the `CustomBusinessHour` with holidays, and the output generated is incorrect, exceeding the expected number of periods. This implies a fault in the adjustment mechanism.
4. The error message raised during the failing test indicates a mismatch in the inferred frequency, indicating a discrepancy during the frequency validation process.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `apply` function to accurately handle the adjustment logic, particularly when holidays are involved and business hours need to be accounted for correctly.
2. Ensure that the adjustment mechanism works as expected, producing the correct output without exceeding the specified periods.
3. Validate the frequency of the adjusted date based on the custom business hour offset to avoid the discrepancy in inferred frequencies.
4. Make necessary corrections to align the adjustment logic with the intended behavior.

### Bug-fixed function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            original_other = other
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            while n != 0:
                business_hours_in_day = sum(
                    self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                    for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
                )
                business_hour_offset = datetime.timedelta(seconds=abs(n * 60 * business_hours_in_day // 60))
                if n < 0:
                    business_hour_offset *= -1

                other += business_hour_offset
                n -= 1

                if original_other.time() not in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(original_other):
                    # Adjust for holidays
                    while not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other + business_hour_offset):
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                        other += self.next_bday

                    # Deal with remaining business hours
                    remaining_bhour = datetime.timedelta(minutes=1)
                    while remaining_bhour != datetime.timedelta(0):
                        prev_opening = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                        next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
                        bhour = next_opening - other

                        if remaining_bhour < bhour:
                            other += remaining_bhour
                            remaining_bhour = datetime.timedelta(0)
                        else:
                            remaining_bhour -= bhour
                            other = self._get_closing_time(prev_opening + timedelta(days=1))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Now, the updated `apply` function should properly calculate the adjusted date and time based on the custom business hour offset, accounting for holidays and correctly handling the number of periods specified. This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
