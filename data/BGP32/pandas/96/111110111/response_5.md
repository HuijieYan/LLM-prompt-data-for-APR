## Analysis
The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is designed to handle custom business hour offsets. The issue arises due to incorrect adjustments made for business days and business hours within the function. The failing test case with custom holidays triggers the bug, resulting in incorrect datetime outputs.

## Bug Description
The bug affects the adjustment logic implemented in the `apply` function. When handling negative business hour offsets and encountering holidays, the adjustment to move to the previous business day is flawed. This flaw leads to incorrect calculations of business hours to adjust, resulting in inaccurate output datetime values.

## Bug Cause
The buggy function `apply` does not correctly handle negative business hour offsets in combination with holidays. The flawed logic does not properly adjust for the previous business day when encountering holidays, leading to incorrect datetime calculations.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the adjustment logic for negative offsets and holidays needs to be revised within the `apply` function. Correctly handling holidays and adjusting for the previous business day when necessary will ensure accurate business hour calculations and output datetime values.

## Bug-fixed Function
```python
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            other = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, other.hour, other.minute, other.second, other.microsecond)
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open - skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other if n >= 0 else other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if bhour_remain < bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other += bhour
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

Upon fixing the bug, the `apply` function should now handle negative business hour offsets correctly, adjust for holidays, and provide accurate datetime outputs as expected in the failing test cases. The adjustments made in response to negative offsets and holidays should now result in the correct business hour calculations and return values.
