### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. The bug seems to be related to the logic for adjusting the date and time when a holiday is encountered. It leads to an incorrect number of periods being generated.
2. The adjustment logic needs to be reviewed and modified to ensure the correct number of periods is generated even when holidays are involved.
3. Consider refactoring the logic for handling holidays, business hours, and adjustments to ensure the expected behavior.
4. Test thoroughly to confirm that the corrected function works as intended with and without holidays.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

```python
# Import necessary libraries (assuming they are available)
from pandas.tseries.offsets import ApplyTypeError
from datetime import datetime, time, timedelta


class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)

                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self.next_bday.rollforward(other)
                other += skip_bd  # Adjust by skipping business days
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)  # Remaining business hours to adjust
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the logic for handling holidays and business hour offsets, the corrected function aims to generate the correct number of periods even when holidays are involved. Be sure to test the corrected function against the failing test case and other relevant scenarios to ensure it works as expected.
