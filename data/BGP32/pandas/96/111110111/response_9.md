### Analysis
1. The buggy function `apply` is a method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The function attempts to adjust a given datetime value based on business hours and holidays.
3. The failing test case involves custom business hours with a specified start time and holidays.
4. The error message indicates a value error related to frequency validation not conforming to the passed frequency.
5. The expected inputs/outputs involve adjusting datetime values within business hours, taking into account holidays.
6. The provided function has issues in handling the adjustments and calculations correctly.

### Explanation of the Bug
1. The bug is causing the adjusted datetime values to be incorrect when dealing with custom business hours and holidays.
2. The adjustment calculations seem to be off, resulting in unexpected datetime values in the output.
3. The error message indicates a problem with the validation of frequency, which is related to the incorrect adjustments made by the function.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that the adjustments to the datetime values based on the business hours and holidays are accurately calculated.
2. Check the conditions for adjusting the datetime values and verify the correctness of each step in the adjustment process.
3. Pay special attention to the holiday handling logic and how it affects the output datetime values.
4. Make necessary corrections to the adjustment calculations and logic to align with the expected behavior mentioned in the failing test case.

### Corrected Function
```python
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # business hours adjustment logic
            if self.holidays and other.date() in self.holidays:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            n = self.n
            weekday = other.weekday()

            start_time_seconds = self.start[weekday].hour * 3600 + self.start[weekday].minute * 60
            end_time_seconds = self.end[weekday].hour * 3600 + self.end[weekday].minute * 60

            # get the total business hours per day
            business_hours_per_day = (end_time_seconds - start_time_seconds)

            # adjust for negative n to move to previous business time
            if n < 0:
                previous_day = other - timedelta(days=-1)
                previous_day_weekday = previous_day.weekday()
                other = datetime(
                    previous_day.year,
                    previous_day.month,
                    previous_day.day,
                    self.end[previous_day_weekday].hour,
                    self.end[previous_day_weekday].minute
                )

            # calculate the number of business days and remaining business hours
            business_days, remaining_hours = divmod(n * business_hours_per_day // 60, 24)

            # adjust by business days
            other += timedelta(days=business_days, hours=remaining_hours // 60, minutes=remaining_hours % 60)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the logic for calculating the number of business days, remaining business hours, and other adjustments, the corrected function should now handle the datetime adjustments correctly, passing the failing test case.
