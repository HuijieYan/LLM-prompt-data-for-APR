### Analysis:
1. **Bug in Code**: The issue seems to be related to the `apply` method in the `CustomBusinessHour` class. When using `pd.date_range` with periods and adding holidays, the number of returned periods is more than expected.
2. **Error Location**: The buggy code is inside the `apply` method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class.
3. **Bug Cause**: The bug is likely due to incorrect business hour adjustments and calculations when handling holidays in the `apply` method. This causes the unexpected behavior in the returned periods.
4. **Fix Strategy**: Update the logic inside the `apply` method to properly handle holidays and adjust business hours as needed.

### Correction:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` method to resolve the issue:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            if n != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=n)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self.next_bday.rollforward(other)
                    while not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other += self
    
            if n < 0:
                other -= CustomBusinessHour(1)  # Adjust for non-business hours
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Ensure that this corrected version is updated in the pandas source code at the appropriate location. This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub regarding `pd.date_range` with custom holidays.
