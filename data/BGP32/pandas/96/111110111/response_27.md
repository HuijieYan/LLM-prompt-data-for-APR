### Analysis
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is designed to adjust the timestamp based on business hours.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` uses a `CustomBusinessHour` frequency with specific holidays and periods to generate a DateTimeIndex. However, the function produces unexpected results by generating more than the specified number of periods due to the bug.
3. The error message indicates that the inferred frequency does not match the passed frequency.
4. The issue on GitHub mentions that `pd.date_range` does not work correctly when combining holidays with periods using `CustomBusinessHour`.
   
### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `apply` function is causing the adjustment of timestamps based on business hours to be incorrect, leading to unexpected results. The handling of holidays and adjustments for positive and negative business days is causing discrepancies in the timestamp generation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Adjust the logic in the `apply` function to correctly handle holidays and adjust timestamps based on business hours for positive and negative business days.
2. Ensure that the calculation of business hours and adjustments is accurately reflected in the return timestamp.

### Corrected Version
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            
            # Determine if the given timestamp falls on an offset
            is_on_offset = self.is_on_offset(other)
            
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not is_on_offset:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(minutes=1)
                if not is_on_offset:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            # Get total business hours in a day
            business_hours = sum((en - st).seconds for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
            
            # Calculate business days and remaining hours
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
            
            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                other = other + CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
            
            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = CustomBusinessHour(minutes=r)
            
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other) + CustomBusinessHour(seconds=(bhour.total_seconds()))
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    if bhour_remain > bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making adjustments to the business hour calculations and timestamp adjustments, the corrected version of the function should now generate the expected results and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
