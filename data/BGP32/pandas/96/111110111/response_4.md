### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is causing unexpected behavior when used with `CustomBusinessHour` frequency with holidays. The `apply` function is intended to adjust the input datetime within the custom business hours but is failing to do so correctly when holidays are involved. This causes incorrect periods to be returned in the `date_range` function when holidays are specified.

The issue specifically arises when adjusting the datetime based on the holiday and moving it to the next available opening time. The current logic does not handle this scenario correctly, leading to the unexpected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the logic within the `apply` function needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the adjustment based on holidays. Specifically, when checking for holidays and moving the datetime to the next available business hour after a holiday, the function should ensure that the adjustment is performed correctly while maintaining the correct number of periods in the result.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        if other in self.holidays:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function now includes proper handling of holidays to ensure that the adjustment maintains the correct number of periods while moving the datetime within the custom business hours when holidays are present.
