### Bug Analysis
1. The provided buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the offsets file.
2. The buggy function calculates the next valid business time based on the input datetime and the offset conditions.
3. The buggy function is expected to work correctly with CustomBusinessHours offset, ensuring that holidays are properly accounted for.
4. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` checks the behavior of `pd.date_range` with a CustomBusinessHour offset and holidays.
5. The error message indicates a problem with the validation of frequency, suggesting that the buggy function's output does not conform to expectations.
6. The expected input/output values are provided for multiple test cases.
7. The GitHub issue indicates that when using periods and adding holiday in `pd.date_range` with CustomBusinessHour, the behavior is unexpected.

### Bug Cause
1. The buggy function does not handle the presence of holidays correctly when adjusting the dates based on the business hours offset.
2. This leads to incorrect results when holidays are introduced, causing the failing test to identify the discrepancy.
3. The error message arises from a validation check that fails due to the unexpected datetime values generated by the buggy function.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the logic in the `apply` function to correctly adjust the datetime values when holidays are present.
2. Ensure that the calculations consider holidays and adjust the dates accordingly to align with the expected business hours.
3. Test the modified function against the provided test cases to verify that the corrections address the issue.

### Corrected Function
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour, CustomBusinessDay
from datetime import timedelta

# This will be placed in the corresponding offsets file after bug fix
class CustomBusinessHour(CustomBusinessHour):

    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, (datetime, Timestamp)):
            n = self.n
            if n > 0:
                offset = CustomBusinessHour(self.start, end=self.end, holidays=self.holidays, weekmask=self.weekmask)
            else:
                offset = CustomBusinessHour(self.start, end=self.end, holidays=self.holidays, weekmask=self.weekmask)
            
            res = super().apply(other)
            
            if 'freq' in other.fields and other.freq is not None:
                offset.n = n + 1
            else:
                offset.n = 1

            for _ in range(abs(n) - 1):
                prev_res = offset.apply(res)
                if n > 0:
                    if prev_res.time() not in offset.start or offset._is_on_offset(prev_res):
                        res = prev_res
                    else:
                        res = offset._next_opening_time(prev_res)
                else:
                    if prev_res.time() in offset.end and not offset._is_on_offset(prev_res):
                        res = prev_res
                    else:
                        res = offset._prev_opening_time(prev_res)
            
            return res
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After fixing the bug and updating the CustomBusinessHour class, the function should be tested with the provided test cases to ensure that the issue reported on GitHub is resolved.
