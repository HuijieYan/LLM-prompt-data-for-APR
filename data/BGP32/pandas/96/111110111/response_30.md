### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is responsible for handling custom business hours and adjusting timestamps accordingly.
2. The test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is designed to create a date range with custom business hours including holidays and assert the expected values against the result.
3. The error message `ValueError: Inferred frequency None from passed values does not conform to passed frequency CBH` indicates an issue related to the frequency validation of the date range with custom business hours and holidays.
4. The bug causes the `pd.date_range` function to produce unexpected results when using periods and adding holidays together in specific scenarios.
5. The GitHub issue highlights the problem with the date range creation function causing more periods than expected when holidays are added.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the improper handling of dates and holidays within the business hour adjustment logic in the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustment and validation logic in the `apply` function correctly handles holidays and the generation of the date range with custom business hours.

### Corrected Function:
```python
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Prepare other timestamp for adjustments
            other = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, other.hour, other.minute, other.second, other.microsecond)
            n = self.n

            # Adjust the timestamp based on business hours and holidays
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other) or other in self.holidays:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start or other in self.holidays:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # Calculate total business hours in one business day
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd, holidays=self.holidays)
                other = other + skip_bd

            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            # Adjust the timestamp by business hours
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other if n >= 0 else self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                # Move to the next business time interval
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By updating the `apply` function with the corrected logic for handling holidays and date adjustments, we can resolve the unexpected behavior causing the test case failure and the GitHub issue reported.
