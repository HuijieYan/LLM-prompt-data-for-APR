### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is supposed to adjust a given datetime object based on custom business hours. The function is assuming a specific business hour structure (start and end times) to apply the adjustments.
2. The failing test is trying to create a DatetimeIndex with custom business hours including a holiday on '2020-11-26'. The test case fails due to incorrect handling of holidays within business hours, leading to unexpected behavior in the generated DatetimeIndex.
3. The error message implies a validation issue with the frequency generation.
4. To fix the bug, the function needs to properly account for holidays while adjusting the datetime object based on custom business hours.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that holidays are appropriately considered when determining the adjusted time based on custom business hours.
2. Adjust the logic in the `apply` function to handle holidays and weekday calculations correctly.
3. Update the return statement to provide the adjusted datetime object as expected.

### Bug Fix - Corrected Version:
```python
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    while other in self.holidays:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start or other in self.holidays:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = (
                        self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    )
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(
                                other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                            )
                        )

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By updating the logic to handle holidays appropriately within the custom business hours adjustment, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
