### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is designed to adjust a given `datetime` object to the next or previous business hour based on the defined business hours. However, the function contains several logic errors that prevent it from correctly handling the given input parameters. 

Upon analysis, the potential error locations within the function include:
1. Incorrect adjustment of the `other` datetime object to remove timezone and nanosecond information.
2. Incorrect handling of negative business hours.
3. Incorrect adjustment of the business days.
4. Incorrect calculation and adjustment of remaining business hours.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect logic used in handling adjustments for positive and negative business hours, leading to inaccurate calculations of the adjusted datetime object. Additionally, the function fails to properly adjust the business days and remaining business hours, resulting in incorrect output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `apply` function, the following actions can be taken:
1. Correctly adjust the input `other` datetime object without resetting timezone information.
2. Properly handle positive and negative business hours adjustments to ensure accurate adjustments.
3. Correctly adjust the business days and remaining business hours to obtain the desired output.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            business_start = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, self.start[0].hour, self.start[0].minute)
            business_end = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, self.end[0].hour, self.end[0].minute)
            
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() >= business_end.time() or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() < business_start.time():
                    other = other.replace(hour=business_end.hour, minute=business_end.minute) - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            while n > 0:
                other += timedelta(minutes=60)  # Move to the next hour
                if self._is_on_offset(other):
                    n -= 1
            
            while n < 0:
                other -= timedelta(minutes=60)  # Move to the previous hour
                if self._is_on_offset(other): 
                    n += 1
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By implementing the suggested corrections in the `apply` function, it should now correctly adjust the given datetime object based on the defined business hours. This updated version should pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output values.
