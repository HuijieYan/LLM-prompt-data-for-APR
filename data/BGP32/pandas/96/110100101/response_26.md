### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `apply` is supposed to adjust the input datetime based on the business hour specified by the `self` CustomBusinessHour object. However, there are several issues in the logic of the function that lead to incorrect adjustments and, ultimately, incorrect output.

1. The function does not properly handle cases where the input datetime is on the edge of the business hour interval.
2. The calculation for adjusting remaining business hours is not correct in some scenarios.
3. The adjustment for moving to the next or previous business day is not consistent and may lead to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `apply` function, the following changes need to be made:
1. Ensure that edge cases are correctly handled when the input datetime is on the edge of the business hour interval.
2. Correct the logic for adjusting remaining business hours to accurately reflect the time difference.
3. Ensure consistency in moving to the next or previous business day based on the business hour interval.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            
            n = self.n
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() not in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
            
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
            
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    if n >= 0:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                    else:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making these corrections, the function should now accurately adjust the input datetime based on the specified CustomBusinessHour object and pass the failing test case provided.
