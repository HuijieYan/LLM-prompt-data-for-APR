### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `apply` function arises from incorrect handling of negative business hours in the logic for adjusting the time. When `self.n` (number of business hours) is negative, the function fails to correctly adjust the time for previous business days and remaining business hours. This results in incorrect outputs for cases where `self.n` is negative.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to properly adjust the time for negative business hours in the `apply` function. This involves ensuring that the time is adjusted correctly for both positive and negative values of `self.n`, taking into account the specific conditions for each case.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` Function
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function that addresses the bug:

```python
# Updated apply function with bug fixed
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if self.n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(self.n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if self.n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
            if self.n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                
            if self.n >= 0 or (bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0)):
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version ensures that the time adjustment is correctly handled for both positive and negative values of `self.n`. It addresses the bug by properly adjusting the time based on the specified conditions in each case.
