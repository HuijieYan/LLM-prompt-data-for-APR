### Strategy for fixing the bug:
The bug seems to be related to the logic around adjusting the datetime based on business hours. It is likely that the calculations for adjusting the business hours are not correctly handling the edge cases or the negative values of `n`, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the logic for adjusting the business hours considering both positive and negative values of `n`. Additionally, we should ensure that the calculations are accurate when determining the next opening time, closing time, and the remaining business hours.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n) * 60, businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = self.next_bday.apply(other)

            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        break
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other) + timedelta(seconds=1)
            else:
                while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                    bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other -= bhour_remain
                        break
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function should address the issues related to adjusting the datetime based on business hours and should produce the expected output for the provided test cases.
