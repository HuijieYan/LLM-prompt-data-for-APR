### Analysis
The buggy function is meant to adjust a given datetime object based on custom business hours specified by the `CustomBusinessHour` class. However, there are several issues in the implementation leading to incorrect adjustments and failing the test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.

### Issues
1. The condition for adjusting when `n >= 0` is incorrect.
2. Incorrect handling of adjustments when `n < 0`.
3. Incorrect calculation of `bd` and `r`.
4. Inconsistencies in adjusting business hours.
5. Using the `self.next_bday` attribute instead of `skip_bd`.
6. Incorrect handling of the remaining business hours in each interval.

To fix the issues, we need to:
1. Correctly adjust the date based on `n` and the custom business hours.
2. Calculate the number of business days and remaining hours (`bd` and `r`) accurately.
3. Adjust the date considering the business hours correctly.
4. Use the `skip_bd` variable for adjustments to the previous business day.
5. Properly adjust the remaining business hours within each business time interval.

### Solution
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, businesshours - r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            other += skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
            else:
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                break
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(self._get_closing_time(other))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version addresses the issues mentioned above and should now pass the failing test case provided.
