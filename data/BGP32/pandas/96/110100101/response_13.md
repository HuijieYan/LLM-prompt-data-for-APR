### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `apply` is not correctly handling adjustments for business hours. It fails to correctly calculate the remaining business hours to adjust and does not properly adjust the input timestamp `other` based on the business day and remaining business hours.

### Bug Location
The bug is likely located in the logic that calculates and adjusts the remaining business hours (`bhour_remain`) in each business time interval.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly calculate and adjust the remaining business hours `bhour_remain` in each business time interval based on the input parameters and the offset business hours defined in the `CustomBusinessHour` instance. The adjustment logic needs to consider the direction of adjustment (positive or negative `n`) and properly handle moving between business time intervals.

### Corrected Function
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other to reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0)
    
            # calculate start and end times for business hours
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            # calculate business days and remaining business hours to adjust
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = other + skip_bd
    
            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
    
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    if n >= 0:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                    else:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

This corrected function calculates the remaining business hours correctly and correctly adjusts the input timestamp `other` based on the defined business hours and the direction of adjustment.
