### Strategy for fixing the bug:
The bug seems to be related to the adjustment of business hours in the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. It appears that the function is not correctly handling the adjustment of business days and business hours, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to carefully review the adjustment logic and ensure that it accurately adjusts the `other` datetime variable based on the specified business hours and days. Additionally, we need to correctly handle edge cases and consider the presence of holidays when making adjustments.

Based on the failing test cases provided, we can see that the bug is likely related to the incorrect adjustment of business days and business hours, leading to off-by-one errors or incorrect time calculations. By carefully reviewing and updating the adjustment logic, we can ensure that the function produces the correct results for the given input parameters.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
# The corrected apply function with fixed bug
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        original_time = other.time()
        same_time = False
        
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        while True:
            new_time = other.time()
            if new_time == original_time:
                same_time = True

            if n >= 0 and (same_time or not self._is_on_offset(other) or new_time in self.end):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            elif n < 0 and (new_time in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other)):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

            business_hours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    closing_time = self._get_closing_time(other)
                    next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    bhour = closing_time - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other = next_opening
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                    else:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    bhour = next_opening - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and other.nanosecond != 0):
                        other = next_opening
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                    else:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

            return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making the adjustments as outlined above, the corrected version of the `apply` function should now be able to handle the given test cases and produce the expected results for the specified input parameters.
