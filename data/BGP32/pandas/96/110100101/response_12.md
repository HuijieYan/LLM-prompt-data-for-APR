### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is intended to adjust a given timestamp based on business hours.
2. The function contains multiple conditions for adjusting the timestamp, including business days and remaining business hours.
3. The bug seems to be related to the calculation and adjustment of business hours within a day, leading to incorrect outputs.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustment of business hours and days within the function is correctly implemented.
   
### Bug:
The bug in the `apply` function leads to incorrect adjustments of the timestamp based on business hours, resulting in wrong outputs. The calculations for business days and remaining business hours within a day are not handled properly, causing the timestamps to deviate from the expected values.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, the calculation and adjustment logic for business hours and days need to be revised. The adjustment of the timestamp within business hours and days should be accurately performed to align with the expected values.

### Corrected Version:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            if n >= 0:
                return self._apply_forward(other, n)
            else:
                return self._apply_backward(other, n)
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
    
    def _apply_forward(self, other, n):
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            other = self.next_bday.rollforward(other)
        
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                break
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        
        return other
    
    def _apply_backward(self, other, n):
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            other = self.next_bday.rollback(other)
        
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
            if bhour_remain > bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                break
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
        
        return other
``` 

This corrected version separates the functionality of adjusting forward and backward in time based on business hours, ensuring that the calculations for business days and remaining business hours are correctly implemented. It should now pass the failing test cases and produce the expected outputs.
