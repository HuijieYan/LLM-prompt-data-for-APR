### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is not correctly handling the adjustment of business days and business hours when calculating the new datetime based on the input datetime and the business hour offset. The logic for adjusting the business days and remaining business hours is not functioning as intended, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Location:
The bug is likely located in the sections of code that handle the adjustment of business days and remaining business hours. Specifically, the logic within the `if bd != 0` block for adjusting business days and the while loops for adjusting remaining business hours seem to be causing the issue.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug seems to be related to incorrect calculations and adjustments within the if-else blocks for handling the business days and remaining hours. This is leading to incorrect adjustments and ultimately returning the wrong datetime value.

### Suggested Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours in the `apply` function. Ensure that the calculations for moving to the next business day and adjusting the remaining hours are correct and accurately reflect the desired behavior.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                year=other.year,
                month=other.month,
                day=other.day,
                hour=other.hour,
                minute=other.minute,
                second=other.second,
                microsecond=other.microsecond
            )
            n = self.n

            # Adjust other based on the offset
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            # Get total business hours in a day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(start, end)
                for start, end in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = self._next_opening_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))
                other += skip_bd

            # Adjust remaining business hours
            if n >= 0:
                while r > 0:
                    next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    bhour = next_opening - other
                    if r >= bhour.seconds // 60:
                        other = next_opening
                        r -= bhour.seconds // 60
                    else:
                        other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                        break
            else:
                while r < 0:
                    prev_opening = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    bhour = other - prev_opening
                    if abs(r) >= bhour.seconds // 60:
                        other = prev_opening
                        r += bhour.seconds // 60
                    else:
                        other -= timedelta(minutes=abs(r))
                        break

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By updating the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours, the corrected function should now produce the expected output for the given test cases.
