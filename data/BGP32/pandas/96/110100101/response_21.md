### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is intended to adjust a datetime object based on business hours defined by the start and end times of a business day. However, there are issues with the adjustments made in the function, leading to incorrect datetime outputs.

#### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect adjustments within the function.
2. Calculation errors related to business hours and business days.
3. Incorrect handling of holidays and weekends.

### Bug Explanation:
The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` creates a `CustomBusinessHour` object with start time at 15:00 and a holiday on 2020-11-26. It then creates a date range starting on 2020-11-25 at 15:00 with a frequency of the custom business hour. The expected output contains timestamps for the specified dates and times, adjusted based on the custom business hours.

The buggy function fails to correctly adjust the datetime values within the business hours, leading to incorrect output timestamps in the test case.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to review and correct the adjustment logic in the `apply` function. Ensure that the adjustments are made based on the defined business hours, taking into account holidays and weekends as specified in the input parameters.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            if n > 0:
                while self._get_business_hours_by_sec(other.time()) == 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                while self._get_business_hours_by_sec(other.time()) == 0:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1)
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function should now adjust the datetime object according to the defined business hours, avoiding the previous bugs.
