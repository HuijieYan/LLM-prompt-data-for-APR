### Analysis
The buggy function is the `apply` method inside the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The function is designed to adjust a given datetime value according to business hours. However, there are issues with the logic inside the function leading to incorrect adjustments.

The potential error locations include the adjustment of the input `datetime` value based on business hours, business day skipping, and the calculation of remaining business hours.

### Bug Explanation
The buggy function fails to properly adjust the given datetime values according to business hours and business days. This results in incorrect adjustments and output dates that do not align with the expected business hours. 

One specific issue is the incorrect handling of the `businesshours` calculation and the adjustment logic based on the remaining business hours. These errors cause the function to produce incorrect output dates in some scenarios.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to correct the calculation of business hours and how they are used to adjust the input datetime values. Additionally, the logic for skipping business days and calculating remaining business hours needs to be adjusted to ensure correct adjustment of datetime values according to business hours.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
Here is a corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        if n >= 0:
            while n > 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                n -= 1
        else:
            while n < 0:
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                n += 1

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version modifies the adjustment logic to ensure that the input `datetime` value is adjusted correctly according to business hours. Additionally, it simplifies the logic to handle positive and negative adjustments based on the value of `self.n`.
