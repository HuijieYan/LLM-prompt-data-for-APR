### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `apply()` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is designed to adjust a given `datetime` object based on business hours defined by the `CustomBusinessHour` object. The bug seems to be causing incorrect adjustments to the input `datetime` object, leading to unexpected output. The issue might be related to the logic used for adjusting the business hours and handling edge cases.

### Bug Cause
The bug seems to be caused by incorrect logic in handling adjustments for positive and negative values of `n` (the number of business hours to adjust). The incorrect timing calculation inside the while loops might be leading to the unexpected output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `apply()` function, we need to revisit the logic for adjusting the business hours. Specifically, we need to ensure that the adjustments for positive and negative values of `n` are handled correctly. Additionally, we should pay close attention to edge cases like the end of business hours, weekends, holidays, etc., to ensure the correct adjustment of the input `datetime` object.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `apply()` function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # adjust based on the sign of n for different scenarios
        if n >= 0:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other) if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other) else other
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        while n != 0:
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n > 0:
                bd, r = bd, r
            else:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other = self._next_opening_time(prev_open + timedelta(days=1)) + timedelta(minutes=r)
            else:
                other += skip_bd + timedelta(minutes=r)

            n = 0

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version revises the adjustment logic inside the function to handle positive and negative values of `n` correctly and ensure the correct adjustment of the input `datetime` object based on business hours.
