### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is supposed to adjust a given datetime object based on business hours defined by the class. The function seems to have issues with properly adjusting the datetime object according to business hour constraints.

### Bug Identification:
The bug in the function might be related to the logic for adjusting the datetime object to the next opening/closing time based on the business hours. The function is not handling negative values of `self.n` correctly, and there might be issues with computing the correct business hours for adjustment.

### Bug Explanation:
The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` creates a `CustomBusinessHour` object with specific starting time and holidays. It then generates a date range with custom frequencies and checks if the result matches the expected output. The bug in the `apply` function is causing incorrect adjustments to the datetime object, leading to mismatched results with the expected output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `apply` function, we need to adjust the logic for handling negative values of `self.n` properly and ensure that the datetime object is adjusted correctly based on business hours. We should also verify the conditions for moving to the next opening/closing time and ensure that the adjustments are accurate.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                while n > 0:
                    if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    n -= 1
            else:
                while n < 0:
                    if other.time() in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    n += 1
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should address the issues with adjusting the datetime object according to business hours.

Feel free to integrate this corrected version into the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file to resolve the bug.
