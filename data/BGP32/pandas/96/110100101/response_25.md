### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is meant to apply the business hour offset to a given datetime value. However, there are several issues in the implementation that cause the function to fail in the provided test case. 

1. There are inconsistencies in handling datetime objects that sometimes result in unwanted changes to the input datetime.
2. Incorrect business day adjustments are being made, leading to incorrect output.
3. There are mistakes in the handling of business hours and working days, leading to incorrect calculations and offset applications.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bugs in the `apply` function, we need to:
1. Ensure that datetime objects are handled consistently without unnecessary modifications.
2. Correctly adjust the business days and account for offset calculations.
3. Rectify the logic for adjusting business hours within the given business time intervals.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)))
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    # go to next business time interval
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain < timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0):
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    # go to next business time interval
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By applying the suggested fixes and corrections to the `apply` function, the issues causing the failing test case should be resolved, and the function should now produce the expected output for the provided test.
