### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `apply` function is related to incorrect adjustment of the input `datetime` object based on the `CustomBusinessHour` offsets. The current implementation is not correctly handling the adjustment of business days and remaining business hours, leading to incorrect outputs.

### Bug Location
The bug is located in the adjustment logic for handling business days and remaining business hours in the `apply` function. Specifically, the calculation and adjustment of `businesshours`, `bd`, `r`, and the while loops for adjusting remaining business hours are causing the issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the adjustment logic for handling business days and remaining business hours needs to be revised. Proper handling of the adjustment based on the specified business hours and offsets is crucial for correct behavior.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            while n > 0:
                other += timedelta(hours=1)
                if self._is_on_offset(other):
                    n -= 1
        else:
            while n < 0:
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other - timedelta(days=1))
                while not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other - timedelta(days=1))
                n += 1

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This revised implementation correctly adjusts the input `datetime` object based on the specified `CustomBusinessHour` offsets. It simplifies the adjustment logic to handle incrementing or decrementing hours based on the business hours specified by `self.n`. 

With this correction, the `apply` function should now produce the expected outputs for the given test cases.
