### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is designed to adjust a given timestamp based on business hours. However, there are several issues causing the function to fail:
1. Inconsistent handling of `other` parameter: The function inconsistently handles the `other` parameter, sometimes converting it to a `datetime` object and sometimes keeping it as is. This inconsistency leads to unexpected behavior.
2. Incorrect adjustment of business hours: The function does not properly adjust business hours, leading to incorrect results for cases where the adjustment is needed.
3. Incorrect handling of negative business hours: The function does not handle negative business hours properly, resulting in incorrect adjustments.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the `other` parameter is consistently handled throughout the function by converting it to a `datetime` object at the beginning and using that object for all calculations.
2. Update the logic for adjusting business hours to correctly account for positive and negative business hour values.
3. Refactor the code to improve readability and maintainability.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        n = self.n
        
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        if bd != 0:
            # Adjust by business days first
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying these fixes, the `apply` function should correctly adjust the timestamp based on business hours, passing all the provided test cases.
