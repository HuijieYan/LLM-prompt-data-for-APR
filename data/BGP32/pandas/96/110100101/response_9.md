### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `apply` function arises from incorrect handling of the next business day logic when adjusting the time based on the business hours specified. This leads to incorrect adjustments causing the failing test scenario.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the logic for adjusting to the next business day, particularly when the number of business days to skip is negative, is correctly implemented. Additionally, we should ensure that the adjustments based on business hours are accurately calculated.

### Corrected Function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
