### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is supposed to adjust a given datetime based on business hours. However, there are multiple issues in the implementation leading to incorrect adjustments.

1. In the if-else block where the adjustment is made, the code has incorrect logic for adjusting timestamps when `n` is negative.
2. The calculation of business hours in a day is also incorrect, leading to incorrect adjustments based on this calculation.
3. The loop conditions and adjustments within the while loops are not accurate, which leads to incorrect final timestamps.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Correct the adjustment logic for negative `n` values in the if-else block.
2. Fix the calculation of business hours in a day to accurately determine adjustments.
3. Update the while loop conditions and adjustments inside the loops to correctly adjust the timestamps.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            if self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = apply_index_wraps(other, self.weekmask, self.holidays, self.prefix, self.after)
                n = self.n
                if n >= 0:
                    if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    if other.time() == self.start[0]:
                        other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                    if self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
    
                businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
    
                bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
                if n < 0:
                    bd, r = -bd, -r
    
                if bd != 0:
                    skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                    if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                        prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                        remain = other - prev_open
                        other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                    else:
                        other = other + skip_bd
    
                bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    if n >= 0:
                        bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    else:
                        bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and other.nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        if n >= 0:
                            other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                        else:
                            other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
    
                return other
            else:
                raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making these corrections, the function should now accurately adjust the given datetime based on business hours and pass the failing test cases.
