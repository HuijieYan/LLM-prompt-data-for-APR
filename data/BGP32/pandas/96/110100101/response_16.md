### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class has issues related to adjusting the datetime based on business hours. The function is trying to handle cases where the input datetime needs to be adjusted based on business hours, but there are several logical errors leading to incorrect adjustments.

The test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is failing due to incorrect adjustments in the `apply` function when calculating business hours. The expected outcome of the test is not being met due to improper handling of business hour adjustments.

### Bug:
The main cause of the bug seems to be related to how the function handles the adjustment of datetime values based on business hours. The logic inside the loops for adjusting remaining business hours is faulty and is not correctly calculating the new datetime values.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for adjusting the datetime based on business hours. We should ensure that the adjustments are correctly calculated and applied to the input datetime. This may involve revisiting the logic inside the loops for adjusting remaining business hours and making sure the calculations are accurate.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            adjusted_datetime = other
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                adjusted_datetime = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_datetime)
                if not self._is_on_offset(adjusted_datetime):
                    adjusted_datetime = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_datetime)
                    adjusted_datetime = self._get_closing_time(adjusted_datetime)

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_datetime)) - adjusted_datetime
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_datetime) - adjusted_datetime

                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    adjusted_datetime += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    adjusted_datetime += bhour
                    bhour_remain -= bhour

            return adjusted_datetime
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function should address the issues with incorrect adjustments and should now pass the failing test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.
