### Analysis:
- The buggy function `apply` is meant to adjust a given datetime based on business hours.
- The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is expecting specific output datetime values after adjustments using a custom business hour frequency.
- The buggy function seems to have logic errors related to adjusting business hours and handling edge cases.

### Bug:
- The bug seems to be in the logic of adjusting business hours and handling cases when the adjustment goes beyond the current business day boundaries or involves holidays.

### Fix Strategy:
- Update the logic to accurately handle adjustments within business hours, taking into account edge cases like exceeding business day boundaries or encounters with holidays.
- Ensure that all variables and conditions are properly checked and handled to meet the expected output.

### Updated Function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            
            # Adjust to reduced cases to handle
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
    
            if n >= 0:
                if self._is_on_offset(other) and other.time() not in self.end:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            business_hours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = (
                    self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                )
                if n >= 0:
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(
                                other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                            )
                        )
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
With the updates, the function should handle business hour adjustments correctly, considering various edge cases, and pass the failing test cases.
