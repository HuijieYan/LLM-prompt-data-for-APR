### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is designed to adjust a given `datetime` object based on business hours. The function has several issues that are causing it to fail the test. 

1. The function is unable to correctly handle the case where the provided `datetime` value falls on the starting time of the business hours.
2. Incorrect adjustment logic leads to the wrong calculation of business days and remaining business hours to be adjusted.
3. Inconsistent handling of different scenarios for adjusting business hours.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `apply` function, we need to:
1. Correctly handle the case when the input `datetime` falls on the start time boundary of the business hours.
2. Revise the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours.
3. Simplify and make the adjustment logic consistent for both positive and negative business hour offsets.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        start_time = self.start[0]
        end_time = self.end[0]

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() == start_time and not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            while n > 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                n -= 1
        else:
            if other.time() == start_time:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1) # move to the previous day
            while n < 0:
                if other.time() == end_time and not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                n += 1

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With this corrected implementation, the `apply` function should now correctly adjust the input `datetime` object based on the business hour offset.
