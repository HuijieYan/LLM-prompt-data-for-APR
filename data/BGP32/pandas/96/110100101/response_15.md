### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class has a bug that causes incorrect adjustments in the calculation of business hours. It fails to correctly handle the adjustment of business days and the remaining business hours. This results in incorrect output datetime values compared to the expected ones.

The bug can be observed in the incorrect calculation of `bd` (business days to adjust) and `bhour_remain` (remaining business hours to adjust) variables. These calculations are crucial for adjusting the input datetime based on business hours.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to correct the calculation of `bd` and `bhour_remain` and ensure proper adjustment of business days and business hours within the `while` loops for both positive and negative values of `self.n`.

1. Fix the calculation of `bd` and `bhour_remain` based on the absolute value of `n`.
2. Adjust business days first if `bd` is not zero.
3. Update the remaining business hours to adjust based on the calculated minutes value `r`.
4. Properly adjust the input datetime based on remaining business hours in the `while` loops.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        
        n = self.n

        # Adjust the input datetime based on business hours
        if n >= 0:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            other = self._prev_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1)

        # Get total business hours by seconds in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = other + skip_bd

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        # Adjust remaining business hours
        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
            if n >= 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
            else:
                other = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1))
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)

            # Finish adjusting if possible
            if bhour_remain.total_seconds() >= bhour.total_seconds():
                other = other + bhour
                bhour_remain -= bhour
            else:
                other = other + bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the calculation of business days and remaining hours based on the absolute value of `n`, and appropriately adjusting the input datetime within the loops, we can fix the bug in the `apply` function. This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and produce the expected output datetime values.
