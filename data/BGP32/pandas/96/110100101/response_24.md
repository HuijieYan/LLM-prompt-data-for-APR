### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function is supposed to adjust a given timestamp based on business hours and holidays. However, the bug causes incorrect adjustments to be made, leading to incorrect outputs compared to the expected values in the test cases.

The bug is likely in the section where the function is incrementing or decrementing the timestamp based on business days and business hours. The logic within the while loops that adjust the timestamp based on business hours does not seem to be correctly handling the cases where the remaining business hours are less than the time interval.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic inside the while loops that adjust the timestamp based on business hours. We need to ensure that the adjustments are made correctly while considering the remaining business hours and moving to the next business time interval when necessary.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        
        n = self.n
        other = other.replace(second=0, microsecond=0)  # Reset seconds and microseconds
        
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd
        
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        
        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

By implementing these corrections to the logic inside the while loops that adjust the timestamp based on business hours, the function should now correctly adjust the timestamp according to the business hours and holidays, allowing it to pass the provided failing test.
