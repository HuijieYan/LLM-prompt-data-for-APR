## Analysis
The buggy function is the `apply` method in the `BusinessHourMixin` class of the `pandas` library's `offsets.py` file. This function is used to apply business hours to a given datetime input. The function contains several conditional statements and calculations to adjust the input datetime based on the business hours specified.

The failing test case involves using a custom business hour with a holiday, where the expected output should be a datetime index with specified periods. However, the actual output is different due to the buggy behavior of the `apply` function.

The relevant variables and calculations in the buggy function include adjusting the input datetime for holidays, business hours, and business days, which seem to be causing the issue in handling the holiday properly.

## Bug Explanation
The bug seems to stem from incorrect handling of holidays within the `apply` function. When a holiday is present, the adjustment of the input datetime to the next opening time may not correctly account for the presence of a holiday. This results in the function producing unexpected output, especially when used in conjunction with the `date_range` function.

The issue becomes evident when the function is expected to return datetime indices based on specified periods while considering the custom business hours and holidays. The failing test case highlights this discrepancy in the output datetime index when specifying periods with a holiday.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `apply` function needs to be adjusted to handle holidays properly, particularly when calculating the next opening time. The adjustment process should account for holidays and skip them accordingly. By ensuring that the function correctly adjusts the datetime based on business hours and holidays, the function should return the expected results for datetime indexing with custom business hours and holidays.

In addition to addressing the holiday handling, it is essential to ensure that the logic for business hours adjustment within the function is accurate to produce the desired output.

## Bug Fix and Corrected Version
Based on the analysis and bug explanations provided, below is the corrected version of the `apply` function from the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `offsets.py` file in the `pandas` library:

```python
from pandas.errors import ApplyTypeError

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, (datetime, pd.Timestamp)):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if not self._is_on_offset(other) or other.hour >= self.end[0].hour:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.hour in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(hours=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd, holidays=self.holidays)
            if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
            if n >= 0:
                next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
                bhour = next_opening - other
            else:
                closing_time = self._get_closing_time(other)
                bhour = closing_time - other

            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(next_opening)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(closing_time - timedelta(1))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function aims to address the handling of holidays more effectively and adjust the datetime according to business hours to provide the expected output, especially when used in scenarios like the failing test case involving `date_range` with custom business hours and holidays.
