## Analyzing the Bug

### Problem:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is causing unexpected behavior when generating date ranges with custom business hours and holidays. The function is intended to adjust a given datetime object based on custom business hours, but it fails in certain scenarios when holidays are involved.

### Bugs:
1. The `apply` function fails to correctly adjust the datetime object for the next opening time and closing time when holidays are present.
2. The function generates more periods than expected when holiday adjustments are made.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The adjustment logic for handling holidays within the `self.n < 0` branch.
2. Incorrect calculations for adjusting business days and remaining business hours.

### Cause of the Bug - Using Provided Test Function:
The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` specifies a `CustomBusinessHour` with a start time of "15:00" and a holiday on "2020-11-26". However, the buggy function does not handle holidays correctly, resulting in the unexpected behavior displayed in the error message.

### Expected Input/Output Values:
The corrected function should adjust the given datetime object according to the specified custom business hours, handle holidays correctly, and generate the expected date ranges without exceeding the specified periods.

## Fixing the Bug

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic for adjusting the datetime object when holidays are present within the `_is_on_offset` check.
2. Ensure correct calculations for adjusting business days and remaining business hours.

### Bug Fix Implementation:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy apply function
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # Adjust for holidays
        if other.strftime('%Y-%m-%d') in self.holidays:
            if n >= 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Regular adjustment with business hours
        while n != 0:
            if n > 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # Move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

            n = n - 1

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By implementing this corrected version of the `apply` function, the issues related to holiday adjustments and unexpected date range generation should be resolved.

This correction should now pass the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` and generate the expected date ranges without exceeding the specified periods.

Ensure to conduct further testing to validate the functionality before merging the fix.
