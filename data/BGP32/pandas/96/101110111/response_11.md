Based on the analysis provided, the issue lies within the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `offsets.py` file. The function is responsible for applying business hours based on specific conditions, but it seems to have a bug that causes unexpected behavior when working with holidays in the `date_range` function.

The bug appears to be related to how the function handles adjustments for holidays, which leads to incorrect results in certain scenarios. The failing test case demonstrates an example where using holidays causes the function to produce more periods than expected in the `date_range` function.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the adjustment for holidays is correctly handled to avoid such issues with the `date_range` function. By updating the logic within the `apply` function to account for holidays properly, we can address the problem and ensure that the function behaves as intended.

Below is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            if self.weekmask[other.weekday()] == "1" and other.date() not in self.holidays:
                n = self.n

                # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
                if n >= 0:
                    if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    if other.time() in self.start:
                        # adjustment to move to previous business day
                        other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                    if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                        other = self._get_closing_time(other)

                # get total business hours by sec in one business day
                businesshours = sum(
                    self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                    for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
                )

                bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
                if n < 0:
                    bd, r = -bd, -r

                # adjust by business days first
                if bd != 0:
                    skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                    other = other + skip_bd

                # remaining business hours to adjust
                bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

                if n >= 0:
                    while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                        bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                        if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                            bhour_remain -= bhour
                        else:
                            other += bhour_remain
                            bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                        bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                        if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                            other = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))
                            bhour_remain -= bhour
                        else:
                            other -= bhour_remain
                            bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

                return other
            else:
                raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With this correction, the `apply` function should now handle holidays correctly and produce the expected results when used in conjunction with the `date_range` function, as shown in the failing test case provided.
