## Analysis
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class, inheriting from `BusinessMixin`. It applies a custom business hour offset to a given datetime object.
2. The function mistakenly handles the adjustment of business days and business hours, leading to unexpected results when combining with the custom holiday logic.
3. The failing test case involves creating a date range using custom business hours with a specified start time and holidays. The test fails due to a discrepancy between the expected and actual output DateIndices.
4. The cause of the bug lies in the incorrect calculation and adjustment of business days and hours in the `apply` function. This causes unexpected shifts in the calculated date ranges.
5. To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting business days and hours needs to be corrected to ensure the accurate application of the custom business hour offset.

## Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class:
```python
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            
            n = self.n
            start = self.start[0]
            end = self.end[0]
            
            while n > 0:
                other += timedelta(hours=1)
                if other.time() not in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    n -= 1
                
            while n < 0:
                other -= timedelta(hours=1)
                if other.time() != self.end[0] or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    n += 1
                
            if n == 0:
                while other.time() != end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    if other.time() < start:
                        other = datetime(
                            other.year,
                            other.month,
                            other.day,
                            start.hour,
                            start.minute,
                            start.second,
                            start.microsecond,
                        )
                        
                    other += timedelta(hours=1)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine a business hour with a datetime")
```

By using this corrected version of the function, the `apply` function should now accurately apply the custom business hour offset, ensuring that the date ranges are correctly adjusted according to the provided start time and holidays.
