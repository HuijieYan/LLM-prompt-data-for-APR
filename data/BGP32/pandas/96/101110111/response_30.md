## Correction of the Buggy Function

After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test, it appears that the issue lies in the adjustment of business days and business hours within the `apply` method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The adjustment logic for handling negative values of `n` (e.g., going back to previous business day) seems to be causing the unexpected behavior.

To resolve the bug, the adjustment of business days and business hours for negative `n` values needs to be revised. Additionally, the resetting of the timezone and nanosecond for the `other` parameter should consider the type of `other` object before making changes.

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` method:

```python
    # this is the corrected function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = other.replace(microsecond=0)
            
            # adjust other based on n value
            if self.n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end and not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
            
            bd, r = divmod(abs(self.n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if self.n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
            
            # adjust by business days first
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other += skip_bd
            
            # adjust remaining business hours
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                next_opening_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
                bhour = next_opening_time - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other = next_opening_time
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                else:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By refining the adjustment logic and ensuring proper resetting of `other`, this corrected version of the function is expected to address the issue raised in the provided GitHub bug report and pass the failing test cases.
