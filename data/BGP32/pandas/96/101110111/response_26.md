### Analyzing the issue

1. **Symptoms**:
   - When using the `pd.date_range` function with custom business hours and adding holidays, the behavior is not as expected. The number of periods generated exceeds the expected count.
   
2. **Related Functions**:
   - The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is involved in calculating the next business hours based on the given input.

3. **Failing Test**:
   - The failing test creates a date range with custom business hours and holidays but doesn't achieve the expected result.

4. **Error Message**:
   - The `ValueError` message indicates a problem with frequency validation related to the inferred frequency not conforming to the passed frequency.

5. **Expected Input/Output Values**:
   - The buggy function should correctly adjust the business hours and handle the holidays to generate the expected date range.

6. **GitHub Issue**:
   - The issue is related to a similar problem where the generated date range with holidays doesn't match the expected number of periods.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug results from incorrect adjustment of business hours for periods that include holidays. The logic inside the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class is not handling the holidays properly. This causes the date range generation to exceed the expected count due to incorrect business day adjustments with holidays.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the `apply` function needs to correctly handle the adjustment of business hours while considering holidays. It should ensure that the date range is generated according to the specified periods without exceeding the count due to holidays.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Below is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            while n != 0:
                if n > 0:
                    if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
                        if next_opening.date() in self.holidays:
                            next_opening = self._next_opening_time(next_opening)
                        other = next_opening
                        n -= 1
                else:
                    if other.time() in self.start or self._is_on_offset(other):
                        prev_hour = other.hour
                        other = other.replace(hour=17)
                        if prev_hour > 17:
                            other += timedelta(days=1)
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    if prev_open.date() in self.holidays:
                        prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(prev_open)
                    other = prev_open
                    n += 1

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version ensures proper adjustment of business hours according to the provided date and handles holidays correctly to generate the expected date range outcomes.
