## Bug Analysis
The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file. The function is designed to manipulate time-related data for custom business hours. The issue arises when the function is called with a combination of custom business hours, holidays, and specific time periods, leading to unexpected behavior in the result, as shown in the failing test case.

The function tries to adjust datetime values based on business hours and handle edge conditions related to holidays and specific business hour intervals. The error message indicates a mismatch between the inferred frequency and the expected frequency, causing a `ValueError`.

The function interacts with various internal functions within the class like `_is_on_offset`, `_next_opening_time`, `_prev_opening_time`, etc., to handle datetime adjustments.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. **Adjusting Time Calculations**: Review and correct the logic related to adjusting time based on business hours, business days, and edge cases.
2. **Handling Holidays**: Ensure that holidays are appropriately accounted for in the time adjustments.
3. **Validating Frequency**: Verify that the inferred frequency aligns with the expected frequency based on the provided parameters.
4. **Ensure Correct Date and Time Values**: Validate and adjust date and time values to maintain consistency and prevent errors.

```

By updating the adjustment logic, handling holidays, and ensuring proper frequency validation, the corrected function should now properly adjust the provided datetime values based on custom business hours and holidays. The function is now structured to pass the failing test case and provide the expected output.
