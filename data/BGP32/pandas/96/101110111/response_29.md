## Analysis
The buggy function ` apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is causing issues when combining business hours with datetime objects. The function seems to calculate business hours and adjust the input datetime object accordingly but fails to handle cases involving holidays correctly.

The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` aims to create a `DatetimeIndex` using a custom business hour frequency with a holiday specified. However, the buggy function fails to account for holidays properly, leading to unexpected and incorrect outputs.

The error message indicates a `ValueError` being raised during frequency validation, specifically mentioning that the inferred frequency from passed values does not conform to the passed frequency. This discrepancy likely arises due to incorrect adjustments made by the buggy function when encountering holidays.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To address the issues causing the failing test and the reported bug on GitHub, the buggy function `apply` needs to be modified to correctly handle adjustments for holidays. The logic for adjusting business days and business hours should take into account the presence of holidays to ensure accurate calculations.

Modifications will need to be made to the way the function processes datetime objects and adjusts them based on the specified business hours, while properly accounting for holidays as non-working days.

## Bug Fix and Correction
After analyzing the buggy function, addressing the identified issues, and making necessary adjustments to handle holidays correctly, here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other) or other in self.holidays:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start or other in self.holidays:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other) or other in self.holidays:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = (
                        self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    )
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour or bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function should now handle business hour adjustments properly while taking holidays into account, thus resolving the issue. Make sure to test this corrected function to ensure that it now produces the expected outputs.
