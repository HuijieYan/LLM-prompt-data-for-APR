## Analysis
The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas` library is causing an issue when combining business hours with a datetime argument, especially with periods and holidays involved. This is evident from the failing test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` related to custom business hour offsets.

The bug seems to be related to the calculation and adjustment of business days and hours in the `apply` function which leads to unexpected behavior when processing the input datetime values.

## Bug Description
The bug occurs due to incorrect adjustments made within the `apply` function when handling positive and negative business hours. The issue arises primarily from the calculation and application of business days and hours to the datetime input. This discrepancy leads to unexpected output values causing the failing test case to emit a `ValueError`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic within the `apply` function to correctly handle the positive and negative business hours when determining the output datetime values. This involves ensuring accurate adjustments for business days and remaining business hours within the specified custom business hours, as per the provided inputs. Additionally, proper validation is necessary to conform to the expected behavior when combining custom business hours with datetime values.

Below is the corrected version of the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class that addresses the bug and ensures the function passes the failing test case.

## Corrected Version
```python
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Capture nanosecond for edge condition detection
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            
            n = self.n
            
            # Adjust business days and timings based on the specified business hours
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                    
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            # Calculate total business hours in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
            
            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
            
            # Handle remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By applying this corrected version of the `apply` function, the bug causing the failing test case related to business hour offsets should be resolved, and the function should accurately handle the specified custom business hours and datetime inputs without producing unexpected errors.
