To fix the buggy function, we need to adjust the calculation of business days and business hours within the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The issue stems from how holidays are handled when calculating business days and hours, resulting in incorrect date ranges when periods are used.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of holidays in the logic to calculate business days and hours. When holidays are present, the adjustment of dates does not consider holidays properly, leading to the unexpected generation of date ranges.

### Solution Strategy:
1. Modify the logic for adjusting business days and hours to correctly account for holidays.
2. Ensure that the date calculation takes into consideration holidays when advancing business days.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )

            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    while not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                        other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                while not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = self.next_bday.apply(prev_open + skip_bd) + remain
                else:
                    other = self.next_bday.apply(other + skip_bd)

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self.next_bday.apply(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour))
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making these adjustments to the `apply` function, it should correctly handle holidays when calculating business days and hours, resolving the issue with `pd.date_range` when using periods and holidays.
