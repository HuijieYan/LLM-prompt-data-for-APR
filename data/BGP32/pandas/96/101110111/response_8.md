## Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class within the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is causing an issue when used in conjunction with custom business hours and holidays. The failure occurs when trying to create a date range with custom business hours and holidays, resulting in extra periods in the output.

The problem seems to originate from the handling of holidays within the `apply` function, leading to incorrect date adjustments. The issue is related to how holidays are considered during the calculation of business hours.

The error message indicates that the inferred frequency from passed values does not conform to the passed frequency, indicating a discrepancy in the date calculation logic regarding holidays.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To address this bug, the code handling holidays in the `apply` function should be revised to ensure that the adjustments for holidays align correctly with the specified custom business hours. Additionally, the business hour calculations need to be adjusted to account for holidays and potential edge cases involving periods.

## Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function in the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            # Adjust for holidays
            if other in self.holidays:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            # Adjust other to reduce the number of cases to handle
            other = datetime(
                year=other.year,
                month=other.month,
                day=other.day,
                hour=other.hour,
                minute=other.minute,
                second=other.second,
                microsecond=other.microsecond
            )

            # Get total business hours by sec in one business day
            business_hours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = self.next_bday.apply(other) + skip_bd

            # Adjust remaining business hours
            adjusted_time = other
            if r != 0:
                adjusted_time = self._get_closing_time(other)
                while r > 0:
                    time_until_closing = adjusted_time - other
                    if r * 60 <= time_until_closing.total_seconds():
                        adjusted_time = other + timedelta(minutes=r)
                        break
                    r -= time_until_closing.total_seconds() / 60
                    next_opening = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_time)
                    adjusted_time = self._get_closing_time(next_opening)

            return adjusted_time
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By updating the logic in the `apply` function to correctly handle holidays and adjust the business hours, the corrected version should now produce the expected and correct date range output with custom business hours and holidays.
