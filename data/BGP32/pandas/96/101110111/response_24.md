### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is intended to adjust a given datetime value based on custom business hours specified by the user, incorporating considerations like holidays and business days.
2. The failing test case aims to use custom business hours with holidays specified, but the result is incorrect, generating additional periods when holidays are involved.
3. The error message hints at a mismatch between frequencies, indicating an issue with applying holidays within the business hours.
4. The buggy function manipulates the input datetime value `other` based on business rules and holidays, potentially leading to incorrect adjustments and period calculations.
5. The function should ensure precise handling of holidays and adjustment within the defined business hours.

### Bug Cause:
The bug likely originates from incorrect holiday handling within the business hour calculation, leading to an incorrect number of periods defined by the user.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure accurate adjustment of the `other` datetime value based on the specified business hours and holidays.
2. Properly handle the case when holidays fall within the duration to avoid additional periods being added erroneously.

### Updated and Corrected Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        
        # Reset timezone and nanosecond without using replace for Timestamp
        other = datetime(
            other.year, other.month, other.day, other.hour,
            other.minute, other.second, other.microsecond
        )
        n = self.n
        
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        while not self.is_on_offset(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By improving the logic in adjusting the `other` datetime value based on business hours and correctly handling holidays within that adjustment, the corrected function should now provide accurate results for the given test cases.
