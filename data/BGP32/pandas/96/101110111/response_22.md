### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is failing due to incorrect logic while adjusting the input datetime `other` based on the provided business hours. This leads to the unexpected output in the failing test mentioned above.

The function is designed to adjust the input datetime based on business hours, holidays, and other parameters, but it fails to properly handle cases when there are holidays involved, causing the unexpected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the adjustment logic for the input datetime `other` needs to be refined to correctly handle holidays and ensure that the result aligns with the expected business hours.

The adjustments should consider holidays explicitly and adjust the datetime accordingly to ensure that the correct business hours are accounted for.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # Other methods in the class

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            original_other = other
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            # Adjust other based on business hours and holidays
            while n != 0:
                if n > 0:  # Forward adjustment
                    other = other + timedelta(1)
                    if not self.is_on_offset(other) or other in self.holidays:
                        continue
                    n -= 1
                else:  # Backward adjustment
                    other = other - timedelta(1)
                    if not self.is_on_offset(other) or other in self.holidays:
                        continue
                    n += 1

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function adjusts the input datetime `other` based on the business hours and considers holidays when making adjustments. This should resolve the issue and align the output with the expected behavior.
