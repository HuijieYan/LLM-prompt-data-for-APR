## Analysis

1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is responsible for calculating the next business hour based on the input time and the business hours configuration.
   
2. The related functions in the `BusinessHourMixin` class are used for manipulating time values within business hours.

3. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is testing the behavior of generating dates with a custom business hour frequency and holidays. The test fails due to incorrect calculations in the `apply` function.

4. The bug causes unexpected dates to be generated with the custom frequency due to improper handling of holidays.

## Bug Explanation

The bug in the `apply` function is related to how the function adjusts the datetime values when holidays are involved. Specifically, the calculation is performed in a way that results in incorrect datetime values that do not match the expected output.

When a holiday is encountered, the logic to adjust the datetime value becomes flawed, leading to shifting by more than the expected number of periods.

The function also does not properly handle the scenario where `pd.date_range` is used with the `periods` parameter and a custom frequency with holidays, resulting in incorrect date generation.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting the datetime values in the presence of holidays needs to be revised. Proper handling of holidays and adjusting the datetime values based on the business hour configuration is essential.

Additionally, ensuring that the business hour calculations align correctly with the expected behavior when generating dates using `pd.date_range` with a custom frequency and holidays is crucial.

## Bug Fix

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
# Corrected apply function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None)  # Removing timezone information
        n = self.n

        # Adjust other to the nearest opening time
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Business hour calculations
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self.next_bday.rollforward(other)
            other = self.next_bday.apply(other)

        # Calculate remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
            if n >= 0:
                next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
                bhour = next_opening - other
            else:
                next_closing = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))
                bhour = next_closing - other

            if bhour >= bhour_remain:
                other += bhour_remain
                break

            # Proceed to the next business time interval
            bhour_remain -= bhour
            if n >= 0:
                other = next_opening
            else:
                other = next_closing

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With this corrected version of the `apply` function, the calculations are adjusted to handle holidays correctly and produce the expected datetime values when generating dates with a custom business hour frequency and holidays.

Make sure to test the updated function with the failing test case to verify that the bug has been fixed successfully.
