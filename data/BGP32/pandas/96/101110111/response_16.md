### Fixing the Bug in the Provided Function

#### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is causing issues when dealing with holiday dates during the adjustment of business hours.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is encountering problems when passing holiday dates while creating a date range with custom business hour frequency.
3. The error message indicates an issue with frequency validation, specifically the `ValueError` failing during the validation check.
4. The expected input/output variables for multiple cases provide clear guidelines on the expected behavior for the function.

#### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to the incorrect handling of holiday dates within the `apply` function when adjusting business hours. This causes discrepancies in the final output date range when using custom business hours with holidays.

#### Solution Strategy:
1. Update the code inside the `apply` function to correctly handle holiday dates by adjusting the calculations based on the presence of holidays.
2. Ensure that the adjustment of business hours accounts for holidays and adjusts the date range accordingly.
3. Validate the frequency and adjust the business hours calculations accordingly to prevent discrepancies in the output.

#### Corrected Function:

```python
from pandas._libs.tslibs.offsets import BaseOffset
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessDay, CustomBusinessHour

# The corrected version of the buggy function
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Extract date information from the timestamp
            date_info = other.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
            holiday_dates = {date(h.year, h.month, h.day) for h in self.holidays}

            # Adjust for holidays and business hours
            n = self.n
            adjust_days = n // 3
            adjust_hours = n % 3

            # Skip holiday dates within the period
            while date_info.date() in holiday_dates:
                date_info += timedelta(days=1)

            # Adjust for business hours
            if adjust_hours != 0:
                business_hour_freq = CustomBusinessHour(start=self.start[0].strftime("%H:%M"), end=self.end[0].strftime("%H:%M"), holidays=self.holidays)
                date_info = business_hour_freq.rollforward(date_info)

            # Adjust for business days
            if adjust_days != 0:
                business_day_freq = CustomBusinessDay(holidays=self.holidays)
                date_info = business_day_freq.rollforward(date_info)

            return date_info
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the logic to correctly handle holidays and adjust the business hours and days accordingly, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and provide the expected output for custom business hour frequencies with holidays.
