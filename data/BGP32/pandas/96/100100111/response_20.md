### 1. Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is suppose to adjust and calculate business hours based on the provided parameters. The failing test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` highlights an issue with CustomBusinessHour when providing holidays. The function is not handling the adjustment correctly, leading to unexpected results and failing the test case.

### 2. Identified Error Location
The issue likely stems from how the function handles holidays and the adjustment of business hours. 

### 3. Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when adding holidays in the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency. Due to improper adjustment for holidays, the function miscalculates the number of periods, resulting in an incorrect output with more periods than expected. This causes the failing test case and is consistent with the reported issue on GitHub.

### 4. Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the adjustment for holidays needs to be properly implemented in the `apply` function. The function should correctly calculate the business hours, consider holidays, and adjust periods accordingly. By addressing the holiday adjustment logic, the function should produce the expected output and pass the failing test case.

### 5. Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, date):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        n = self.n
        
        # adjust other to reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        # apply adjustments based on business hours and holidays
        for _ in range(abs(n)):
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with date")
```

This corrected version should address the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test case.
