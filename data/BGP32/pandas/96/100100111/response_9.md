### Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is responsible for adjusting a given datetime object according to a specified CustomBusinessHour offset. The bug occurs when using the `date_range_with_custom_holidays` test, as reported in GitHub issue #30593. The issue arises when adding a holiday to the CustomBusinessHour offset, leading to unexpected behavior in the generated date range.

### Error Location
The bug likely appears in the code section where adjustments are made to the provided datetime based on the business hours and holidays. Specifically, the calculation involving the `CustomBusinessDay` offset and holiday handling might be causing the incorrect output.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs due to the incorrect determination of the next business day when holidays are involved in the CustomBusinessHour offset. This leads to the date_range generating more periods than expected because of incorrect adjustments in the `apply` function.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, ensure that the logic for adjusting the datetime according to the CustomBusinessHour offset takes into account the holidays correctly. The adjustments should align with the specified business hours and skip any holiday dates to produce the expected output.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function to address the bug:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import ApplyTypeError, BusinessDay

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # check if other is a Timestamp, adjusting timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        # determine the next business day based on the current date
        bd = BusinessDay(n=1)
        while not self._is_on_offset(other) or other.date() in self.holidays:
            other = other + bd

        # adjust the time within business hours
        while other.time() not in self.end:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version takes into account the holiday dates when determining the next business day and correctly adjusts the time within the business hours.

By implementing this fix, the `date_range_with_custom_holidays` test should now produce the expected output without generating extra periods due to holiday date adjustments.
