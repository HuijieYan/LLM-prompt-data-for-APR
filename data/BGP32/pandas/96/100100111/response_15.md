### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is used to adjust a datetime value based on a custom business hour offset. The buggy function is supposed to handle different cases based on whether the offset `n` is positive or negative, and adjust the input datetime accordingly.
2. The bug seems to be related to incorrect adjustments of the input datetime based on the given business hour offset. The failing test case involves a custom business hour with specific start time and holidays.
3. Based on the failing test case and the expected input/output values, the bug seems to be in the logic that adjusts the input datetime inside the function based on the offset and the custom business hour specified.
4. To fix the bug, adjustments need to be made in the logic related to handling positive and negative offsets, ensuring correct business hour calculations and proper adjustments to the input datetime.
5. The corrected version of the function should accurately adjust the input datetime based on the custom business hour offset, handling positive and negative offsets, as well as holidays correctly.

### Correction:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import ApplyTypeError, CustomBusinessHour


@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, CustomBusinessHour):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(year=other.year, month=other.month, day=other.day,
                         hour=other.hour, minute=other.minute, second=other.second,
                         microsecond=other.microsecond)
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = CustomBusinessHour(n=bd)
            if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
            if bhour_remain <= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making these adjustments, the corrected version should now properly adjust the input datetime based on the custom business hour offset, handling holidays and different positive/negative offsets.
