### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is designed to handle adjustments for business hours based on a given input date(`other`). It involves adjusting the input date based on the offset specified in the `CustomBusinessHour` object.
2. The buggy function appears to have issues with correctly adjusting the input date when specific conditions like holidays or start/end times are involved.
3. The failing test is related to a scenario where custom holidays are included which leads to unexpected behavior in generating the date range. The output contains more periods than expected due to incorrect adjustments.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper adjustment of the input date based on holidays, start/end times, and the offset specified in the `CustomBusinessHour` object.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug related to the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` occurs because the `apply` function fails to handle adjustments properly when holidays are involved. It leads to incorrect date calculations resulting in more periods than expected in the generated date range.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Enhance the adjustment logic in the `apply` function to correctly account for holidays and adjust the input date based on the specified offset.
2. Ensure that the adjustments for positive and negative offsets are handled correctly, especially when dealing with business days and business hours.
3. Make sure that the holiday dates are properly considered in the adjustments to prevent generating incorrect date ranges.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        if 'nanosecond' in dir(other):
            nanosecond = other.nanosecond
        else:
            nanosecond = 0

        # adjusting other to reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        n = self.n

        # adjust other based on the offset conditions
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by second in one business day
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By updating the adjustment logic in the `apply` function to consider holidays and offsets correctly, the corrected version should be able to pass the failing test case and address the issue reported in the GitHub bug description.
