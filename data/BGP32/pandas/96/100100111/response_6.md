### Analysis
The buggy function is related to the `CustomBusinessHour` offset in Pandas. The function is supposed to apply this custom business hour offset to a given datetime object. The bug seems to be causing unexpected behavior when dealing with holidays and adjusting the time based on the Custom Business Hour.

The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` highlights the issue faced by users when using the `CustomBusinessHour` with holidays. The expected output is not being generated due to the buggy behavior.

### Bug Explanation
The bug involves incorrect date adjustments when holidays are present. The function should adjust the provided datetime object based on the specified offset (`self`) representing the Custom Business Hour. However, the adjustment logic seems to be faulty, leading to incorrect output, especially when holidays are involved.

The buggy function fails to handle the scenario where a holiday should cause adjustments or skips in the business hours, resulting in unexpected output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic related to handling holidays in the `apply` function. Specifically, the function should correctly account for holidays while adjusting the datetime based on the Custom Business Hour offset.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        date_before_adjustment = other
        other = as_datetime(other)

        if other.isoweekday() in {6, 7} or other in self.holidays:
            # Adjust for weekends and holidays
            other = self.rollforward(date_before_adjustment)

        # Adjust the time to align with the Custom Business Hour
        adjusted_time = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            self.start.hour,
            self.start.minute,
        )

        while adjusted_time <= other:
            adjusted_time += timedelta(hours=1)
        
        return adjusted_time
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should address the issue related to holidays and ensure that the adjustments conform to the Custom Business Hour properly.

By making these adjustments, the function should now correctly handle holidays and execute the necessary time shifts based on the Custom Business Hour.
