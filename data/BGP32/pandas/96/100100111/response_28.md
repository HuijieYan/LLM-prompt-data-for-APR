### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is intended to be used with business hours to adjust datetime values. It handles adjustments based on the given parameters and constraints.
2. The bug likely stems from the logic within the adjustment process since the function is not handling the holiday correctly, leading to unexpected results in the test.
3. The bug causes the output of adjusting business hours with holidays to produce more periods than expected. This discrepancy is highlighted in the failing test where the expected output contains extra periods due to incorrect adjustment.
4. To fix the bug, the logic of adjusting business hours needs to be modified to correctly account for holidays and ensure that the output aligns with the expected results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic that applies business hours to datetime values to consider holidays appropriately and ensure that the adjustment process aligns with the desired behavior.
2. Adjust the behavior regarding holidays within the adjustment process to prevent the generation of extra periods in the output.
3. Refactor the adjustment logic to correctly handle cases involving holidays and ensure that the output of applying business hours is accurate.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if other in self.holidays:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Cannot apply business hours on a holiday")

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), 120)

        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                if n >= 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

This corrected version of the function should properly handle holidays while adjusting business hours to datetime values, ensuring that the output aligns with the expected results in the test cases.
