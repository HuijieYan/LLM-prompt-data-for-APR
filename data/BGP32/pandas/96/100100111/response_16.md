### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` from the `offsets.py` file in the `pandas` library, specifically an issue related to custom business hours.
2. The function is intended to adjust the input datetime according to the custom business hours specified by the `CustomBusinessHour` object.
3. The bug manifests when dealing with holidays, causing incorrect behavior in the presence of periods along with holidays.
4. The bug appears to be related to the calculation of business hours and adjustments based on holidays, which leads to an incorrect output.
5. The failing test case involves a CustomBusinessHour with a holiday specified and expects a specific set of datetime indices but receives a different set due to the bug.
6. The bug may be due to incorrect handling of holidays within the adjust function based on the input datetime.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is occurring due to incorrect handling of holidays within the adjustment process, leading to unexpected outcomes.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Properly account for holidays while adjusting the datetime within the custom business hour.
2. Ensure that when a holiday is encountered, the adjustment correctly reflects the behavior specified in the CustomBusinessHour object.

### Corrected Function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other, holidays=self.holidays)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other, holidays=self.holidays)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other, holidays=self.holidays)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Applying the corrected function should resolve the bug relating to handling custom business hours with holidays correctly.
