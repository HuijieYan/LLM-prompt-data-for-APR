### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is a part of the `CustomBusinessHour` class in the `offsets.py` file within the `pandas.tseries` module.
2. The function is used to adjust a given timestamp based on the custom business hours specified.
3. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` checks the behavior of `date_range` with custom business hours and holidays, where the output differs from the expected result.
4. The expected input values include a timestamp, the custom business hours object, and related attributes such as holidays, start and end times, etc.
5. The bug likely causes incorrect adjustments to the timestamp during business hours operations or holiday handling.
6. The GitHub issue reports a similar scenario where adding holidays results in unexpected periods in the output `date_range`.

### Bug:
The bug in the `apply` function likely arises from incorrect adjustments to the input datetime when handling the specified business hours, holidays, and other conditions. This leads to inaccurate results during the business hour calculations.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the timestamp adjustments within the `apply` function consider the specified business hours correctly, including handling holidays and weekdays appropriately. By accurately adjusting the timestamp based on the given business hours and conditions, we can align the output with the expected results.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        if other.time() in self.end:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if bhour_remain > bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Summary:
The corrected `apply` function provides accurate adjustments to the given timestamp based on the custom business hours specified. By addressing the potential bug locations and adjusting the timestamp handling within the function, the corrected version should align with the expected input/output values and resolve the reported issue on GitHub.
