### Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is used to adjust a given `datetime` object based on the business hours specified in the `CustomBusinessHour` object. The failing test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is related to the issue described in GitHub, where the `date_range` function does not work properly when using periods and adding holidays.

### Issues in the Buggy Function
1. Incorrect calculation for adjusting the given `datetime` object based on the business hours.
2. The handling of business days and business hours adjustment is causing the issue.

### Bug Explanation
The `apply` function fails to properly adjust the given `datetime` object when dealing with negative business hours and holiday scenarios. This leads to incorrect adjustments and unexpected output in the failing test due to the incorrect calculation of business day adjustments and remaining business hours to be adjusted.

### Bug Fix Strategy
In order to fix the bug:
1. Correct the calculation of adjusting the given `datetime` object based on business hours.
2. Ensure that the adjustments for business days and remaining business hours are accurately handled.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n), business_hours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
            
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain:
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other) + timedelta(hours=1)
            else:
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                    other -= bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected version of the `apply` function should now pass the failing test and handle the adjustments for business hours properly.
