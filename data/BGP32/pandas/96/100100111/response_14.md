### Issue Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is not handling the adjustment of `other` correctly based on the custom business hours specified.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is trying to create a date range with custom business hours and holidays but the output is not as expected.
3. The bug seems to be causing an incorrect number of periods to be generated when holidays are involved in the custom business hours setup.
4. The bug is reported on GitHub regarding issues with creating date ranges with custom business hours and holidays.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `apply` function is failing to adjust the `other` datetime correctly with respect to the custom business hours and holidays specified. This leads to incorrect period generation, as observed in the failing test. The bug potentially lies in the logic concerning adjusting for holidays and business hours.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the adjustment logic needs to ensure that the `other` datetime is appropriately aligned with the specified custom business hours and holidays. Checking for both start and end times correctly in the adjustment process will help resolve the issue. Additionally, handling the cases where holidays affect the number of periods generated is crucial.

### Bug-Fixed Version:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other) or other in self.holidays:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start or other in self.holidays:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By applying the corrections to the adjustment logic in the `apply` function, it should now correctly align `other` datetime with the specified custom business hours and holidays. This should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the failing test now passes.
