### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is a method defined within the `Frequency` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The function is intended to operate on `datetime` objects but has an issue with adjusting dates based on custom business hours.
3. The failing test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` encounters errors when using `CustomBusinessHour` frequency with holidays, producing unexpected results.
4. The bug seems to be related to the adjustment of dates to business hours and holidays within the `apply` function.
5. The GitHub issue highlights a similar problem with adding holidays leading to an unexpected increase in the number of periods in the date range.


### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `apply` function seems to be related to the date adjustment logic based on business hours and holidays. The incorrect handling of holidays causes the date range generation function to produce unexpected results, as seen in the failing test case and the GitHub issue. The buggy function does not properly manage the adjustments for holidays, leading to incorrect behavior when calculating business hours.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug:
1. Ensure that holidays are appropriately considered when adjusting dates.
2. Verify that the adjustment to business hours is correctly calculated to prevent unexpected behavior.
3. Refactor the logic related to holiday handling to correctly adjust dates within the specified business hours.

### Corrected Function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if not self._is_on_offset(other) or other.time() in self.end:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = self._get_business_hours_by_sec(self.start[0], self.end[0])

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self.next_bday.rollforward(other)
            other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        current_time = other.time()
        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self.end[0] - current_time
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other = other.replace(hour=self.end[0].hour, minute=self.end[0].minute)
                    other += bhour_remain
                    return other
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other).replace(hour=self.start[0].hour, minute=self.start[0].minute)
            else:
                bhour = self.start[0] - current_time
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other = other.replace(hour=self.start[0].hour, minute=self.start[0].minute)
                    other -= bhour_remain
                    return other
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function should now handle the adjustments properly, accommodating holidays in the date range generation process.
