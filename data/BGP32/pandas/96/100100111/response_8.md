The buggy function is `apply` within the `CustomBusinessHour` class from `pandas/tseries/offsets.py`. The function currently has a bug causing incorrect output when dealing with applying custom business hours with datetime objects.

### Error Location:
The bug seems to be related to the adjustment logic in handling business days and business hours. Specifically, the calculation and adjustment of `bd` (business days) and `bhour_remain` (remaining business hours) are causing the incorrect output.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs due to incorrect logic in adjusting business days and business hours. This leads to the function not correctly incrementing the datetime object based on the CustomBusinessHour frequency, resulting in unexpected outputs, especially when holidays are involved.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the adjustment logic within the function should be revisited to ensure proper handling of business days and business hours. Correct calculations and adjustments need to be made to increment the datetime object accurately based on the CustomBusinessHour frequency, accounting for holidays and weekends.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
        
        # Business hours calculation
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = skip_bd.apply(other)

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_business_hour_duration_at_time(other)
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
        else:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_business_hour_duration_at_time(other)
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))
                    bhour_remain -= bhour

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With the corrected logic, the function should now handle the adjustment of business days and business hours accurately, ensuring correct output when applying a CustomBusinessHour frequency to datetime objects.

Please ensure to test the corrected function against the failing test case provided to confirm that the bug has been fixed.
