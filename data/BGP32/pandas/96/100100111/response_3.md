### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is responsible for adjusting a datetime object based on business hours specified by a CustomBusinessHour offset. The issue arises when using this function in the context of generating date ranges with custom holidays, as specified in the failing test. The test aims to create a date range under the specified CustomBusinessHour frequency while accounting for holidays.

### Identified bug:
The bug seems to stem from how the function adjusts the datetime object `other` when applying business hours. In cases where the adjustment requires skipping over holidays, the function may not handle the transition correctly, leading to unexpected results in the date range generation with custom holidays.

### Bug cause:
1. The function may not adjust for holidays correctly, leading to excessive periods when holidays are present in the range.
2. Incorrect handling of transitions between workdays due to holidays.
3. Possible issues with adjusting the datetime object if the adjustment goes beyond the current business time interval.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure correct adjustment for holidays, so they are appropriately accounted for in the date range generation.
2. Carefully handle transitions between workdays to prevent excessive periods or incorrect adjustments.
3. Develop a clear strategy for adjusting the datetime object based on the business hours specified, meeting the expected behavior for date range generation with custom holidays.

### Bug-fixed version of the function:

Here is the proposed corrected version of the `apply` function based on the identified bug and the expected behavior for generating date ranges with custom holidays:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, timedelta):
        return other + self.n * timedelta(minutes=60)

    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )

        n = self.n

        if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd) if bd != 0 else timedelta(0)
        other += skip_bd

        if other.time() == self._prev_opening_time(other).time() or other.time() == self._next_opening_time(other).time():
            other = skip_bd
        else:
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n < 0:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))
                        )
                else:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

        return other

    raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version aims to fix the issues related to adjusting the datetime object based on CustomBusinessHour offsets and handling holidays correctly, addressing the bug reported in the failing test.
