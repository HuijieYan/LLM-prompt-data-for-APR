### Issue Analysis
The buggy function `apply` is used to adjust a given datetime object according to the rules defined in a `CustomBusinessHour` offset. The bug seems to be related to how the adjustments are made, specifically when working with negative offsets.

The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` creates a `CustomBusinessHour` offset with a start time of "15:00" and a holiday on "2020-11-26". It then generates a date range starting from "2020-11-25 15:00" with 4 periods. The expected result contains timestamp values representing business hours, considering the holiday.

Based on the failing test and the expected input/output values, the `apply` function seems to have issues handling the adjustments correctly when holidays are involved. The bug appears when adjusting for negative offsets and holidays, causing the generated date range to be incorrect.

### Error Location
The bug can be localized to the part of the function dealing with adjustments based on the provided offset `n` and handling holidays. The condition branches where adjustments are made based on holidays and negative offsets seem to be problematic.

### Bug Cause
The bug originates from incorrect handling of holidays and negative offsets in adjusting business hours. When the offset is negative and a holiday is involved, the adjustments are calculated incorrectly, resulting in wrong timestamps in the generated date range. The function does not appropriately account for the holiday while adjusting for the negative offset.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To resolve this bug, we need to review and adjust the logic for handling negative offsets and holidays within the `apply` function. Specifically, the adjustments made when `n < 0` and a holiday is present need to be corrected to accurately reflect the expected outcome for the given business hours offset.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        elif n < 0:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._get_previous_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open - skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other - skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the logic in the branches related to negative offsets and handling holidays, this corrected function should now handle the provided datetime objects and offsets correctly, providing accurate adjustments. The corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
