### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class and is responsible for applying business hours to a given datetime object.
2. The error message suggests that the issue lies within the validation of the frequency when a `CustomBusinessHour` object is used.
3. The error occurs when the inferred frequency from the passed values does not match the frequency specified in the `CustomBusinessHour` object.
4. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of frequencies and the handling of business days and hours within the `apply` function.
5. The bug can be fixed by checking and aligning the inferred frequency with the provided `CustomBusinessHour` frequency when applying business hours.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the function to ensure that the inferred frequency matches the specified `CustomBusinessHour` frequency to avoid the ValueError.
2. Adjust the logic for handling business days and business hours to correctly apply the business hours provided.
3. Update the apply function to properly calculate the adjusted datetime value based on the business hours and days.
