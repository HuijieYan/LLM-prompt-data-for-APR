### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the validation of the frequency while using the `CustomBusinessHour` class.
2. The failing test is related to the validation of the frequency with custom holidays.
3. The error occurs when the inferred frequency from the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency `CBH`.
4. The bug seems to be in the validation function `_validate_frequency`.
5. The issue might be related to comparing the inferred frequency with the passed frequency, leading to a ValueError.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the comparison between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency in the `_validate_frequency` function. If the inferred frequency is None, it leads to a ValueError when comparing it with the passed custom frequency `CBH`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the inferred frequency is None separately to avoid the ValueError.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# import necessary libraries
import numpy as np

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # other functions in the class remain the same

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # existing implementation remains the same
        
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

    @classmethod
    def _validate_frequency(cls, index, freq, **kwargs):
        if is_period_dtype(cls):
            return None

        inferred = index.inferred_freq
        if index.size == 0 or inferred == freq.freqstr or inferred is None:
            return None

        try:
            on_freq = cls._generate_range(
                start=index[0], end=None, periods=len(index), freq=freq, **kwargs
            )
            if not np.array_equal(index.asi8, on_freq.asi8):
                raise ValueError
        except ValueError as e:
            if "non-fixed" in str(e):
                raise e

            inferred_str = "None" if inferred is None else inferred
            raise ValueError(
                f"Inferred frequency {inferred_str} from passed values "
                f"does not conform to passed frequency {freq.freqstr}"
            )

```

After making these updates, the comparison between the inferred frequency and the custom frequency should not result in a ValueError when the inferred frequency is None.
