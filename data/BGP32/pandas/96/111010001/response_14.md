### Analysis:
1. The error occurs in the `_validate_frequency` method where it fails to validate the frequency with the given dates.
2. The error message indicates that the inferred frequency is None and does not conform to the passed frequency `CBH`.
3. The bug is likely due to an issue with handling the frequency `CBH` in the `_validate_frequency` method.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the frequency handling for `CBH` is correctly implemented.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the implementation of `_validate_frequency` method to make sure it handles the custom frequency `CBH` properly.
2. Verify that the frequency validation logic is able to handle custom business hours.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            if isinstance(self, CustomBusinessHour):
                return self.apply_custom_business_hour(other)
            
            if isinstance(self, BusinessHour):
                return self.apply_business_hour(other)
            
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
        
    def apply_custom_business_hour(self, other):
        return self.next_open(other)

    def apply_business_hour(self, other):
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        return other
    
```

In the corrected version, the `apply` method is split into `apply_custom_business_hour` and `apply_business_hour` based on the type of business hour object. The custom business hour logic is separated for better handling of custom business hours. This separation allows for specific handling based on the type.
