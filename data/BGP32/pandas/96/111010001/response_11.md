### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is designed to adjust a given datetime object based on business hours.
2. The error message indicates a ValueError is raised during frequency validation.
3. The issue might be related to the frequency validation logic within the `_validate_frequency` method.
4. The bug is triggered when validating a custom business hour frequency `CBH`. The error message suggests that the inferred frequency is `None`, which does not conform to the passed frequency.
5. The bug seems to be in the frequency validation step for the custom business hour frequency.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the discrepancy between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency when validating the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency. The `freq.freqstr` is set to `'CBH'`, but the inferred frequency is `None`, leading to a failure in the validation process.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the inferred frequency matches the passed frequency, especially when dealing with custom frequencies like `CBH`.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
from pandas._libs.tslibs.offsets import ApplyTypeError

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            if not hasattr(other, 'nanosecond'):
                other = other.replace(nanosecond=0)
                
            n = self.n
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday().is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = (
                        self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    )
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(
                                other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                            )
                        )
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making the necessary adjustments in the corrected version of the `apply` function, the bug causing the frequency validation error should be resolved.
