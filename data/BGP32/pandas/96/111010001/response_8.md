### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the class `BusinessHourMixin` is supposed to perform business hour adjustments to a given datetime object. However, it is failing with a `ValueError` when the function `pd.date_range` is called with a custom business hour frequency.

### Error Location:
The error occurs when the `freq` of `pd.date_range` with a `CustomBusinessHour` is not compatible with the inferred frequency from the existing datetime index. This check is done in the `_validate_frequency` method.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the inability of the `apply` function to adjust the custom business hour frequencies properly, leading to a mismatch between the inferred frequency and the custom frequency, resulting in the `ValueError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `apply` function properly handles the adjustment of custom business hour frequencies to align with the existing datetime index. This can be done by modifying the logic within the `apply` function related to adjusting business hours and frequencies.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if (other.hour, other.minute) in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() >= self.start[0]:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                # midnight business hour may not be on BusinessDay
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    # business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = (
                        self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    )
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        # finish adjusting if possible
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        # go to next business time interval
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    # business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if (
                        bhour_remain > bhour
                        or bhour_remain == bhour
                        and nanosecond != 0
                    ):
                        # finish adjusting if possible
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        # go to next business time interval
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(
                                other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                            )
                        )

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the logic of the `apply` function to handle custom business hour frequencies correctly, the `ValueError` should be resolved, and the corrected version should pass the failing test.
