### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is meant to adjust a datetime object based on business hours. The bug in this function is likely related to the `DateOffset` frequency validation error that is being raised during a test. The error message indicates that the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency.

### Bug Location:
The bug is likely occurring when the function tries to validate the frequency of the `DateOffset` against the DatetimeIndex or TimedeltaIndex, leading to a ValueError being raised within the `_validate_frequency` method.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by an inconsistency between the inferred frequency value and the passed frequency value for the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency. This inconsistency results in the error being raised during the frequency validation check.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the inferred frequency matches the passed frequency correctly. This can be achieved by ensuring that the inferred frequency is calculated accurately based on the passed values of the index and the frequency. If there is a discrepancy, it should be resolved to avoid the ValueError during frequency validation.

### Corrected Version:
To correct the bug, we can modify the calculation of the inferred frequency within the `_validate_frequency` method to match the passed frequency. Below is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # original code body remains unchanged

        inferred = self._generate_range(start=other, end=None, periods=1, freq=self, ambiguous="raise").inferred_freq
        if index.size == 0 or inferred == self.freqstr:
            return other

        try:
            on_freq = self._generate_range(start=other, end=None, periods=1, freq=self, ambiguous="raise")
            if not np.array_equal(index.asi8, on_freq.asi8):
                raise ValueError
        except ValueError as e:
            if "non-fixed" in str(e):
                # non-fixed frequencies are not meaningful for timedelta64;
                #  we retain that error message
                raise e
            # GH#11587 the main way this is reached is if the `np.array_equal`
            #  check above is False.  This can also be reached if index[0]
            #  is `NaT`, in which case the call to `cls._generate_range` will
            #  raise a ValueError, which we re-raise with a more targeted
            #  message.

            raise ValueError(
                f"Inferred frequency {inferred} from passed values "
                f"does not conform to passed frequency {self.freqstr}"
            )

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This correction includes calculating the inferred frequency based on the passed values and ensuring it matches the specified frequency. This should resolve the ValueError related to frequency validation and pass the failing test.
