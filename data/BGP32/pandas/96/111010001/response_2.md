### Analysis:
- The buggy function `apply` is a method of the class `BusinessHourMixin`.
- The error message indicates a `ValueError` raised during frequency validation within the `_validate_frequency` class method.
- The function `apply` is used in the process of creating a `DatetimeIndex` with a custom frequency, leading to the frequency validation issue.

### Bugs in the buggy function:
1. The custom frequency `CBH` in the `freq` parameter is not being properly handled.
2. The `apply` function does not correctly adjust the business day based on the custom business hours.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the custom holiday frequency `CBH` is not being interpreted correctly during frequency validation within the `_validate_frequency` function.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `apply` function to handle the custom frequency `CBH` correctly.
2. Ensure that the business days and hours adjustments are accurately handled.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Update the apply function in the BusinessHourMixin class
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            if isinstance(other, (date, datetime)):
                other = as_datetime(other)

                for i in range(self.n):
                    if self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    else:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                        other = self._get_closing_time(other)

                    other = other + timedelta(days=1)

                bd_offset = BusinessDay(n=self.n)
                other = bd_offset.apply(other)

                return other
            else:
                raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By updating the `apply` function to handle the custom frequency `CBH` correctly and ensuring accurate adjustments for business days and hours, the bug should be fixed, and the failing test should pass.
