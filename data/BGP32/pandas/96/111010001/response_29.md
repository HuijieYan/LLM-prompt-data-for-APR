### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is supposed to handle business hour offsets when combining with datetime objects. The error message indicates a `ValueError` is raised during frequency validation on a CustomBusinessHour object.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of time zones and nanoseconds.
2. Calculation logic errors when adjusting the datetime based on business hours.
3. Misalignment between the expected frequency and the actual calculated frequency.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely due to the mismatch between the expected frequency and the inferred frequency during validation. This discrepancy might be caused by incorrect adjustments to the datetime object within the `apply` function, leading to an inconsistent frequency check.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure consistent handling of datetime objects with respect to time zones and nanoseconds.
2. Validate and adjust the datetime object based on business hours accurately.
3. Verify that the expected frequency matches the calculated frequency to avoid validation errors.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
            
            # Adjust other using business hours
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            # Calculate total business hours in one day
            business_hours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            
            # Adjust by business days
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
                
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not BusinessDay().is_on_offset(other):  # Check if current day is a business day
                    other = other - timedelta(days=1)
                other = other + skip_bd
                
            # Adjust remaining business hours
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            
            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    if n >= 0:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                    else:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version aims to address the potential issues within the original `apply` function to handle business hour offsets correctly and avoid the frequency validation error.
