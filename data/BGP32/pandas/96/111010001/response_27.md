### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` is a method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. It appears to be dealing with business hours and adjusting datetime values based on certain business rules. The error message is related to a validation check for frequencies when creating a `DatetimeIndex` with a custom frequency (`CustomBusinessHour`). The error message suggests that the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency (`CBH`) when creating the index.

### Bug:
The bug likely originates from the logic within the `apply` method that manipulates datetime values based on business hours. It seems that this manipulation is leading to incorrect datetime values, causing the frequency validation to fail.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the logic in the `apply` method needs to be revised to ensure that the datetime values are adjusted properly based on business hours without causing inconsistencies that lead to the validation error when creating the `DatetimeIndex`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = other + skip_bd

            if n >= 0:
                while r > 0:
                    open_time = self._next_opening_time(other) if r >= 60 else other + timedelta(minutes=r)
                    r -= min(r, 60 - (open_time - other).seconds // 60)
                    other = open_time
            else:
                while r < 0:
                    close_time = self._get_closing_time(other) if r <= 0 else other - timedelta(minutes=-r)
                    r += min(-r, (other - close_time).seconds // 60)
                    other = close_time

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected version simplifies the adjustment process and ensures that the datetime values are properly modified based on the defined business hour rules without introducing inconsistencies. This revised logic should prevent the validation error related to frequency when creating the `DatetimeIndex` with a custom business frequency.
