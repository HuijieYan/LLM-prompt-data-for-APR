### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class which is a subclass of `BusinessMixin`.
2. The error message indicates a `ValueError` is being raised during frequency validation.
3. The error occurs when the inferred frequency from the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency `CBH` (Custom Business Hour).
4. The issue might be related to the way the function `apply` is handling the passed datetime values and the frequency validation.
5. The error seems to stem from a mismatch between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency.

### Bug:
The bug in the `apply` function causes a mismatch between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency, leading to a `ValueError` during frequency validation.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the frequency handling in the `apply` function aligns with the expected frequency validation. This involves correcting how the function processes the datetime values and the specific frequency provided.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version, adjustments were made to how datetime values are processed, ensuring that the inferred frequency aligns with the passed frequency. This should prevent the `ValueError` during frequency validation.
