### Analysis:
The error message is a `ValueError` raised during the validation of the frequency in the `pandas.core.arrays.datetimes` module. The error occurs when comparing the inferred frequency with the passed frequency `CBH`.

### Bug:
The bug is likely related to the comparison of the inferred frequency, which is `None`, with the passed frequency `CBH`, indicating that the frequencies do not match or are not compatible.

### Cause of the Bug:
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is not handling the custom frequency `CBH` properly, leading to a mismatch in inferred frequency and the passed frequency when creating a `DatetimeIndex` with a custom business hour frequency.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `apply` function in the `BusinessHourMixin` class to correctly handle the custom business hour frequency `CBH`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function that will resolve the issue:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            if not getattr(other, "tzinfo", None) and self._has_timebased_attrs(other):
                raise ValueError("Cannot combine business hour with timezone naive datetime")
    
            n = self.n
    
            # create a copy of the datetime
            other = other.replace(tzinfo=None)
    
            # adjust based on the business hour
            if self._is_on_offset(other):
                result = self._adjust_on_offset(other, n)
            else:
                result = self._adjust_off_offset(other, n)
    
            return result
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version ensures that the custom business hour frequency is handled correctly, avoiding the `ValueError` when validating the frequency. This should resolve the failing test related to the custom business hour frequency.
