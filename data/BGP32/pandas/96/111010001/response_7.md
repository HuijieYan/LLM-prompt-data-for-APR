1. The buggy function `apply` is within the `BusinessHourMixin` class and is meant to apply a custom business hour frequency to a given datetime object. The function contains logic to adjust the input datetime based on the custom business hour, but it has a bug that causes a validation error related to the frequency not conforming to the expected custom business hour frequency.

2. Potential error locations in the function include:
   - The calculation and adjustment of the `n` variable.
   - Checking and adjusting the input datetime based on the business hour.
   - Calculating the total business hours in one day.
   - Adjusting the datetime based on the business days and remaining business hours.
   - The comparison and adjustment of business hours within the specified business time intervals.

3. Cause of the bug:
   The bug seems to be related to the frequency validation performed internally, specifically when comparing the inferred frequency with the passed frequency, which leads to a ValueError. The error message indicates that the inferred frequency is None, which does not conform to the passed frequency 'CBH'.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
   - Inspect the frequency validation logic within the function.
   - Ensure that the inference of the frequency is correct and aligns with the expected custom business hour frequency.
   - Update the validation process to handle the custom business hour frequency correctly.
   - Perform necessary adjustments to the logic to prevent the validation error.

5. Corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            # Properly adjust other to reduce edge cases
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            # Get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                # Midnight business hour may not be on BusinessDay
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    other = other - BusinessHour(0, start=self.start, end=self.end)
                other = other + skip_bd
    
            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With the corrected version of the `apply` function, the issue related to frequency validation should be resolved, and the corrected function should pass the failing test case.
