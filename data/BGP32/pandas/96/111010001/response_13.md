### Analyzing the buggy function and error message
- The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `offsets.py` file of the `pandas` library.
- The error message indicates a `ValueError` related to frequency validation not conforming to the expected frequency (CustomBusinessHour).

### Identifying potential error locations
1. The error is likely related to how the `Frequency` is handled within the `apply` function.
2. It seems that the error is triggered by a mismatch between the inferred frequency and the custom frequency `CBH` (CustomBusinessHour).

### Cause of the bug
- The bug is caused by the `apply` function not correctly handling custom business hours frequencies when validating them against inferred frequencies.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
- The fix should involve ensuring that the `apply` function properly handles the custom business hours frequency compared to inferred frequencies during validation.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            if not isinstance(self, CustomBusinessHour):
                raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
            
            n = self.n
            start = other.hour * 60 + other.minute
            
            if n >= 0:
                otime = start
            else:
                otime = start - 1 if start != self.start else self.end
            
            while n != 0:
                if n > 0:
                    otime = self.start if otime >= self.end else otime
                else:
                    otime = self.end - 1 if otime / 60 == self.start else self.start
                otime = (otime + 60 * 24) % (60 * 24)  # further past starting point belongs to future day
                n -= 1
            
            return self.to_offset().rollback(other) + timedelta(minutes=otime)
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Explanation of the correction
- The corrected `apply` function now correctly handles the custom business hour frequencies by determining the correct offset based on the time and the direction of adjustment (forward or backward).
- It is crucial to handle the adjustment based on the direction and the time boundaries defined by the custom business hours (`start` and `end`).
