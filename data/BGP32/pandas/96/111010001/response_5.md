### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the pandas library.
2. The error message suggests a `ValueError` being raised during frequency validation for a `CustomBusinessHour` object.
3. The issue seems to be related to the validation of the frequency against the passed values.
4. The bug might be due to the mismatch between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency.
5. The strategy to fix this bug would involve ensuring that the inferred frequency matches the passed frequency within the `validate_frequency` function.

### Bug Fix:
Here is a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# Fixing the buggy function
# Correcting frequency validation
def validate_frequency(index, freq, **kwargs):
    inferred = index.inferred_freq
    if index.size == 0 or inferred == freq.freqstr:
        return None

    try:
        on_freq = cls._generate_range(
            start=index[0], end=None, periods=len(index), freq=freq, **kwargs
        )
        if not np.array_equal(index.asi8, on_freq.asi8):
            raise ValueError(
                f"Inferred frequency {inferred} from passed values "
                f"does not conform to passed frequency {freq.freqstr}"
            )
    except ValueError as e:
        if "non-fixed" in str(e):
            raise e
        raise ValueError(
            f"Inferred frequency {inferred} from passed values "
            f"does not conform to passed frequency {freq.freqstr}"
        )
    
# Fixing the apply function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            # Original code logic maintained here

        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        # Remaining logic unchanged

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By ensuring that the inferred frequency matches the passed frequency within the `validate_frequency` function, the bug causing the `ValueError` during frequency validation should be resolved.
