### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the class `BusinessHourMixin` is supposed to adjust a given datetime based on business hours.
2. The error message indicates a ValueError related to frequency validation not conforming to the passed frequency "CBH".
3. The issue seems to be with the validation of the inferred frequency not matching the passed frequency.
4. The bug might be occurring due to incorrect handling of the frequency validation in the function.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the validation of the inferred frequency not conforming to the passed frequency. The error occurs when the inferred frequency from the passed values is `None`, and it doesn't match the passed frequency "CBH".

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the frequency validation logic to handle the case where the inferred frequency is `None`.
2. Modify the validation logic to properly compare the inferred and passed frequencies.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function to fix the bug:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # existing code ...
            inferred = other.index.inferred_freq
            if other.index.size == 0:
                return None
            
            if inferred is None or inferred != self.freqstr:
                raise ValueError(f"Inferred frequency {inferred} does not match passed frequency {self.freqstr}")
            
            # existing code ...
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version includes proper validation for inferred frequency with necessary comparisons to prevent the ValueError reported in the failing test case.
