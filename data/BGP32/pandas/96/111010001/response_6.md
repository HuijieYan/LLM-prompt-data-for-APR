### Analysis:
The error message indicates that there is a discrepancy between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency in the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. This discrepancy leads to a `ValueError` during frequency validation. The issue seems to be related to the handling of the frequencies within the function.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The frequency validation logic in the `_validate_frequency` method.
2. Incorrect handling of the frequencies within the `apply` function.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by the comparison between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency inside the `_validate_frequency` method. The error message specifically states that the inferred frequency is `None` which does not conform to the passed frequency `CBH`. This inconsistency leads to the `ValueError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the inferred frequency is correctly determined and that it matches the format of the passed frequency. This may involve adjusting the logic for validating the frequency and ensuring that the frequencies are compatible.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function in the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
# The corrected apply function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if not isinstance(self, BusinessHour):
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
        
        n = self.n
        
        if not isinstance(n, int):
            raise ApplyTypeError("n must be an integer value")
        
        other = as_datetime(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        
        bdays, bhour_remain = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bdays, bhour_remain = -bdays, -bhour_remain

        other = self._apply_business_days(other, bdays)

        if n >= 0:
            other = self._apply_positive_n(other, bhour_remain)
        else:
            other = self._apply_negative_n(other, bhour_remain)
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version:
- The `other` datetime object is converted to a compatible format.
- The business hours are calculated based on the start and end times.
- Adjustments are made for positive and negative values of `n` by applying business days and remaining business hours respectively.
- Additional checks for the type of `n` have been included to ensure it is an integer.

This corrected version should address the frequency validation issue and pass the failing test.
