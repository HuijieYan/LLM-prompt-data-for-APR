### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is meant to adjust the given datetime object based on the business hours defined by the class instance.
2. The error occurs when trying to create a `DatetimeIndex` with a custom business hour frequency.
3. The error message indicates that the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed custom business hour frequency.
4. The bug may arise from how the business day adjustment is handled within the method.
5. The issue might be related to how business days are adjusted and if the adjustments lead to conflicts with the provided business hour frequency.
   
### Correction Strategy:
1. Adjust the logic for handling business day adjustments to ensure it aligns with the provided custom business hour frequency.
2. Make sure that the adjustments do not conflict with the specified business hour frequency and the inferred frequency from the given values.
3. Verify that the adjustments made during the operation comply with the custom business hour definition to avoid inconsistent results.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function

from pandas._libs.tslibs.offsets import ApplyTypeError, BusinessDay
from datetime import timedelta

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Reset time to adjust for the given business hour
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
        )
        n = self.n

        # Adjust based on business hour start time and offset
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Get total business hours within a business day
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
        other += skip_bd

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        # Adjust based on business hours within the day
        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
            if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                other += bhour
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            else:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With the corrected version above, the adjustments align with the custom business hour frequency and should resolve the conflict causing the error message.
