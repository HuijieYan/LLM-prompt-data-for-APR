### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` within the `pd.offsets` module.
2. The failing test is `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in the `test_date_range` file.
3. The error message indicates a ValueError in the `_validate_frequency` method, caused by periods not conforming to the passed frequency.
4. The GitHub issue highlights a similar problem with `pd.date_range` when using periods and adding holidays, resulting in unexpected behavior.

### Bug Explanation:
The issue stems from the incorrect handling of business days, leading to miscalculation of periods when holidays are included. This causes the `pd.date_range` function to produce more periods than expected due to the wrong adjustments in the `apply` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `apply` function to correctly handle business days and holidays, ensuring that the periods are calculated accurately based on the specified frequency and holidays. The adjustments should align with the expected behavior of `CustomBusinessHour`.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0 or other.time() not in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                interval_end = self._get_closing_time(other)
                bhour = interval_end - other
            else:
                interval_start = self._next_opening_time(other)
                bhour = interval_start - other
            
            if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                other += bhour
                bhour_remain -= bhour
            else:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected version ensures the correct adjustment of periods when holidays are included, aligning with the intended behavior of `CustomBusinessHour`.
