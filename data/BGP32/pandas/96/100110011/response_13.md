### Issue Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply(self, other)` in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The failing test is `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays()` in the `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py` file.
3. The error message indicates a `ValueError` is being raised during frequency validation, which prevents the test from passing.
4. The GitHub issue describes a similar issue where adding holidays to `CustomBusinessHour` in `pd.date_range` results in unexpected behavior with the number of periods generated.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug is likely related to the calculation of business hours and adjustments made within the `apply` function. When custom holidays are introduced, the calculation of periods or end points may lead to incorrect results, as seen in the failing test and reported in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic of adjustments and business hour calculations to account for holidays and ensure the correct number of periods are generated.
2. Check for any discrepancies or edge cases related to business hours, opening/closing times, and adjustments when dealing with holidays.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Check if other is a datetime instance
        if self.holidays and other in self.holidays:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Datetime is a holiday.")

        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        adjust_periods = False
        if self.holidays:
            adjust_periods = True

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other) and adjust_periods:
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the logic and introducing a flag to handle holidays, the corrected version of the `apply` function should now be able to pass the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
