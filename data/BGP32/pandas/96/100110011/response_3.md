### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` within the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The error message is related to a failing test in `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` from `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py`.
3. The issue on GitHub highlights a problem with `pd.date_range` when using `periods` and adding holidays, resulting in an unexpected number of periods.
4. The bug seems to be related to the calculation of business hours and adjustments when holidays are involved, leading to incorrect period generation.
  
### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the `pd.date_range` with custom business hours and holidays to produce more periods than expected due to improper handling of holiday adjustments.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Refactor the logic within the `apply` function to properly adjust for holidays and business hours.
2. Ensure that the adjustment of dates based on holidays and business hours is correctly implemented to generate the desired number of periods.
3. Test the corrected version with the failing test to verify the fix.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        adjusted_date = other
        while n > 0:
            adjusted_date = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_date)
            if adjusted_date in self._holidays:
                adjusted_date = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_date)
            n -= 1

        while n < 0:
            if adjusted_date.time() < self._start[0]:
                adjusted_date -= timedelta(days=1)
            adjusted_date = self._prev_closing_time(adjusted_date)
            if adjusted_date in self._holidays:
                adjusted_date = self._prev_closing_time(adjusted_date)
            n += 1

        return adjusted_date
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version properly adjusts the dates based on holidays and business hours, ensuring the accurate generation of periods in `pd.date_range` when using custom business hours and holidays.
