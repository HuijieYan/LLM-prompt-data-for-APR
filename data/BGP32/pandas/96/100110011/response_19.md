The bug in the `apply` function is causing the issue reported on GitHub regarding the incorrect number of periods being generated when using holidays in combination with `pd.date_range`. The error message indicates a mismatch in frequencies during validation, leading to unexpected results.

### Analysis:
1. The main cause of the bug is how the business hours are calculated and adjusted in the `apply` function when combining a `CustomBusinessHour` frequency with holidays. The function logic for adjusting the datetime based on business days and remaining hours seems to be incorrect.
   
2. The failing test case (`test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`) defines a `CustomBusinessHour` frequency with a holiday and expects a specific series of datetime values. The failure suggests that the adjusted frequency calculation based on holidays is not correctly aligning with the expected output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the business hours adjustment and holiday handling in the `apply` function properly align with the provided frequency.
2. Check the logic for adjusting datetime values based on holidays and ensure it correctly reflects the desired behavior.
3. Update the `apply` function to adjust the datetime based on business hours and holidays provided in the frequency.

### Bug-fixed `apply` function:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour, BusinessDay

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        
        # Adjust to business time only
        if n >= 0:
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        # Logic to adjust based on business days
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), self.n * 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                # Skip non-business days
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # Remaining business hours adjustment
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
            if n < 0:
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)

            if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                break
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                if n < 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(
                        other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                    )
                else:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By modifying the business hour adjustment logic and holiday handling in the `apply` function, the corrected version should now align with the expected behavior in the failing test case.

Make sure to patch this corrected code into the appropriate location in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
