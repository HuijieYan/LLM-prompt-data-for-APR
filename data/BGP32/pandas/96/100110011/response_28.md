### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` is responsible for adjusting a datetime according to business hour offset.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py` is testing `date_range` with custom business hours and holidays.
3. The error message indicates that the inferred frequency does not match the passed frequency when creating `expected` `DatetimeIndex`.
4. This bug is related to a GitHub issue where using `pd.date_range` with periods, custom business hours, and holidays results in unexpected behavior.

### Bug:
The bug occurs in the `apply` function when adjusting a datetime to business hours with holidays. The calculation for adjusting business days and hours leads to incorrect results, causing the unexpected behavior reported in the failing test and GitHub issue.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for adjusting business days and hours in the `apply` function. Specifically, the adjustment for holidays needs to be correctly handled to ensure the datetime aligns with the custom business hours.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n), len(self.start))

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = other if self._is_on_offset(other) else self._next_opening_time(other)
            if other not in self.offset_range(other):
                other = skip_bd.apply(other)

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        if r != 0:
            if n >= 0:
                for _ in range(r):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                for _ in range(r):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other - timedelta(seconds=1))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By updating the adjustment logic for business days and hours, the corrected version of the `apply` function should now handle custom business hours and holidays correctly. This should resolve the unexpected behavior and make the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` pass.
