### Analyzing the Buggy Code and Test

The buggy function is `apply` defined in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file. This function is used for adjusting a datetime object according to a business hour offset.

The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py` attempts to create a date range with custom business hours including holidays.

The error message indicates a failure during frequency validation within `pandas/core/arrays/datetimelike.py` due to an inferred frequency mismatch.

The GitHub issue points out a related problem where applying periods and holidays together leads to unexpected results in the date range generated.

### Identifying the Bug

The bug likely lies in how the `apply` function is modifying the input datetime object when handling offsets. Specifically, the adjustments made for positive and negative offsets, business days, and business hours need to be reviewed for potential issues.

The discrepancy in the inferred frequency identified in the error message hints at a problem with how the business hour offsets are being applied and adjusted, leading to unexpected results when periods and holidays are involved.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments made within the `apply` function correctly handle the business hour offsets, accounting for holidays and periods accurately. It may involve revisiting the logic for adjusting the input datetime object based on the business hour offset provided.

### Corrected Function

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self._normalize_n()
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0)  # Reset timezone and nanosecond

        business_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(start, end) for start, end in zip(self.start, self.end))

        business_days, remain_hours = divmod(abs(n), business_hours)
        if n < 0:
            business_days = -business_days
            remain_hours = -remain_hours

        other = self._apply_business_days(other, business_days)

        while remain_hours != 0:
            if n >= 0:
                current_hour_range_end = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other))
                hour_diff = current_hour_range_end - other
            else:
                current_hour_range_start = self._next_opening_time(other)
                hour_diff = current_hour_range_start - other

            if abs(hour_diff.total_seconds()) < abs(remain_hours * 60):
                if n >= 0:
                    other = current_hour_range_end
                else:
                    other = current_hour_range_start
                remain_hours -= hour_diff.total_seconds() / 60
            else:
                other += timedelta(minutes=remain_hours)
                remain_hours = 0

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version includes adjustments to correctly handle business days, business hours, and the handling of remainders to ensure that the datetime object is adjusted according to the business hour offset provided.

Applying this fix should address the issue reported in the failing test and the related GitHub issue.
