### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is a method within the CustomBusinessHour class that processes datetime values according to business hours.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` aims to generate a date range with custom business hours and holidays, but it encounters an error related to frequency validation.
3. The error message indicates a ValueError raised during frequency validation with CustomBusinessHour frequency, hinting at a discrepancy between inferred frequency and the provided frequency.
4. The GitHub issue reflects a similar scenario where adding holidays while using periods in date_range results in incorrect periods, possibly due to the frequency validation issue.
5. The bug seems related to how the CustomBusinessHour is handling holiday adjustments, leading to unexpected period counts in the date range.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to improper handling of holidays within the CustomBusinessHour class.
When holidays are considered in the calculation, the adjustment for business days and business hours may not align correctly, causing a mismatch in the generated dates.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug:
1. Ensure that the adjustment for holidays does not affect the total number of business days and business hours accounted for during frequency calculations.
2. Make appropriate adjustments for holidays without disrupting the overall logic of business hours and days calculations.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function within the CustomBusinessHour class:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        initial_dt = datetime(other.year, other.month, other.day, other.hour, other.minute, other.second, other.microsecond)
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                
            if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and other.nanosecond != 0):
                other += bhour
                bhour_remain -= bhour
            else:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta()

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making adjustments to the business day and hour calculations while considering holidays, this corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
