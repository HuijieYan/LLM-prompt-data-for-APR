### Analysis:
The buggy function `apply` in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is causing an issue where adding holidays is resulting in an incorrect number of periods in `pd.date_range`. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` from `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py` demonstrates the problem. The error message from the failing test points to a problem with frequency validation, specifically regarding non-conformity between inferred and passed frequencies.

### Error Location:
The error seems to be occurring in the `apply` function when adjusting for holidays. The logic to handle holiday adjustments based on business days and remaining business hours is causing the issue.

### Bug Cause:
The issue arises because the function is not correctly handling adjustments for holidays within the business hours calculation. Incorrect adjustments lead to an incorrect number of periods generated by `pd.date_range`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the adjustments for business days and remaining business hours need to consider holidays correctly. The logic for adjusting the `other` datetime based on holidays and the custom business hour offsets needs to be revised.

### Corrected Version:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            adjusted = other
            while len(pd.date_range(start=adjusted, end=adjusted + timedelta(hours=1), freq=self)) != 1:
                adjusted += timedelta(hours=1)
            if self._is_on_offset(adjusted) and adjusted.time() not in self.end:
                adjusted += timedelta(hours=1)
        else:
            adjusted = other
            while len(pd.date_range(start=adjusted, end=adjusted - timedelta(hours=1), freq=self)) != 1:
                adjusted -= timedelta(hours=1)
            if adjusted.time() in self.start:
                adjusted -= timedelta(hours=1)

        return adjusted
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the `other` datetime to align with the custom business hour offsets and considering holidays correctly, the corrected function should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
