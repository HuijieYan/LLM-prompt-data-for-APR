### Potential Error Locations:
1. The adjustment process based on business days and hours calculations.
2. Handling of holidays and edge conditions during adjustments.
3. Calculation logic for adjusting the datetime object based on business hours.

### Bug Explanation:
The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is failing due to the buggy function `apply` not correctly handling the adjustment of datetime objects when holidays are present. In the failing test, a CustomBusinessHour offset is used with a holiday on "2020-11-26". The expected output should have 4 periods within the same business day. However, the buggy function does not handle the holiday and produces more than 4 periods, causing the test to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic to account for holidays in the adjustment process.
2. Ensure that the total number of periods remains consistent with the input parameters even when holidays are present.
3. Adjust the datetime object based on business days and remaining business hours accurately.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Validate if other is a datetime object
        if not hasattr(other, "date"):
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

        n = self.n

        # Adjust for holidays
        if self.calendar and getattr(other, "date", None) in self.holidays:
            delta = timedelta(0 if n >= 0 else -1)
            other = self._next_opening_time(other + delta)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * self._minutes_per_hour), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            add_days = bd * self.days_values  # Handle positive or negative business days
            other = self._adjust_on_days(other, add_days)

        # Adjust remaining business hours
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            curr_opening = self._prev_opening_time(other) if n >= 0 else other
            curr_closing = self._get_closing_time(curr_opening)
            next_open = self._next_opening_time(curr_opening)

            # Determine how many business hours can be adjusted within the current interval
            bhour = curr_closing - other if n >= 0 else next_open - other

            if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                # Move to the next business interval
                other = next_open
                bhour_remain -= bhour
            else:
                # Finish adjusting within the current interval
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the function incorporates the handling of holidays within the adjustment process, ensuring that the total number of periods remains consistent with the input parameters even when holidays are present. This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub thread and enable the failing test to pass successfully.
