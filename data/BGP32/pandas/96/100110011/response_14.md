### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is a method of a class with a decorator `@apply_wraps`. The function checks if `other` is an instance of `datetime` and then performs a series of adjustments on `other` based on the business hours specified.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is using `CustomBusinessHour` frequency with a holiday specified, which is triggering the bug.
3. The error message indicates an incompatibility between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency, which leads to unexpected behavior in the `pd.date_range`.
4. The bug seems to be related to the adjustment logic in the `apply` function, specifically when handling holidays, resulting in incorrect frequency calculations.
5. To fix the bug, modifications related to adjusting business days and hours need to be corrected to account for holidays and frequency adjustments correctly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to incorrect adjustments made in the `apply` function when handling holidays. The logic for adjusting business days and hours does not factor in the impact of holidays, leading to unexpected frequency calculations, as seen in the failing test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the logic related to adjusting business days and hours to consider the presence of holidays accurately.
2. Ensure that the adjustments made align with the expected frequency when holidays are involved to avoid unexpected behavior.
3. Test the corrected function with the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` to verify the fix.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # Adjust other based on business day logic
        if n >= 0:
            if not self._is_on_offset(other) or other.date() in self.holidays:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.date() in self.holidays or self._get_closing_time(other).date() in self.holidays:
                # move to the previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(days=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Business day calculation
        business_hours_per_day = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        
        business_days, remaining_minutes = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours_per_day // 60)
        if n < 0:
            business_days, remaining_minutes = -business_days, -remaining_minutes

        # Adjust by business days first
        if business_days != 0:
            skip_bdays = BusinessDay(n=business_days)
            if not self.end.is_on_offset(other) or other.date() in self.holidays:
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bdays + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bdays

        # Adjust remaining business hours
        remain_duration = timedelta(minutes=remaining_minutes)

        if n >= 0:
            while remain_duration != timedelta(0):
                hours_to_closing = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if remain_duration < hours_to_closing:
                    other += remain_duration
                    remain_duration = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    remain_duration -= hours_to_closing
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + hours_to_closing)
        else:
            while remain_duration != timedelta(0):
                hours_to_opening = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if remain_duration >= hours_to_opening or remain_duration == hours_to_opening:
                    other += remain_duration
                    remain_duration = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    remain_duration -= hours_to_opening
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By updating the logic in the `apply` function to handle holidays and adjust business days and hours correctly, the bug causing unexpected frequency calculations should be resolved.
