### Analysis:
The provided buggy function is part of the `pandas` library's `offsets.py` file. The function `apply` is meant to adjust the input datetime based on business hours offsets. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` uses the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency to create a date range with specific starting times and holidays. The error message indicates a frequency validation issue, specifically with the inferred frequency being `None`.

### Error:
The bug arises from the `apply` function not correctly handling the adjustment of business days when holidays are present, leading to an incorrect number of periods in the date range generated.

### Bug:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of holidays when adjusting business days within the `apply` function.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, it is essential to make adjustments related to handling holidays, which are causing an incorrect number of periods in the date range. Properly considering holidays within the logic of adjusting business days will resolve the issue.

### Corrected Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # Adjust for holidays
        for _ in range(abs(n)):
            if n >= 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                while other in self.holidays:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                while other in self.holidays:
                    other -= timedelta(hours=1)
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

        # Adjust for business hours
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            other += bd * (BusinessDay() if n >= 0 else -BusinessDay())

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
            bhour = self._get_business_hour_for_time(other, forward=n >= 0)
            if n >= 0:
                other += min(bhour_remain, bhour)
            else:
                other -= min(bhour_remain, bhour)
            bhour_remain = max(bhour_remain - bhour, timedelta())

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function should address the issue with the date range generation when holidays are present, ensuring the correct number of periods.
