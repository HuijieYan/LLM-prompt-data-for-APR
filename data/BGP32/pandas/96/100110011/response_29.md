### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is meant to adjust a given datetime value based on a custom business hour offset.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is trying to create a date range with custom business hours and a holiday.
3. The error message indicates a `ValueError` related to frequency validation.
4. The GitHub issue highlights a similar problem where adding holidays results in more periods than expected.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the adjustment of business hours based on holidays in the `apply` function is not handled correctly, leading to an incorrect calculation of the number of periods.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that holidays are properly accounted for in the business hour offset adjustment logic. Specifically, when a holiday is encountered, the function should skip that day while maintaining the correct number of periods.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Check if a holiday is part of the start offset
        if other in self.holidays:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        n = self.n
        
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
        
        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain > bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Applying this correction should address the issue by correctly adjusting the datetime values with respect to holidays and custom business hours.
