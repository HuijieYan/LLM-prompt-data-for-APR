### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `apply` function in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is checking if the `date_range` function works correctly with custom holidays using `CustomBusinessHour` offset. The test is expected to create a `DatetimeIndex` with specific datetime values and frequencies.
3. The error message indicates a `ValueError` is raised during frequency validation while generating the expected index.
4. The GitHub issue describes a similar problem where adding holidays in `date_range` with `periods` results in unexpected behavior due to more than the specified number of periods being generated.
5. The bug seems to be related to the handling of holidays within the `apply` function for custom business hours.

### Bugs:
1. The logic for handling business days and adjusting time intervals is not correctly considering holidays, leading to incorrect period generation.
2. The way holidays are accounted for in the adjustment logic is causing the discrepancy in the number of periods generated.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the logic for adjusting business days accounts for holidays properly.
2. Adjust the adjustment process within the `apply` function to accommodate holidays and generate the correct number of periods.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Fix the apply function for CustomBusinessHour
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        is_closed = self.is_on_offset(other)  # Check if current time is on offset

        # Adjust for holidays and weekends
        while n != 0:
            if n > 0:  # Move forward
                other += self.freq
            else:  # Move backward
                other -= self.freq
            
            if self.is_on_offset(other) != is_closed:  # Check if new time is on offset
                if self.on_offset(other):  # Move back to offset
                    if n > 0:
                        other -= self.freq
                    else:
                        other += self.freq
                else:  # Move forward to next valid time
                    if n > 0:
                        while not self.on_offset(other):
                            other += self.freq
                    else:
                        while not self.on_offset(other):
                            other -= self.freq

                n -= 1 if n > 0 else 1  # Adjust the period count

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By incorporating the corrected logic above, the `apply` function should properly adjust the dates for custom business hours with holidays, and the failing test should pass successfully.
