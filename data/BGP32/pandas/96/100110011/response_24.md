### Analysis:
1. The provided buggy function is `apply` within the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The error message is related to `custom business hours`.
3. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` has an issue where the expected result has an incorrect date. This indicates a problem with custom business hours calculations.
4. The GitHub issue indicates that when using periods and adding holidays, `pd.date_range` produces more than the specified number of periods.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect handling of business hours when there are holidays present. The issue arises from the calculation of business days, business hours, and adjustments, leading to incorrect results when custom business hours with holidays are used.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Improve the logic for handling business days and business hours adjustments.
2. Ensure correct alignment of the date and time while adjusting for holidays.
3. Update the logic to handle the application of custom business hours accurately.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if not isinstance(other, pd.Timestamp):
            other = pd.Timestamp(other)

        n = self.n

        # adjust other to remove timezone
        other = other.tz_localize(None)
        
        if n >= 0:
            while not self.on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            while not self.on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

        # adjust business days
        if n != 0:
            skips = pd.offsets.CustomBusinessDay(n=n).apply(other)
            other = other.replace(hour=skips.hour, minute=skips.minute, second=skips.second, microsecond=skips.microsecond)

        # adjust for business hours
        offset = timedelta(minutes=abs(n) * 60)
        if n < 0:
            offset = -offset
        
        while offset.total_seconds() != 0:
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
            else:
                bhour = other - self._prev_opening_time(other)
                
            if abs(bhour.total_seconds()) <= abs(offset.total_seconds()):
                other += bhour
                offset -= bhour
            else:
                other += offset
                offset = timedelta(0)

        return pd.Timestamp(other)
    raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By implementing the corrected version of the function, the issue with `pd.date_range` not working correctly with custom business hours and holidays should be resolved.
