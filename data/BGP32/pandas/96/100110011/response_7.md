### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` is not handling the case when custom holidays are provided correctly.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py` is not passing due to the incorrect behavior of the `apply` function.
3. The error message indicates a `ValueError` is raised during the frequency validation process, specifically due to mismatching frequencies.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the problem where `pd.date_range` does not work as expected when using periods and adding holidays, resulting in incorrect output.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect adjustment of the timestamp when holidays are encountered. The business hours calculation and adjustments are not accurately considering the impact of holidays on the time intervals, leading to miscalculations.

### Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug, we need to ensure that the `apply` function correctly handles the adjustment of timestamps when encountering holidays. This involves accurately skipping holidays and adjusting the timestamps based on the holiday schedule.

### Correction:

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        if n >= 0:
            other = self._skip_holidays(other, self._next_opening_time)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            while not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._skip_holidays(other, self._next_opening_time)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        if bd != 0:
            other = self._skip_business_days(other, bd)
        other = self._adjust_remaining_hours(other, r)
        return other
    raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

def _skip_holidays(self, other, fn):
    while other.date() in self.holidays:
        other = fn(other)
    return other

def _skip_business_days(self, other, bd):
    skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
    if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
        prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
        remain = other - prev_open
        other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
    else:
        other += skip_bd
    return other

def _adjust_remaining_hours(self, other, r):
    bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
        bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other if r >= 0 else self._next_opening_time(other) - other
        if bhour_remain >= bhour:
            other += bhour
            bhour_remain -= bhour
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            other += bhour_remain
            bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
    return other
```

By implementing the changes above, the `apply` function will now correctly handle custom holidays and adjust timestamps according to the provided business hours. The corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
