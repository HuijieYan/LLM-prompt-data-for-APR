### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` within the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The error message shows a `ValueError` raised during the validation of frequency for a Datetime index. This error is detected in the `_validate_frequency` method.
3. The GitHub issue reports an incorrect number of periods generated when using `pd.date_range` with `periods` and adding holidays, which aligns with the failing test code.
4. The bug seems to be related to the adjustment of dates based on business hours, which is causing the unexpected behavior in date generation.
5. To fix the bug, the adjustment logic within the `apply` function that handles business hours needs to be revised to correctly accommodate holidays and ensure the accurate calculation of periods.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect adjustment of the dates based on business hours, leading to an incorrect number of periods generated when holidays are present. The code fails to properly handle the scenario where holidays are involved, resulting in the mismatch of periods in the output.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to review and modify the logic in the `apply` function to correctly adjust the dates considering holidays and ensure the accurate calculation of periods based on business hours.

### Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if not hasattr(other, "time"):
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

        n = self.n
        adjusted_date = other

        while n != 0:
            adjusted_date += self
            if self.onOffset(adjusted_date):
                n = n - 1

        return adjusted_date
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should address the issue with date generation involving holidays and ensure that the calculation of periods based on business hours is accurate.
