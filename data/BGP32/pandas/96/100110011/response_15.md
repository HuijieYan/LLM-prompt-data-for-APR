### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is responsible for adjusting datetime values based on business hours.
2. The failing test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in the `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py` file is testing the behavior of `pd.date_range` with custom business hours and holidays.
3. The error message indicates a ValueError is raised due to a frequency validation issue while generating the date range with a custom business hour.
4. The GitHub issue reports the same behavior where adding holidays results in more periods.
5. The bug occurs when holidays are added to the custom business hours frequency calculation.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused due to the improper handling of holidays within the `apply` function. When holidays are detected, the adjustment logic for business days and hours does not account for the holiday properly, leading to an incorrect number of periods in the date range.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `apply` function needs to correctly handle the presence of holidays within the business hour adjustment logic. By skipping the holiday dates in the calculation and considering them as non-business days, the correct number of periods should be generated in the date range.

### Bug-fixed version of the function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) == 0:
            other = other.replace(microsecond=0)  # Reset milliseconds if zero nanoseconds
        
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        skip_holidays = any(h in self.holidays for h in (other.date(), other.date() + timedelta(days=1)))
        
        if bd != 0 and not skip_holidays:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying this fix, the function should handle holidays correctly and produce the expected date range with custom business hours and holidays.
