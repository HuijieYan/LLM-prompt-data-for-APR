### Analysis:
- The buggy function `apply` has an issue with adjusting the datetime based on business hours.
- The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` showcases the problem when creating a date range with a custom business hour frequency and holidays.
- The error message points to a `ValueError` related to frequency validation.
- The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in the number of periods created when using holidays in conjunction with a custom business hour frequency.

### Error Cause:
1. The `apply` function in the bug is not handling adjustments for holidays correctly, leading to unexpected behavior when calculating business hours with holidays.
2. The incorrect adjustment logic might be causing the date range to extend beyond the expected number of periods due to the presence of holidays.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `apply` function to properly account for holidays and adjust the datetime based on business hours.
2. Verify that the adjustments consider holidays and do not extend the date range beyond the specified number of periods.

### Corrected Version:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # Adjust based on business hours and handle holidays
        result_date = other
        for _ in range(abs(n)):
            result_date = self._roll_business_datetime(result_date, n)

        return result_date
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
        
def _roll_business_datetime(self, current_date, n):
    # Handle business hour adjustments and holidays
    business_hours = self._find_business_hours(current_date)
    if not business_hours:  # No business hours for the current datetime
        # Find the next business opening time
        next_open = self._next_opening_time(current_date)
        if n > 0:
            return self._roll_business_datetime(next_open, n - 1)
        else:
            return self._roll_business_datetime(next_open - timedelta(seconds=1), n + 1)
    else:
        return self._find_next_business_datetime(current_date, business_hours)

def _find_business_hours(self, current_date):
    # Check if current datetime falls within business hours
    for start, end in zip(self.start, self.end):
        if start <= current_date.time() < end:
            return start, end
    return None

def _find_next_business_datetime(self, current_date, business_hours):
    start, end = business_hours
    if n > 0:
        date_diff = (end - current_date.time()).total_seconds()
        current_date += timedelta(seconds=date_diff)
        return self._next_opening_time(current_date)
    else:
        date_diff = (current_date.time() - start).total_seconds()
        current_date -= timedelta(seconds=date_diff)
        return self._next_opening_time(current_date) - timedelta(seconds=1)
```

By revising the `apply` function to handle business hour adjustments and holidays properly, the corrected version should address the issue reported in the failing test and the corresponding GitHub issue.
