### Analysis
1. The buggy function `apply` is designed to adjust a given time based on business hours defined by the offset. It handles different cases depending on the input datetime and the offset's settings.
2. The error message is raised during the `_validate_frequency` function call, which is expected to check the validity of the frequency.
3. The bug causes the `ValueError` to be raised due to a mismatch between the inferred frequency from passed values and the passed frequency.
4. The bug is likely caused by the way the offset is being handled or assigned during the adjustment process.
5. To fix the bug, ensure that the adjustment logic considers all edge cases relevant to the custom business hours and holidays.

### Correction Strategy
1. Review the adjustment logic in the `apply` function to ensure correct handling of business hours and holidays.
2. Make sure that all modifications to the input datetime are valid and compliant with the business hour offset.
3. Adjust the logic to correctly compute the adjusted datetime based on the provided offset.

### Corrected Function

```python
# this is the corrected version of the function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        
        n = self.n
        
        # check if other is a Timestamp and reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = as_datetime(other).replace(tzinfo=None).replace(nanosecond=0)
        
        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # loop to adjust based on business hours
        while n != 0:
            other += 60 if n > 0 else -60
            if self.is_on_offset(other):
                n += -1 if n < 0 else 1

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

The corrected version of the function should now handle the adjustment of the input datetime correctly based on the defined business hours offset.
