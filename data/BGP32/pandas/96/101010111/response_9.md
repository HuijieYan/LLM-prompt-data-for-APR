### Analysis
1. The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the offsets.py file.
2. The function seems to be incorrectly adjusting the input `other` datetime value based on the business hours defined in `self.start` and `self.end`. The adjustments are not considering holidays correctly, leading to an incorrect number of periods calculated.
3. The error message indicates that the frequency inferred from the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency `CBH`.
4. To fix the bug, the adjustments based on holidays need to be improved to handle edge cases properly.
5. The correction should ensure that the correct number of periods are returned, considering the provided holidays accurately.

### Bug Fix
Here is the corrected `apply` function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

            if n >= 0:
                adjust_opening = other.time() in self.end or not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other)
                if adjust_opening:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:  # When adjusting for negative n
                start_condition = other.time() in self.start
                if start_condition:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self.is_on_offset(other):  # Check if on offset, adjusting if not
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # Calculate the total business hours in a day
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain

            # Adjust remaining business hours
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(prev_open) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other += bhour
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                    else:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the adjustments for holidays and ensuring the correct number of periods are considered, the fixed function should now pass the failing test cases and behave as expected based on the provided inputs and holidays.
