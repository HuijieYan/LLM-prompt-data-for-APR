### Analysis
The issue seems to be related to the behavior of the `date_range` function when using custom business hours and holidays, specifically with the `periods` parameter. The code provided in the GitHub issue is giving unexpected results by producing more than the specified number of periods when holidays are added.

The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `offsets.py` file of pandas is responsible for calculating the next business hour offset based on the input datetime and the specified parameters. The issue may be related to how the business hours are calculated, leading to an incorrect number of periods being generated.

The error message indicates a `ValueError` being raised during frequency validation, showing that the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency for custom business hours when holidays are involved.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `apply` function to correctly handle the calculation of business hours, taking into account holidays and the specified number of periods.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Check the calculation logic for adjusting business hours in the `apply` function.
2. Ensure that holidays are correctly incorporated in the calculation.
3. Validate the number of periods generated based on the input parameters.
4. Update the function logic to align with the expected behavior when generating custom business hours with holidays.

                        self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(original_date)) - original_date
                    )
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        original_date += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        original_date = self._next_opening_time(original_date + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(original_date) - original_date
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and original_date.nanosecond != 0):
                        original_date += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        original_date = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(original_date + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))
                        )
    
            return original_date
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the logic in the `apply` function, it should now handle the calculation of business hours correctly, ensuring that the custom business hours are generated as expected even when holidays are involved. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
