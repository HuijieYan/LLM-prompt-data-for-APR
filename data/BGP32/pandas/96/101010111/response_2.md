### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is supposed to adjust a given datetime object based on business hours and days according to the rules defined in the function.
2. The error message indicates a ValueError raised during the `_validate_frequency` method, most likely due to the mismatch in inferred frequency.
3. The function manipulates the `other` datetime object, adjusts it based on business hours and days, and returns the updated datetime object.
4. The bug may be caused by improper handling of the adjustments related to business days and business hours.
5. The bug fix could involve verifying the adjustments made for business days and hours, ensuring the correct calculations and comparisons are made.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Validate the adjustments made for business days and hours, ensuring the logic correctly adjusts the datetime object based on the specified rules.
2. Check for any inconsistencies or mismatches in the adjustments that may lead to incorrect results.
3. Ensure accurate comparisons and calculations when updating the datetime object for business days and hours.
4. Verify the handling of edge cases and scenarios to prevent unexpected behavior.
5. Update the logic to align with the expected outcome and resolve the ValueError issue.

### Code Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function based on the identified issues:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if not isinstance(other, pd.Timestamp):
            other = pd.Timestamp(other)
        
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= pd.Timedelta("1s")
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

        bhour_remain = pd.Timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != pd.Timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = pd.Timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != pd.Timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = pd.Timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - pd.Timedelta("1s")))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By applying this correction, the function should now properly adjust a given datetime object based on the defined business hours and days, resolving the ValueError issue reported in the GitHub thread.
