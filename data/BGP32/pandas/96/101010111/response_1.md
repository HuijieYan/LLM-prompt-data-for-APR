### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` from the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file. It is designed to adjust a given timestamp by a certain number of business hours based on the specified business hour range.
2. The error message indicates a `ValueError` occurring in the `cls._validate_frequency` method during the `freq` and `index` comparison. This error is likely caused by incorrect frequency validation due to an issue in the `apply` function.
3. The function seems to be adjusting the `other` timestamp based on business hours but not handling the case of holidays correctly, resulting in an incorrect number of periods when holidays are present. This causes a mismatch between the expected and actual frequencies, triggering the `ValueError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the holiday adjustment in the presence of holidays is correctly handled during the calculation of business days and hours.
5. The corrected function is provided below:
