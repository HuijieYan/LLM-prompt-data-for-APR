### Analysis:
1. **Bug Location**: The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `offsets` module of Pandas library.
   
2. **Errors**:
    - The error message reflects a `ValueError` during frequency validation in a test related to custom business hours and holidays.
   
3. **Issues**:
    - The custom business hours with holidays are causing an unexpected behavior in the `date_range` function.
    - The bug in the `apply` function is likely not adjusting business days correctly in all cases when holidays are encountered.

4. **Bug Cause**:
    - The issue arises from improper handling of adjustments related to business days and holidays in the `apply` function.
    - The discrepancy between the expected and actual date output can be traced back to incorrect calculations while adjusting for holidays.

5. **Strategies for Fixing**:
    - Ensure proper adjustment for holidays while calculating the new business days and hours.
    - Verify the logic for adjusting business days in different scenarios and adjust the code accordingly.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # adjust by business days first, considering holidays
            for i in range(abs(bd)):
                while self._is_on_offset(other) or self.holidays.apply(other - timedelta(days=i + 1)):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other - timedelta(days=1))
            other += timedelta(days=bd)
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = (
                    self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                )
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function includes adjustments for holidays and business days, ensuring the dates are correctly computed while considering the custom business hour settings and holidays.
