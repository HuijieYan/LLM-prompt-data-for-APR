### Bug Analysis
1. The buggy function `apply` is intended to adjust a given datetime based on business hours. It handles cases where the adjustment crosses into the next day, along with handling specific business intervals.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the function expects certain holidays and business hours to be treated within the adjustment calculation.
3. The error message indicates a problem with frequency validation when working with CustomBusinessHour offsets with specific holidays.
4. The issue revolves around the validation of the frequency of the given Datetime Index with the applied DateOffset.
5. To fix the bug, the validation of the frequency when adjusting for business hours and holidays needs to be revised.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Implement a fix within the `_validate_frequency` class method to properly handle the frequency validation logic.
2. Ensure that frequencies are correctly interpreted, especially when dealing with specific holidays and business hours.
3. Take into consideration the edge cases where adjustments cross into different days.
4. Improve the handling of the `ValueError` to provide a more informative error message that addresses the specific frequency mismatch issue.
5. Use the expected input/output values and types provided for each case to validate the correctness of the fix.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, Timestamp):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
    
            return Timestamp(other)
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version addresses the frequency validation discrepancies and should align the adjustment logic with the expected behavior for business hours and holidays.
