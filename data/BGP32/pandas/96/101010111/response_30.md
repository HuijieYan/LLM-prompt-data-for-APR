### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is a part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas.tseries.offsets` module. It is used to adjust a given datetime value based on business hours specified in the `CustomBusinessHour` offset.
2. The error message indicates a `ValueError` is raised during frequency validation, particularly when dealing with a custom business hour offset and holidays.
3. The expected input/output values for different test cases provide a basis for understanding the required correction.
4. The issue posted on GitHub highlights the problem when using `date_range` with a `CustomBusinessHour` offset and holidays, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The bug arises when the `apply` function tries to adjust a given timestamp according to business hours and holidays.
2. The calculation and adjustment logic inside the function is incorrect, leading to unexpected outcomes and invalid frequencies, as indicated by the `ValueError` during frequency validation.
3. The incorrect handling of negative business hours and the way holidays are considered contribute to the failure in the validation of the computed frequencies.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic in the `apply` function to correctly adjust the provided datetime value based on the specified `CustomBusinessHour` offset, taking into account both positive and negative business hours and holidays.
2. Ensure that the adjustment process aligns with the business hours specified and properly handles edge cases where holidays are involved.

### Correction:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )

            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                start_time = datetime.strptime("00:00", "%H:%M").time()
                end_time = datetime.strptime("24:00", "%H:%M").time()
                other_time = other.time()

                if other_time < start_time or other_time > end_time or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            else:
                if other.time() == self.start[0]:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            holiday_dates = {holiday.date() for holiday in self.holidays}
            while other.date() in holiday_dates:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By incorporating the necessary corrections into the `apply` function, the issue of the incorrect behavior when using `date_range` with the `CustomBusinessHour` offset and holidays should be resolved. The adjusted logic ensures accurate adjustment of the datetime value based on business hours and holidays.
