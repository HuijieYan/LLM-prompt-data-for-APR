### Analysis
1. The `BusinessHourMixin` class has a `apply` method that is supposed to adjust a given datetime based on the business hours specified by the class instance.
2. The `DateTimeIndex._validate_frequency` method raises a `ValueError` due to frequency validation issues when using `pd.date_range` with `periods` and adding holidays.
3. The bug in the `apply` method is likely causing unexpected behavior when using `pd.date_range` with custom business hours and holidays.

### Bug Cause
The bug in the `apply` method may be causing the frequency validation issue reported in the GitHub issue. The incorrect calculation or adjustment of the provided datetime based on the business hours may lead to incorrect datetime indexing causing the frequency validation to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that the adjustments made to the given datetime in the `apply` method are correctly aligning with the expected business hours.
2. Verify that the adjustments made to the datetime do not cause the output to deviate from the specified frequency, leading to validation errors.

### Bug Fix and Code Correction
```python
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
            
            adjust_date = other
            while n != 0:
                if n > 0:
                    adjust_date = self._next_opening_time(adjust_date)
                    n -= 1
                else:
                    adjust_date = self._prev_opening_time(adjust_date)
                    n += 1
            
            return adjust_date
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the datetime based on the business hours in a more straightforward manner, the corrected `apply` method will ensure that the output datetime aligns with the expected business hours. This should resolve the frequency validation issues seen in the failing tests and reported in the GitHub issue.
