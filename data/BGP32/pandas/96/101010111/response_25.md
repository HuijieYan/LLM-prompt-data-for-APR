### Analysis
The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is supposed to adjust a given timestamp based on business hours defined by the class attributes. The bug seems to be related to the calculation of the next and previous business hours when a holiday is involved. 

The failing test is related to the usage of `pd.date_range` with a custom business hour frequency and holidays, which leads to an incorrect number of periods in the output.

### Bug Explanation
The bug seems to be caused by the improper handling of holidays in the `apply` function. When calculating the next and previous business hours, the logic needs to consider holidays so that the correct number of periods is calculated. This is not being handled correctly in the current implementation, leading to the mismatch between the expected and actual number of periods in the output.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `apply` function to properly account for holidays when calculating the next and previous business hours. This can involve updating the code to consider holidays in the calculations and ensure the correct number of business hours are counted.

### Bug-fixed code
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class, considering the adjustments needed to handle holidays:
```python
# this is the fixed version of the apply function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        
        # Reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        
        n = self.n
        
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd, holidays=self.holidays)
            other = other + skip_bd
        
        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        
        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            if n >= 0:
                target_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
                next_business_hour = min(
                    self._get_closing_time(target_time),
                    other + bhour_remain
                )
                bhour_remain -= next_business_hour - other
                other = next_business_hour
            else:
                previous_business_hour = self._get_closing_time(
                    self._prev_opening_time(other)
                )
                
                if previous_business_hour >= other + bhour_remain and (
                    previous_business_hour != other + bhour_remain
                    or nanosecond == 0
                ):
                    other = other + bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= previous_business_hour - other
                    other = self._get_closing_time(
                        self._next_opening_time(previous_business_hour - timedelta(seconds=1))
                    )
    
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

Make sure to update the logic for adjusting the next and previous business hours with holidays in mind. This should fix the problem reported in the GitHub issue mentioned.
