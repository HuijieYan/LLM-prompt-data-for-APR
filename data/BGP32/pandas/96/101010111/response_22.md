### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is a method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class.
2. It seems that the bug is related to the incorrect handling of business hours and offsets when generating dates within the `pandas` library.
3. The error message indicates a `ValueError` being raised in the `_validate_frequency` method of the `DatetimeArray` class. This suggests that the frequency validation is failing due to an inconsistency between inferred and passed frequencies.
4. The bug causes unexpected dates to be generated when using `pd.date_range` with business hours and holidays, resulting in more periods than expected.
5. To fix the bug, proper adjustments need to be made in the `apply` method to ensure the correct generation of dates based on business hours and offsets.
6. The issue on GitHub confirms the incorrect behavior of `date_range` when using periods and holidays, indicating that the solution is to use the corresponding end instead of periods.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the improper adjustment of dates in the `apply` method, resulting in unexpected behavior when generating dates in the presence of holidays and specific business hours.

### Suggested Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `apply` method to correctly handle the business hours, holidays, and offsets. We should ensure that the dates generated align with the specified business hours and holidays.

### Corrected Version:

```python
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            # Adjust other based on business hours and offsets
            if n >= 0:
                while not self.is_on_offset(other) or other.time() in self.end:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                while not self.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

By making the adjustments outlined in the corrected `apply` method, the bug should be resolved and the `date_range` function should now work as expected when using business hours and holidays.

This should address the issue described in the GitHub report and ensure the correct generation of dates with custom business hours and holidays.
