### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is supposed to adjust a given datetime object according to the business hours specified by the custom business hour frequency. The function performs calculations based on the input datetime and business hours data, adjusting the input datetime accordingly.
2. The error message indicates that there is a `ValueError` being raised within the function `_validate_frequency` related to checking if frequencies are compatible with the given values.
3. The bug is likely causing incorrect adjustments to the datetime object, leading to incompatible frequencies. This is reflected in the failing test case.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments made to the input datetime align with the specified business hours properly to avoid frequency compatibility issues.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. The adjustments to the given datetime object must consider the business hours specified by the custom business hour frequency.
2. Make sure that the adjustment logic in the `apply` function correctly aligns the datetime with the custom business hours to avoid the frequency incompatibility issue.
3. Check if any inaccuracies in the adjustment logic lead to improper handling of the input datetime.

### Bug-free Function Code:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # Adjust other datetime based on business hours
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Calculate total business hours in a day
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days if needed
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # Remaining business hours adjustment
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By fixing the adjustments based on the business hours correctly, the bug in the `apply` function should be resolved, allowing it to handle the datetime adjustments according to the custom business hour frequency without compatibility issues.
