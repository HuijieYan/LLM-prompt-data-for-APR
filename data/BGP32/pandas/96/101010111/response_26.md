### Bug Analysis:
1. **Issue**: The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is not handling the adjustment of dates correctly when holidays are involved. This results in unexpected behavior when generating dates.
   
2. **Bug Location**:
   - The bug seems to stem from the adjustment of dates based on holidays and the definition of business hours intervals.
   
3. **Bug Explanation**:
   - The bug causes the function `apply` to miscalculate the adjustment of dates when holidays are present, leading to more or fewer periods than expected in the result.
   - The error message indicates that inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency when holidays are introduced, causing the validation failure.
   
4. **Bug Fix Strategy**:
   - To fix the bug, modifications are needed in the logic responsible for adjusting dates based on holidays and maintaining the correct frequency of business hours.
   - Ensure that the adjustment accounts for holidays correctly and aligns with the specified business hours interval.

### Bug-free Function
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# Fix the apply function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        
        if isinstance(other, Timestamp):
            other = other.to_pydatetime().replace(tzinfo=None)
        
        if len(self.holidays) > 0 and date(other.year, other.month, other.day) in self.holidays:
            while True:
                other += timedelta(hours=1)
                if date(other.year, other.month, other.day) not in self.holidays:
                    break
        
        if n >= 0:
            if not (self.start[0] <= other.time() < self.end[0]) or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        return other
    
    raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the logic for handling holidays and correctly applying the shift to the date, this corrected version should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure the expected output for the described test cases.
