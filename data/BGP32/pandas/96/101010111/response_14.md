### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is a method of the class `BusinessHourMixin`, which is part of the `pandas` library.
2. The `apply` function is designed to adjust a given timestamp based on business hours specified by the custom business hour offset.
3. The error message indicates a `ValueError` being raised during a frequency validation check when calling `pd.date_range` with custom business hours and holidays.
4. The expected input values are a timestamp, a custom business hour offset, and some attributes defined by the class.
5. The expected output is a timestamp adjusted based on the provided business hours.
6. The bug likely lies in the logic of adjusting the timestamp to the next business day and processing the remaining business hours.

### Bug Explanation:
- The bug in the code seems to arise from a miscalculation or mishandling in adjusting the provided timestamp based on the custom business hours, causing unexpected behavior while executing the function.
- The error message generated from the failing test indicates that the inferred frequency from the passed values does not conform to the specified frequency, leading to the `ValueError`.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, the adjustment logic regarding moving the timestamp to the next business day and handling remaining business hours needs to be reviewed and revised. Additionally, validating the frequency in the context of custom business hours and holidays should be reconsidered.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Reset the timestamp's properties excluding the timezone and nanosecond
            other = other.replace(hour=other.hour, minute=other.minute, second=other.second, microsecond=other.microsecond)
            n = self.n

            # Adjust the timestamp based on the custom business hours
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # Calculate the total business hours in one business day
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

            # Business day and remaining time adjustment
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + skip_bd)

            # Adjust remaining business hours
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain.total_seconds() > 0:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other if n >= 0 else self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                else:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By refining the adjustment logic and ensuring proper handling of timestamps and remaining business hours, the corrected version of the function should address the bug identified in the failing test case.
