### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is intended to adjust a given timestamp according to the defined business hours and offset.
2. The error occurs when the function is used in conjunction with `pd.date_range` with custom business hours and a holiday added.
3. The error message indicates a `ValueError` being raised during the validation of the frequency.
4. The bug results in the generation of more timestamps than expected in the `pd.date_range` function due to the incorrect handling of holidays.

### Bug Cause:
When calculating the adjusted timestamp in the `apply` function, the wrong logic creates discrepancies when a holiday needs to be considered. This results in incorrect frequency validation, leading to the raised `ValueError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure proper handling of holidays in the `apply` function to correctly adjust the timestamps.
2. Verify the logic for adjusting timestamps based on business hours and holidays.
3. Update the `apply` function to handle holidays appropriately while adjusting the timestamps.

### Corrected Code:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # other methods as before...

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Remove nanosecond adjustment
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            # Adjust other for the given business offset and handle holidays
            if n >= 0:
                if not self._is_on_offset(other) or other.time() in self.end or other in self.holidays:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other) or other in self.holidays:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            # Remaining code for adjusting by business hours
            # remains the same

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function should now properly adjust timestamps according to the defined business hours and handle holidays correctly. This fix should resolve the issue raised in the GitHub bug report.
