### Analysis
- The buggy function `apply` is a method of class `BusinessHourMixin` responsible for applying a custom business hour offset.
- The error message is related to the failing test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` when using `date_range` with a custom business hour frequency.
- The failure occurs due to an incorrect adjustment of time intervals in the `apply` function.
- The function seems to be incorrectly handling adjustments for negative numbers of business hours.
- The bug affects how business days are calculated and may result in incorrect adjustments.

### Bug Cause
- The bug is caused by improper handling of negative business hour offset values in the `apply` function.
- In the case of negative business hours, adjustments to the `other` time value are not correctly calculated, leading to unexpected results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Revise the logic for adjusting time intervals when dealing with negative business hour offsets.
- Ensure that adjustments account for both positive and negative values properly.
- Check the calculations for business days and remaining business hours to ensure accurate adjustments.

### Updated Function
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n > 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            while not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                other = skip_bd._next_opening_time(other)
            other += skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other) + timedelta(0, 1)
                
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the logic for adjusting time intervals and ensuring proper handling of negative business hour offsets, the function should now produce the expected output and pass the failing test case.
