### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is supposed to apply a CustomBusinessHour offset to a datetime input. The function contains multiple conditions and operations to adjust the input time based on the offset's business hour schedule.
2. The error message indicates a `ValueError` being raised during the validation of a frequency when generating a date range with CustomBusinessHour frequency.
3. The bug may stem from improper handling of holidays during the adjustment process or incorrect frequency validation.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the adjustment logic considers holidays correctly and that the frequency validation does not raise errors.
5. We will need to update the logic within the `apply` function to properly adjust the input time based on the CustomBusinessHour offset and handle holidays effectively.

### Bug Fix:
```python
from pandas._libs.tslibs.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin:
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            holiday_dates = [h.date() for h in self.holidays]
            
            if n >= 0:
                while True:
                    if other.time() in self.end or other.date() in holiday_dates:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    else:
                        break
            else:
                while True:
                    if other.time() in self.start or other.date() in holiday_dates:
                        other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                    elif not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                        other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                    else:
                        break
            
            bd = abs(n) // len(self.weekmask.split())
            if n < 0:
                bd = -bd
                
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = other + skip_bd
                else:
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=(n % 60))
                
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other = other + bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Explanation:
- In the fixed code:
  - Adjustments for holidays are properly included in the loop logic for both positive and negative offsets.
  - The calculation for adjusting by business days (bd) is updated to consider the number of business days within the offset period.
  - The loop handling the remaining business hours correctly updates the `other` time value.
  
The updated logic should address the issue with generating an unexpected number of periods when using `pd.date_range` with a CustomBusinessHour frequency and holidays.
