## Analysis
The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class has issues handling the adjustment of business hours and holidays, leading to unexpected results in the test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.

### Identified Issues
1. The calculation of business hours to adjust in each business time interval is incorrect.
2. The handling of adjusting dates when reaching the next business time interval is flawed.
3. The treatment of holidays during the adjustment process is not implemented correctly.

### Bug Cause
The buggy function does not properly consider holidays and handle the adjustment of business hours, resulting in unexpected output from the `pd.date_range` function in the test case.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Update the calculation of business hours to adjust in each business time interval.
2. Improve the logic for adjusting dates when transitioning to the next business time interval.
3. Enhance the handling of holidays to ensure correct adjustments in the presence of holiday dates.

### Bug-fixed Version of the Function

Here is the corrected `apply` function with the issues addressed:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessHour, CustomBusinessDay

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            old_other = other

            if n >= 0:
                while n > 0:
                    if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                        n -= 1
            else:
                while n < 0:
                    if other.time() in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                        n += 1

            if n == 0:
                return old_other

            remaining_delta = CustomBusinessDay(n=n) + (other - old_other)
            return old_other + remaining_delta

        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By fixing the inconsistencies in calculating business hours and adjusting dates, the corrected function should now pass the failing test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.
