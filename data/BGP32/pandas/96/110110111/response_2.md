### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` inside the `BusinessHourMixin` class of the offsets.py file in pandas is causing an issue in the `CustomBusinessHour` offset calculation.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` fails due to incorrect date output when end times cross the holiday periods.
3. The error message indicates a `ValueError` related to frequency validation, which suggests the incorrect computation of business hours around holidays.
4. The bug causes unexpected dates to be generated when periods and holidays are specified in `pd.date_range` with `CustomBusinessHour`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the logic for adjusting business hours with holidays is handled correctly.
2. Modify the logic regarding offset adjustments around holidays to produce the expected behavior.
3. Verify that the generated dates in `pd.date_range` are correct even when holidays are included.

### Bug Fix Implementation:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # extract nanosecond to detect edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(
                                other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                            )
                        )
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying this fix, the corrected function should correctly adjust the business hours around holidays, ensuring that the `pd.date_range` function generates the expected output when using the `CustomBusinessHour` offset.
