### Analysis
The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` is causing failures in the `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` test in `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py`. The error is raised during pandas execution related to date validation, specifically when encountering non-fixed frequencies like CustomBusinessHour. 

The buggy function seems to have issues with correctly determining the next business hour when holidays are involved, leading to an incorrect number of periods being generated. This causes the mismatch in the expected and actual output, resulting in a failing test case.

### Error Cause
The bug likely stems from the misinterpretation of how holidays should affect the calculation of business hours in the CustomBusinessHour frequency. The issue manifests when adjusting the timestamp to account for holidays and business hours, which leads to an incorrect interpretation of working days.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to update the logic in the `apply` function to properly handle holidays and ensure that the correct business hours are accounted for without exceeding the expected number of periods. Adjustment to the calculation of business days and remaining hours should address the issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the apply function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if not isinstance(other, pd.Timestamp):
            other = pd.Timestamp(other)

        ts = other
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0 and ts.time() in self.end:
            ts = self._next_opening_time(ts)

        if n < 0 and ts.time() in self.start:
            ts = ts - timedelta(seconds=1)

        ts = self._get_opening_time(ts)
        ts = self._skip_custom_bh_days(ts, n)

        hours = self._business_hours_timedelta()
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n), hours.total_seconds() // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            ts = self._skip_custom_bh_days(ts, bd)

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                ts = self._next_opening_time(ts)
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(ts) - ts
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    ts += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    ts = self._next_opening_time(ts)
        else:
            while bhour_remain < timedelta(0):
                ts = self._get_closing_time(ts)
                bhour = ts - self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(ts))
                if abs(bhour_remain) < bhour:
                    ts += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain += bhour
                    ts = self._prev_opening_time(ts)

        return ts
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By applying this corrected version of the `apply` function, the failing test case related to holidays in `CustomBusinessHour` frequency should pass successfully without exceeding the expected number of periods.
