### Analysis
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which inherits from `BusinessMixin`.
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is expecting a specific date range using `CustomBusinessHour` with holidays, but the current implementation is not handling holidays correctly, leading to incorrect results.
3. The error message indicates a failure in validating the frequency, which is caused by the incorrect calculation of dates in the presence of holidays.
4. The strategy to fix the bug involves updating the logic related to handling holidays in the function.

### Bug Cause
The bug causes incorrect date adjustment when there are holidays in the calculation, leading to an extra day added in the date range generation, as observed in the failing test.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic related to handling holidays in the `apply` function. We should properly handle holidays to ensure that the date adjustments are accurate.

### Corrected Function
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, dt):
        if isinstance(dt, datetime):
            curr_dt = datetime(
                dt.year, dt.month, dt.day, dt.hour, dt.minute, dt.second, dt.microsecond
            )
            original_dt = curr_dt
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                while n > 0:
                    curr_dt = self._next_opening_time(curr_dt)
                    if curr_dt.date() in self.holidays:
                        continue
                    n -= 1
            else:
                while n < 0:
                    curr_dt = curr_dt - timedelta(seconds=1)
                    if curr_dt.date() in self.holidays:
                        continue
                    n += 1
                curr_dt = self._next_opening_time(curr_dt)
                curr_dt = self._get_closing_time(curr_dt)

            business_hours_per_day = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(start, end) for start, end in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            business_days, remaining_seconds = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours_per_day // 60)
            if n < 0:
                business_days, remaining_seconds = -business_days, -remaining_seconds

            if business_days != 0:
                holiday_skip = CustomBusinessDay(n=business_days, holidays=self.holidays)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(original_dt):
                    prev_opening = self._prev_opening_time(original_dt)
                    rem_time = original_dt - prev_opening
                    curr_dt = prev_opening + holiday_skip + rem_time
                else:
                    curr_dt = original_dt + holiday_skip

            remaining_hours = timedelta(minutes=remaining_seconds)

            while remaining_hours != timedelta(0):
                next_closing = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(curr_dt))
                diff_hours = next_closing - curr_dt
                if remaining_hours < diff_hours:
                    curr_dt += remaining_hours
                    remaining_hours = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    remaining_hours -= diff_hours
                    curr_dt = self._next_opening_time(curr_dt + diff_hours) if n >= 0 else self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(curr_dt + diff_hours - timedelta(seconds=1))

            return curr_dt
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By updating the logic to properly handle holidays and adjust the date calculations accordingly, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and provide the expected output.
