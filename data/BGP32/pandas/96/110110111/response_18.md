### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is supposed to adjust a given timestamp based on business hours defined by the `CustomBusinessHour` offset. However, due to incorrect adjustment logic, the function fails to handle holidays and adjust the timestamp properly.
   
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` showcases the issue where the date_range generation with periods yields unexpected results due to incorrect business hour adjustments when holidays are involved.

3. The expected input parameters in the failing test are a mixture of timestamp objects and integer values representing the number of periods. The output is expected to be a DatetimeIndex object containing properly adjusted timestamps based on business hour rules.

4. The cause of the bug is in the incorrect adjustment of the given timestamp when a holiday is present. This leads to miscalculations and incorrect increments, resulting in unexpected behavior in the date_range generation when periods are involved.

5. To fix the bug, the adjustment logic inside the `apply` function needs to be adjusted to properly handle holidays and adjust timestamps based on business hours. Ensuring correct calculations and adjustments will resolve the issue.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function to handle holiday adjustment and business hour increments properly:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            # Adjusting for holidays
            while not self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            if n > 0:
                while n > 0:
                    other += timedelta(hours=1)
                    if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    n -= 1
            elif n < 0:
                while n < 0:
                    other -= timedelta(hours=1)
                    if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    n += 1

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With this corrected version of the `apply` function, the adjustments for holidays and business hours are properly handled, ensuring the correct adjustment of timestamps based on the `CustomBusinessHour` offset rules. This fix should address the issue mentioned in the GitHub report and pass the failing test case successfully.
