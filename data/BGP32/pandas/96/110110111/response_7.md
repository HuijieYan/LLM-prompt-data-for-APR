### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` inside the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `offsets.py` file of the pandas library.
2. The function is supposed to adjust a given datetime value based on business hours determined by start and end times. It handles positive and negative offsets, adjusts for business days and remaining hours.
3. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` creates a `CustomBusinessHour` frequency with specific holidays. The resulting `DateTimeIndex` does not match the expected values due to incorrect adjustments in the `apply` function.
4. The cause of the bug is likely related to how the function handles start times, holidays, and adjustments when calculating business hours.
5. To fix the bug, we need to carefully adjust the logic for handling holidays and business hour adjustments in different scenarios.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure correct handling of holidays and adjustment when calculating business hours.
2. Properly manage adjustments for positive and negative offsets.
3. Update logic for moving to next or previous business days when needed.

### Bug-Fixed Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            while n > 0:
                if other.time() in self.end:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
                    if businesshours == 0:
                        break
                    time_remaining = timedelta(seconds=self._seconds_to_next_opening(other))
                    if time_remaining >= abs(n) * businesshours:
                        n = 0
                        other += timedelta(seconds=n * businesshours)
                    else:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                        n -= 1
        else:
            while n < 0:
                if other.time() == self.start[0]: 
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if other.time() in self.start or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                else:
                    businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
                    if businesshours == 0:
                        break
                    time_remaining = timedelta(seconds=self._seconds_to_prev_opening(other))
                    if time_remaining >= abs(n) * businesshours:
                        n = 0
                        other -= timedelta(seconds=abs(n) * businesshours)
                    else:
                        other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                        n += 1

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the logic in the `apply` function to handle holidays, offsets, and adjustments properly, the fixed version should pass the failing test and correctly adjust datetime values based on the CustomBusinessHour offsets while accounting for holidays.
