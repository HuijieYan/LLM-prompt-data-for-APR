### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function Relationship:**
   - The buggy function `apply` is related to the `CustomBusinessHour` class which extends `BusinessHourMixin`.
   - The buggy function tries to adjust business hours based on the input `other` which should be a `datetime` object.
   
2. **Error Cause:**
   - The bug seems to stem from incorrect adjustment of dates when `other` crosses over holidays and non-business day periods.
   - The error occurs when using periods and adding holidays, causing the number of dates generated to exceed the expected count.

3. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**
   - Properly handle date adjustments when meeting holidays and non-business days. Ensure accurate calculations to stay within the expected date range.
   - Refactor the logic related to date adjustments and business hour calculations to address the issue.
   
4. **Suggested Fix:**
   - Update the adjustment algorithm to correctly handle the transition between business hours and holidays/non-business days.
   - Make sure the total count of generated dates matches the expected number of periods, considering adjustments for holidays and non-business days.

5. **Corrected Version:**
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Adjust for non-business hours
        if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        n = self.n

        while n != 0:
            # Update the date based on business hours and holidays
            if n > 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                if other in self.holidays:
                    other = self.next_bday.rollforward(other)
                n -= 1
            else:
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                if other in self.holidays:
                    other = self.next_bday.rollback(other)
                n += 1

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By incorporating the suggested corrections, the corrected function aims to accurately adjust the dates, considering holidays and non-business days, and ensure that the generated periods match the expected count.
