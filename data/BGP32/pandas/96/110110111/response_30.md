### Bug Analysis:

The bug occurs when using `pd.date_range` with the `freq` parameter as a custom business hour and specifying holidays. The `apply` function in the `CustomBusinessHour` class is not handling the holidays correctly, resulting in incorrect calculations and extra periods being generated.

The failing test case aims to create a date range with a custom business hour frequency while considering a holiday (`2020-11-26`). However, due to the bug in the `apply` function, the generated date range contains more periods than expected.

### Bug Explanation:

The bug is likely due to incorrect handling of holidays in the `apply` function. When adjusting the datetime to business hours, the function may not be correctly skipping the holiday or adjusting the date accordingly, leading to extra periods in the date range.

The error message indicates a discrepancy in the inferred frequency compared to the expected frequency, which aligns with the bug's behavior of generating more periods than intended.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix the bug:
1. Ensure that the `apply` function correctly skips holidays and adjusts dates accordingly.
2. Check the logic for adjusting the datetime to business hours, making sure it accounts for holidays between periods.
3. Verify that the increment in periods aligns with the expected behavior even when holidays are present.

Let's correct the `apply` function to handle holidays properly and generate the expected date range with the custom business hour frequency.

### Corrected Version:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if isinstance(other, pd.Timestamp):
            other = other.to_pydatetime()
            
        business_datetime = self._adjust_for_holiday(other)
            
        if self._is_on_offset(business_datetime):
            return business_datetime
        
        if self.n >= 0:
            business_datetime = self._next_opening_time(business_datetime)
        else:
            business_datetime = self._prev_opening_time(business_datetime)
        
        business_datetime = self._adjust_for_holiday(business_datetime)
        
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        timediff = timedelta(seconds=self.n * 60 * 60)
        adjusted_business_datetime = business_datetime + timediff
        
        return adjusted_business_datetime
    raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
    
def _adjust_for_holiday(self, other):
    if other.date() in self.holidays:
        if self.n >= 0:
            return self._adjust_for_holiday(other + timedelta(days=1))
        else:
            return self._adjust_for_holiday(other - timedelta(days=1))
    return other
```

This corrected version includes handling holidays properly by recursively adjusting the datetime if it falls on a holiday. Additionally, the logic for advancing or moving back to the next business day is checked after handling holidays to ensure correct adjustments. The function now accounts for holidays when calculating business hours.
