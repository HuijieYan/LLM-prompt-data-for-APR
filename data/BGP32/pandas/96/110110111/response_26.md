### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is meant to handle business hour offsets for datetime objects. The function contains logic to adjust the input datetime based on the provided business hour offset and handle the edge cases accordingly.
   
2. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` encounters an error related to compatibility issues with frequencies when using `date_range` with custom business hours and including holidays. The error message indicates a failure in validating the frequency.

3. The main cause of the bug seems to be the incorrect adjustment of business days and business hours within the `apply` function for certain cases, leading to inaccurate datetime calculations. This leads to unexpected datetime outputs and incompatibility issues when generating date ranges.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the adjustments for business days and business hours are correctly calculated to align with the specified business hour offset. Additionally, the adjustments for holidays need to be handled properly to ensure accurate datetime outputs without frequency validation issues.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the logic related to business day and business hour adjustments to correctly handle positive and negative offset cases.
2. Ensure that the operations related to skipping business days and adjusting business hours are accurate and properly account for holidays.
3. Fix any issues with adjusting the input datetime object to align with the business hour offset.
4. Validate the frequency and handle holidays appropriately to avoid compatibility issues when generating date ranges with custom business hours and holidays.

### Bug-fixed version of the `apply` function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n
        
        # Adjust other based on business hour offset and holidays
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        businesshours = sum(  # Get total business hours for one business day
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )
        
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r
        
        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd
        
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)  # Remaining business hours to adjust
        
        # Adjust remaining business hours
        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By updating the logic in the `apply` function as per the bug fix strategy, the function should now correctly handle business hour offsets, adjustments for holidays, and ensure compatibility when generating date ranges with custom business hours and holidays.
