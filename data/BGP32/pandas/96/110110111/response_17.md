### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the file `pandas/tseries/offsets.py`.
2. The failing test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is present in the file `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py`.
3. The primary issue appears to be related to incorrect adjustment of business hours while considering holidays, resulting in an incorrect number of periods generated when using the `date_range` function with custom business hours and holidays.
4. The error message indicates a `ValueError` that occurs during frequency validation, likely due to anomalies introduced by the buggy behavior.
5. The expected input/output values for relevant variables show discrepancies which lead to incorrect results during the function execution.
6. The GitHub issue highlights a specific scenario where adding holidays in a `CustomBusinessHour` frequency context causes unexpected behavior in generating date ranges.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the improper handling of holidays within the `BusinessHourMixin` class's `apply` function. Insufficient adjustments during holiday periods may lead to an incorrect count of business hours, causing the number of generated periods to be inaccurate in the `date_range` function.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure proper adjustments for holidays within the business hours mixin.
2. Correctly handle the cases where holidays affect the business hour counts and ensure accurate adjustments.
3. Update the function 'apply' to correctly handle holiday-related adjustments while calculating business periods.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            adjust_datetime = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
            
            if n >= 0:
                orig_dt = adjust_datetime
                while n > 0:
                    adjust_datetime = self._next_opening_time(adjust_datetime)
                    if self._is_on_offset(adjust_datetime) or adjust_datetime.time() in self.start:
                        n -= 1
                if orig_dt != adjust_datetime:
                    adjust_datetime = self._next_opening_time(adjust_datetime)
            else:
                orig_dt = adjust_datetime
                while n < 0:
                    if adjust_datetime.time() not in self.start:
                        adjust_datetime = adjust_datetime - timedelta(seconds=1)
                    adjust_datetime = self._next_opening_time(adjust_datetime)
                    adjust_datetime = self._get_closing_time(adjust_datetime)
                    n += 1
                if orig_dt != adjust_datetime:
                    adjust_datetime = self._get_closing_time(adjust_datetime)
    
            return adjust_datetime
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and pass the failing test by handling holidays properly within the business hour calculations.
