### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` inside the `BusinessHourMixin` class in `pandas/tseries/offsets.py`.
2. The failing test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` involves creating a date range with a custom business hour frequency including holidays.
3. The error message indicates a `ValueError` raised in the function `_validate_frequency` related to frequency validation.
4. The expected values in the failing test are not met due to incorrect calculations within the `apply` function.
5. The issue on GitHub highlights the problem where date_range with periods and holidays results in more periods than expected.

### Bug Location:
The bug likely arises from the calculations inside the `apply` function where adjustments for business hours and holidays are not handled correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug:
1. Ensure correct handling of edge cases where holidays may impact business hours.
2. Adjust the calculations for business days and remaining business hours based on the nature of the input.

### Corrected Function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
            
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                other = other + skip_bd if self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other) else self._prev_opening_time(other) + skip_bd + (other - self._prev_opening_time(other))
            
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other if n >= 0 else self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and getattr(other, 'nanosecond', 0) != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other += bhour

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the calculations and handling special cases related to holidays and business days, the fixed function should now provide the expected output for the failing test case.
