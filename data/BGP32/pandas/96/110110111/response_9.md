## Analysis
### Buggy Function
The buggy function is `apply` inside the `BusinessHourMixin` class. This function is used to adjust a given datetime object according to custom business hours logic. The function takes a parameter `other` which is expected to be a `datetime` object. The function contains various calculations related to adjusting the datetime object based on business hours, holidays, start and end times, etc.

### Test Code
The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is trying to create a date range using a custom business hour frequency that starts at 15:00 with holidays specified. The expected result is a date range with 4 periods spread over 2 business days with adjusted timings due to the holiday.

### Error Message
The error message indicates a ValueError occurring during the validation of the frequency. The test fails due to the mismatch between the expected and actual values in the resulting date range when holidays are introduced.

### Expected Input/Output Values
For the buggy function, the expected input/output values have been provided for different scenarios to help guide the correction process.

### GitHub Issue
The GitHub issue details a problem with using `date_range` with custom business hours and holidays causing unexpected behavior. The output has more periods than expected due to the introduction of holidays in the frequency definition.

## Bug Explanation
The buggy function's logic for adjusting the datetime object based on the custom business hours, holidays, and elapsed time is not handling the holiday scenario correctly. This results in incorrect adjustments to the date, leading to unexpected date ranges in certain cases.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the logic related to adjusting the datetime object based on holidays and business hours needs to be revised. When adjusting the timings due to holidays, the adjustment should ensure the correct positioning of the datetime object within the business hours.

## Corrected Function

```python
# Corrected version of the apply function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            # Adjust the start time to the next opening time
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            # Adjust the datetime to the previous business day if starting time is a business hour
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Calculate total business hours in a day
        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        # Adjust by number of business days
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            if n >= 0:
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0) != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

The corrected version of the function includes adjustments to handle holidays properly and maintain the expected behavior when calculating the adjusted datetime based on business hours logic.

By incorporating the suggested corrections, the function should now provide the correct adjustments to the datetime object based on the custom business hours and holidays.
