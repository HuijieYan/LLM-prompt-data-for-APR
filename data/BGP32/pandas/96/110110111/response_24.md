## Bug Analysis

1. The provided buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
   
2. Based on the failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py`, the error occurs when using `pd.date_range` with a custom business hour frequency and holidays.

3. The failing test produced an error message stating `ValueError: Inferred frequency None from passed values does not conform to passed frequency CBH`, indicating an issue with frequency validation within the `DatetimeIndex` generation process.

4. The expected input/output values for the failing test case ares provided for several scenarios, involving different dates, times, and CustomBusinessHour settings.

5. The GitHub issue titled "Pandas date_range does not work when using periods and adding holiday" describes a similar scenario to the failing test and requests assistance in understanding the unexpected behavior when using `pd.date_range` with holidays.

## Bug Fix Strategy

1. The bug likely stems from an issue with frequency validation when generating the DatetimeIndex with a custom business hour frequency and holidays.

2. To fix the bug, we should ensure that the frequency validation in the `_validate_frequency` method correctly handles the custom business hour frequency with holidays.

3. The bug fix should enable `pd.date_range` to work as expected when specifying both periods and holidays for a custom business hour frequency.

## Bug Fix

Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function within the `BusinessHourMixin` class:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other) or other in self.holidays:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other) or other in self.holidays:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version includes additional checks for holidays when adjusting the `other` datetime based on the custom business hour settings.

By integrating holiday checks during the adjustment process, the function should properly handle scenarios where holidays are involved in the business hour calculations, resolving the issue raised in the GitHub thread and passing the failing test case.
