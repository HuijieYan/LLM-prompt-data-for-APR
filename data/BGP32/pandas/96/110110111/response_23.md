### Analysis:
- The buggy function is the `apply` method in the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas` library.
- The buggy function is failing a test related to custom business hours and holidays, causing unexpected behavior in the returned datetime indices.
- The failing test case in `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is related to a test for custom business hours with holidays, which is causing the generated date range to have more periods than expected.
- The error message raised during the test execution (`ValueError: Inferred frequency None from passed values does not conform to passed frequency CBH`) indicates a frequency-related issue.
- The bug seems to be in the logic of adjusting business days and remaining business hours within the `apply` method.
- The current behavior suggests incorrectly handling holidays with custom business hours, leading to an incorrect number of periods in the resulting date range.
- The expected values of the function's parameters and intermediate variables are provided for multiple test cases to guide the correction process.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the custom business hour logic correctly handles holidays in the adjustment process.
2. Review the business day adjustment logic to correctly account for holidays and adjust business hours accordingly.
3. Check the code paths in the `apply` function related to negative and non-negative values of `n` to address potential issues when adjusting date ranges.
4. Validate the time intervals and offsets to ensure correct adjustments according to business hours and holidays.
5. Adjust the logic for handling remaining business hours to align with the expected behavior during date range generation.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        other_date = other.date()  # Extract the date part
        if other_date in self.holidays:
            raise ApplyTypeError("The given date is a holiday")
        
        reference_start = datetime.combine(other_date, self.start[0])  # Reference with start time
        if other.time() < self.start[0] or other.time() >= self.end[0]:
            other = self._next_opening_time(other, reference_start)
        
        interval_start = datetime.replace(other, hour=self.start[0].hour, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
        
        total_hours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        total_seconds = (other - interval_start).total_seconds()
        n, r = divmod(abs(total_seconds), total_hours)
        n = -n if self.start[0] > self.end[0] else n

        if n != 0:
            if n > 0:
                other += n * timedelta(days=1)
            else:
                other -= abs(n) * timedelta(days=1)

        if r != 0:
            boundary_delta = self._get_closing_time(interval_start) - other if n < 0 else other - interval_start
            boundary_delta_seconds = boundary_delta.total_seconds()
            if boundary_delta_seconds >= 0:  # Adjust within the boundary
                other += timedelta(seconds=min(r*60, boundary_delta_seconds))
            else:  # Move to the next interval
                other = self._next_opening_time(other, reference_start)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Changes Made:
- Improved logic for handling holidays and adjusting date/time intervals within the `apply` function to ensure correct behavior.
- Adjusted the boundary checks and adjustments based on the sign of `n` to reflect the correct direction of date adjustments.
- Enhanced the logic for determining intervals and adjusting remaining business hours to align with expected date range generation outcomes.
