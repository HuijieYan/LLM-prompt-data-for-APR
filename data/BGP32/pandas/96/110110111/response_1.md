## Analysis and Bug Identification
1. The buggy function `apply` is supposed to adjust the given datetime object based on business hours offset. However, the error arises when holidays are involved in the calculation.
2. The failing test scenario involves creating a date range with custom business hours and a holiday specified leading to unexpected behavior in the output.
3. The error message indicates a failure in frequency validation due to unmatched inferred frequency.
4. The bug stems from incorrect adjustment of the `other` datetime object when holidays fall within the business hour offset.
5. To fix the bug, the adjustment logic when encountering holidays needs to include proper handling to ensure the correct behavior during date range creation.
6. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the problem of unexpected behavior when using periods, holidays, and custom business hours in `pd.date_range`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Improve the adjustment logic inside the `apply` function to handle holidays correctly when calculating business hour offsets.
2. Ensure that the adjusted datetime reflects the holiday and business hours conditions properly to address the error.
3. Test the corrected function against all expected cases to validate the fix.

## Corrected Function
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # adjusted for holidays
            while self._is_on_offset(other):
                other += timedelta(hours=1)  # move to the next hour if holiday
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() not in self.start:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and other.nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

With the above correction in place, the function should now accurately adjust the given datetime object based on the defined business hour offset, including correct handling of holidays in the process.
