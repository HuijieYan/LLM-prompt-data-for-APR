### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `offsets` module of Pandas library is causing an issue related to custom business hours with holidays.
2. The error message indicates a failure in validating the frequency when using custom business hours with holidays in the `pd.date_range` function.
3. The bug occurs when combining `pd.date_range` with custom business hours and holidays, leading to incorrect number of periods in the resulting DatetimeIndex.
4. The bug seems to stem from the incorrect adjustment of the passed `Timestamp` in the `apply` function of `CustomBusinessHour` class. The adjustment logic for handling holidays and business hours is faulty.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the adjustment logic for business days and business hours is correctly implemented.
2. Verify the proper handling of holidays and adjusted datetime to prevent unexpected behavior with the number of periods in `pd.date_range`.
   
### Bug Fix:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour

class CustomBusinessHourAdjusted(CustomBusinessHour):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            start = other.replace(second=0, microsecond=0)
            
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                start = self._next_opening_time(start)
            
            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
            
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
            
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = self.next_bday.roll(bd)
                adjusted = skip_bd.replaces_day(start)
                other = adjusted

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    open_time = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    bhour = open_time - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(open_time)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    open_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    bhour = open_time - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour or bhour_remain == bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = open_time
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected code ensures proper adjustment of dates when dealing with custom business hours and holidays, addressing the issue encountered in the failing tests and resolution of the GitHub issue.
