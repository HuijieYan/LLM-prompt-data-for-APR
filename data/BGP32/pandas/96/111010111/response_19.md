### Analysis
The buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class from the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file is causing an issue when combined with the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency, especially when holidays are involved. The error message indicates a ValueError raised during frequency validation.

### Bug Identification
The buggy function `apply` seems to have issues in handling the holiday scenario when adjusting datetime values. The bug likely stems from the logic related to adjusting for the holidays and the duration of business hours.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the `apply` function fails to correctly adjust the datetime values for holidays, leading to inconsistencies in calculating business hours in some cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting the datetime values based on holidays and business hours needs to be refined. Specifically, attention should be given to how holidays are factored in and how adjustments are made for the duration of business hours.

### Corrected Function

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if isinstance(other, pd.Timestamp):
            other = other.to_pydatetime()
        else:
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
        
        n = self.n

        adjusted = False
        holidays = set(self.holidays)

        if other in holidays:
            while other in holidays:
                other += timedelta(days=1)
            adjusted = True

        start, end = self.start[0], self.end[0]
        business_duration = (end.hour - start.hour) * 60

        if n > 0:
            if not adjusted and (other.time() >= end or not self._is_on_offset(other)):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() < start or other.time() == end:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        working_days = business_duration // 60
        adjust_days, remaining_minutes = divmod(abs(n) * 60, working_days)

        if n < 0:
            adjust_days *= -1
            remaining_minutes *= -1

        skip_bd = pd.offsets.CustomBusinessDay(n=adjust_days)
        if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
            prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            remain = other - prev_open
            other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
        else:
            other += skip_bd

        remaining_timedelta = timedelta(minutes=remaining_minutes)

        while remaining_timedelta != timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            if remaining_timedelta < bhour:
                other += remaining_timedelta
                remaining_timedelta = timedelta(0)
            else:
                remaining_timedelta -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By refining the adjustment logic and handling holidays properly, the corrected function should now be able to handle the scenario described in the GitHub issue without encountering the previous ValueError.
