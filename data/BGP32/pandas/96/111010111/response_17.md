### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class.
2. The function `apply` is decorated with `@apply_wraps`, invoking the `apply_wraps` decorator.
3. The error message indicates a ValueError is raised during validation of the frequency in a `DatetimeIndex`.
4. The bug seems to cause unexpected frequency values that don't conform to the expected frequency of business hours.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `apply` function seems to be related to the incorrect calculation of business hours and adjustments when combining business hours with `datetime` objects. This results in misalignments with the expected frequency, triggering the ValueError during validation.

The incorrect calculation and adjustments in the function lead to the misalignment of business hours and thus incorrect frequencies in the resulting date_range.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, ensure that the calculations and adjustments in the `apply` function align properly with the expected business hours frequency. Correct the logic for adjusting timestamps to ensure they fall correctly within the defined business hours.

### Corrected Function:
```python
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            nativ_dt = other.replace(tzinfo=None)  # Remove timezone info
            day_dt = nativ_dt.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)

            if n >= 0:
                if nativ_dt.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(day_dt):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if nativ_dt.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(day_dt):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other.replace(minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correcting the logic for adjusting timestamps, the function should align the resulting timestamps correctly with the expected business hours frequency, resolving the ValueError issue during frequency validation.
