### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `apply` method defined in the `BusinessHourMixin` class.
2. The bug in the function seems to be related to the handling of business hours, adjustments for holidays, and adjustments for the number of business days.
3. The error message indicates a `ValueError` being raised during frequency validation.
4. The expected input/output values are provided for different scenarios, along with the related classes and their attributes.
5. The issue on GitHub highlights a problem where `date_range` behaves unexpectedly when using `periods` along with a custom business hour frequency that includes holidays.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. The bug is likely due to issues in adjusting timestamps when they fall on holidays, resulting in additional periods being added to the date range.
2. Incorrect handling of adjustments based on the number of business days and business hours can lead to unexpected behavior, as observed in the failing test case.
3. The error message is triggered by a mismatch between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency when holidays are involved.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure correct adjustments for holidays and business days within the function.
2. Check the logic related to adjusting timestamps based on business hours.
3. Verify the computation of business days and business hours to prevent the unexpected addition of periods to the date range.
4. Address the frequency validation to account for holidays and constancy in frequency across the date range.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            # adjust other to eliminate timezone and nanosecond
            other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0)

            # adjust other based on business hours and holidays
            while n != 0:
                if n > 0:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other) if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other) else other
                else:
                    if other.time() in self.start:
                        other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)

                    # check for holidays
                    if other in self.holidays:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)

                n = n - 1 if n > 0 else n + 1

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the logic of the function to correctly handle holidays and business days, the corrected version aims to resolve the bug and pass the failing test case mentioned in the GitHub issue.
