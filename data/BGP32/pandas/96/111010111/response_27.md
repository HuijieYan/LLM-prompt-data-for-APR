### Analysis
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class and is supposed to apply business hour offsets to datetime objects.
2. The function contains multiple conditional branches that adjust the input datetime based on the offset value and other conditions.
3. The bug seems to be related to the adjustment and handling of business days, business hours, and timedelta calculations. The error message suggests that the calculated frequency is not conforming to the passed frequency.
4. The provided input values and expected output values reflect the adjustment logic within the function.
5. The issue on GitHub indicates that `pd.date_range` behaves oddly when combining periods with holidays.

### Bug Explanation
The bug might stem from incorrect logic within the `apply` function that is misinterpreting the frequency of business hours in relation to given holidays. This misinterpretation leads to unexpected additional periods being generated, causing the mismatch in the frequency of `DatetimeIndex`.

### Proposed Fix
1. An adjustment in the logic of how holidays are handled within the `apply` function may resolve the bug.
2. Ensuring that the adjustment for holidays is correctly applied when determining the next business time for a given datetime.
3. It is important to validate the logic behind the adjustment for business days and business hours to avoid inconsistencies in the frequency of periods.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(
                year=other.year,
                month=other.month,
                day=other.day,
                hour=other.hour,
                minute=other.minute,
                second=other.second,
                microsecond=other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            # adjust other datetime based on the offset direction
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # calculate total business hours in a day
            business_hours_sum = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            # calculate business days offset and remaining business hours
            business_days_offset, remaining = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours_sum // 60)
            if n < 0:
                business_days_offset, remaining = -business_days_offset, -remaining

            # adjust by business days first
            if business_days_offset != 0:
                business_days_shift = BusinessDay(n=business_days_offset)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + business_days_shift + remain
                else:
                    other += business_days_shift

            # adjust remaining business hours
            remaining_hours = timedelta(minutes=remaining)
    
            while remaining_hours != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour > remaining_hours or (bhour == remaining_hours and other.tzinfo is not None):
                    other += remaining_hours
                    remaining_hours = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    remaining_hours -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By modifying the adjustment logic for holidays, business days, and business hours, the corrected code should properly handle the frequency adjustments and address the issue observed in the failing test case.
