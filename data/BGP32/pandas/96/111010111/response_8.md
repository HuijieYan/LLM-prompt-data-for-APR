### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas.tseries.offsets` file. It is responsible for adjusting a datetime object based on business hours.
2. The error message indicates a `ValueError` being raised during frequency validation related to CustomBusinessHour.
3. The bug seems to be related to the mismatch between the inferred frequency and the provided frequency.
4. The bug can be fixed by updating the approach to frequency validation and ensuring that the inferred frequency aligns with the passed frequency.

### Strategy:
1. Update the frequency validation logic to better handle CustomBusinessHour offsets.
2. Make sure that the inferred frequency matches the frequency being used to avoid the ValueError.
3. Adjust the logic in the function to correctly calculate the adjusted datetime based on business hours.

### Bug-fix:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)

                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

            return other

        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and align with the expected input/output values across different scenarios.
