## Analysis
1. The buggy function `apply` is a method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. It takes in a `Timestamp` object as the `other` parameter and performs a series of calculations based on the class attributes. The method is using various class methods and properties within its execution.
   
2. The error message indicates a `ValueError` being raised during the validation of frequency in the `_validate_frequency` method which in turn is called during the test case execution.

3. The bug seems to be related to an issue with the validation of frequency possibly due to holidays being erroneously added in the calculation. The expected input/output values and types provided for the failing test cases further clarify the expected behavior and values at different stages of the function's execution.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `apply` method handles holidays correctly and updates the timestamp calculation logic accordingly.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the logic related to handling holidays in the `apply` method to ensure correct calculation based on holidays.
2. Update the logic in the `apply` method considering different scenarios related to holidays while adjusting the timestamp.
3. Ensure that the time intervals are calculated correctly when holidays are involved to avoid exceeding the expected number of periods.

## Bug-fixed Function
```python
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # reset timezone and nanosecond
            other = datetime(

                    if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and other.nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:

                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(
                                other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                            )
                        )
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By updating the holiday handling logic and adjusting the timestamp calculation process, the above bug-fixed version of the `apply` method should now handle the case involving holidays correctly.
