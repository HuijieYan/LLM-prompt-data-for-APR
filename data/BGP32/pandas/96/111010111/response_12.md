### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class which has several related functions for business hour calculations.
2. The error message indicates a `ValueError` being raised during the test.
3. The buggy function manipulates datetime values based on business hours, adjusting dates and times accordingly.
4. The bug likely resides in the code segment handling adjustments based on `bd` and `bhour_remain`.
5. The GitHub issue indicates a problem with `date_range` producing more periods than expected when holidays are included.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to incorrect adjustments performed in the function when handling negative numbers of business days (`bd`). When calculating the remaining business hours to adjust (`bhour_remain`), the code does not properly handle the scenarios where the adjustment is not synchronized with the business time intervals. This results in deviations from the expected output, leading to the raised `ValueError`.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Improve adjustments for negative business days to ensure correct behavior.
2. Check and update how the remaining business hours are calculated and adjusted to align with business hours accurately.

### Correction:
```python
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self.next_bday.rollforward(other)
                    if r < 0:
                        r += businesshours
                other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_business_hours_by_sec(self.start[0], self.end[0])
                next_opening = self._next_opening_time(other)
                closing = self._get_closing_time(next_opening)
                if r > 0:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    if bhour_remain >= timedelta(0):
                        other = closing
                        r -= 1
                    else:
                        other = next_opening + bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain += bhour
                    if bhour_remain <= timedelta(0):
                        other = closing + bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        other = next_opening
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

By updating the adjustment logic and ensuring proper handling of negative business days and remaining business hours, the corrected function should align with the expected behavior and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
