### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is supposed to apply custom business hours to a given datetime. It aims to adjust the datetime according to the business hour rules specified.
2. The error message indicates a `ValueError` being raised, specifically due to a discrepancy between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency.
3. The bug likely stems from incorrect adjustments of the datetime based on business hours, potentially causing the timedelta calculations to proceed incorrectly.
4. To fix the bug, the adjustment logic within the function needs a detailed review.
5. The corrected version of the function will involve careful handling of datetime adjustments to ensure the correct application of custom business hours.

### Bug Fix:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, datetime):
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
    
    n = self.n
    
    if n >= 0:
        if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
    else:
        if other.time() in self.start:
            other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
        if not self.is_on_offset(other):
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            other = self._get_closing_time(other)

    businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

    bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
    if n < 0:
        bd, r = -bd, -r
    
    while bd != 0:
        other = self.next_bday.apply(other)
        bd -= 1
    
    bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

    while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
        bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other if n >= 0 else self._next_opening_time(other) - other
        if bhour_remain < bhour:
            other += bhour_remain
            break
        other += bhour
        bhour_remain -= bhour

    return other
```

By correcting the adjustment logic and ensuring precise timedelta calculations, the function should now correctly apply the custom business hours to the given datetime.
