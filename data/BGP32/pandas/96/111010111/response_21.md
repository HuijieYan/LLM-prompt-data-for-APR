### Analysis
1. The buggy function `apply` belongs to the class `BusinessHourMixin` in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The function calls several internal methods to perform business hour calculations.
3. The error message indicates a ValueError is raised during frequency validation, specifically because the inferred frequency does not match the passed frequency.
4. The function is used in a pandas test related to custom business hours and holidays, and the failing test is due to an invalid frequency generation.

### Bug in the Buggy Function
The bug seems to be related to how the function handles business days and adjusting business hours with holidays. The function logic for calculating business hours within a day and spanning days might not be considering the impact of holidays correctly.

### Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that holiday dates are properly handled when calculating the business days.
2. Adjust the business hour calculations to account for holidays and correctly apply adjustments based on the specified frequency.

### Corrected Function
```python
from datetime import time, timedelta
import numpy as np

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    def apply_wraps(func):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def next_bday(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def _next_opening_time(self, other, sign=1):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def _prev_opening_time(self, other):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def _get_business_hours_by_sec(self, start, end):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def _get_closing_time(self, dt):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def is_on_offset(self, dt):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def _is_on_offset(self, dt):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            holidays = set(self.holidays)
            while True:
                if other in holidays:
                    other += timedelta(days=1)
                else:
                    break

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                for _ in range(abs(bd)):
                    other += timedelta(days=1 if n > 0 else -1)
                    while other in holidays:
                        other += timedelta(days=1 if n > 0 else -1)

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    if n >= 0:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                    else:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                else:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the function takes into account the handling of holidays and appropriately adjusts the business days and hours calculation based on specified frequencies.
