### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is supposed to adjust a Timestamp object based on business hours, but it is failing when holidays are included in the CustomBusinessHour frequency. This leads to an error during the validation of the frequency in the `pd.date_range` function.
2. The issue is caused by the incorrect adjustment of the timestamp when holidays are involved, leading to an incorrect number of periods being computed.
3. The error message indicates a `ValueError` related to incorrect frequency validation when holidays are included.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `apply` function to correctly handle holidays when adjusting the timestamp based on business hours.
   
### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            
            # Create a copy of the datetime without timezone or nanosecond
            other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, nanosecond=0)
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.hour >= self.end[0].hour or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.hour < self.start[0].hour:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(days=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            # get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd, holidays=self.holidays)
                
                if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            # remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other) + bhour
            else:
                while bhour_remain.total_seconds() != 0:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version addresses the issue related to incorrect validation when holidays are included, ensuring the dates are adjusted correctly based on the CustomBusinessHour frequency.
