### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is missing the implementation details that are necessary for correcting the issue described in the GitHub problem.
2. The error arises from `ValueError` being raised when validating the frequency of the date range due to mismatching inferred and specified frequencies.
3. The issue in the GitHub problem is caused by the incorrect handling of holidays in the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency, resulting in unexpected behavior in generating the date range.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the `apply` function to properly consider holidays when adjusting the date range.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the `apply` function to correctly adjust the date range when holidays are provided in the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency.
2. Ensure that the implementation aligns with the expected input/output values provided for the failing test cases and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        original_day = other.date()
        while len(pd.date_range(start=original_day, end=original_day, freq=self)) == 0:
            original_day -= timedelta(days=1)

        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
        other = other + skip_bd

        if self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
            original_time = other.time()
            other = original_day + original_time

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(other) - other if n >= 0 else self._next_opening_time(other) - other
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                other += bhour
                bhour_remain -= bhour

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function includes adjustments to properly handle holidays within the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency, ensuring that the generated date range aligns with the expected behavior and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
