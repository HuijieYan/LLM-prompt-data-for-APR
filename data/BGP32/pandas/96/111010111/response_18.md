### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `apply` method within the `BusinessHourMixin` class.
2. The function is designed to adjust a given datetime by a custom business hour offset.
3. The error message indicates a ValueError is raised when trying to validate the frequency with the DatetimeIndex when applying a CustomBusinessHour frequency with holidays.
4. The bug seems to be related to how holidays are handled in conjunction with the CustomBusinessHour frequency, leading to an incorrect number of periods in certain cases.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the logic for handling holidays within the `apply` function is causing the function to incorrectly adjust the datetime, resulting in extra periods being added to the output. This leads to a mismatch with the expected values, triggering the ValueError during frequency validation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the implementation of adjusting for holidays within the `apply` function needs to be updated. The adjustment logic should be revised to correctly handle holidays while adjusting the datetime with the custom business hour offset.

### Code Fix:
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour, CustomBusinessDay, apply_wraps

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = CustomBusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    other = other + skip_bd
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the holiday handling logic within the `apply` function, the corrected code should now correctly adjust the datetime when applying a custom business hour frequency with holidays, resolving the issue of extra periods being added and causing a ValueError during frequency validation.
