### Analysis
- The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class.
- The function tries to adjust the input `other` based on business hours and days, handling various cases depending on the sign of `n`.
- The function makes use of various helper functions like `_next_opening_time`, `_prev_opening_time`, `_get_business_hours_by_sec`, `_get_closing_time`, `is_on_offset`, and `_is_on_offset`.
- The error message indicates a `ValueError` being raised during validation of the frequency when working with custom business hours.
- The expected input/output values and types for different cases are provided, indicating the expected behavior of the function.
- The GitHub issue describes a specific scenario where using `periods` and adding holidays leads to unexpected behavior in `date_range`.

### Bug Explanation
- The buggy function `apply` encounters issues when adjusting `other` based on business hours/days and holidays.
- The code incorrectly adjusts the input datetime, leading to unexpected changes beyond the expected business hours/days.
- Due to incorrect adjustments, the function ends up producing results with more than the expected number of periods, causing a `ValueError` during frequency validation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Review the logic related to adjusting `other` based on business hours and days to ensure it correctly handles various scenarios.
2. Verify the adjustments made to `other` when determining the final datetime value.
3. Address handling of holidays and any impact on the adjustment logic.
4. Ensure the output conforms to the expected business hours/days without exceeding the specified periods.
5. Modify the adjustment process to align with the intended behavior.

### Corrected Version
```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin:
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            
            # Adjust other for business hours
            if n >= 0:
                if other.hour > self.end[0].hour or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.hour == self.start[0].hour:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
            
            # Get total business hours in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
            
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
            
            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd
                
            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
            
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        break
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + timedelta(seconds=1)))
                
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the logic in the `apply` function to correctly handle the adjustments while considering business hours, days, and holidays, the corrected version should pass the failing test cases and achieve the expected behavior.
