### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The function is designed to apply business hour offsets to a given datetime input.
2. The error arises when using `pd.date_range` with the custom business hour frequency and holidays. The test case provided in the GitHub issue demonstrates the unexpected behavior where the number of periods is not correctly calculated when holidays are involved.
3. The bug likely originates from how holidays are not properly considered in the `apply` function when adjusting the datetime according to business hours.
4. To fix the bug, we should enhance the holiday handling within the `apply` function to ensure that the correct number of periods is calculated even when holidays are involved.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the `apply` function to account for holidays when calculating periods based on business hours.
2. Ensure that the datetime adjustments made in the function correctly handle the presence of holidays by considering them in the calculation of periods.
3. Update the logic related to adjusting the input datetime based on business hours to align accurately with the presence of holidays.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )

            # Adjust input datetime according to business hours and holidays
            while n != 0:
                if n > 0:
                    # Move to next opening time
                    if other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other):
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                        if other in self.holidays:
                            continue
                        n -= 1
                else:
                    # Move to previous opening time
                    if other.time() in self.start:
                        other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                    if not self.is_on_offset(other):
                        if other in self.holidays:
                            continue
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                        other = self._get_closing_time(other)
                        n += 1

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

This corrected version of the `apply` function should address the issue where the number of periods was not calculated correctly when holidays were involved in the business hour offset adjustment.
