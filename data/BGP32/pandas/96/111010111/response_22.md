### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class. It receives a timestamp `other` and performs various adjustments based on the value of `self.n` (number of business hours).
2. The error occurs when the function is called by `pd.date_range` with a frequency that includes a holiday, causing an issue with the number of periods generated.
3. The bug is likely related to the adjustment logic within the function, causing incorrect calculations and output. The error message indicates a `ValueError` raised during the frequency validation process.
4. To fix the bug, it's important to review the adjustment logic, ensure proper handling of holidays, and validate the frequency correctly.

### Proposed Fix:
Here's an updated version of the function that addresses the bug:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
    
        if n == 0:
            return other
    
        adjusted_dt = other.replace(tzinfo=None)  # Remove timezone information
        
        if n > 0:
            while n > 0:
                adjusted_dt = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_dt)
                n -= 1
        else:
            while n < 0:
                adjusted_dt = self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_dt)
                n += 1
        
        return adjusted_dt
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Note:
This fix simplifies the adjustment logic by iterating directly based on the value of `self.n` to find the correct business hours. Ensure to test this corrected version against the failing test cases to verify its correctness.
