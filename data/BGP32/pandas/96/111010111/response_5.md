### Analysis:
- The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class and is intended to adjust a given timestamp based on certain business hour rules.
- The error message suggests a problem with the frequency validation when applying custom business hour logic, leading to a `ValueError`. This is causing the failing test related to the `date_range` function.
- The `date_range` function is affected when using periods with the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency and adding holidays, leading to unexpected results.
- The bug could be traced back to how the `apply` function handles adjustments to timestamps based on business hours, potentially leading to incorrect results due to incorrect handling of opening and closing times for adjusted timestamps.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Verify and adjust the logic related to adjusting timestamps within business hours to ensure the correct flow of handling positive and negative `n` values.
2. Validate the adjustments applied based on the start and end times for business hours in a given day.
3. Ensure proper handling of holidays within the business logic to adjust the timestamps accordingly.
4. Adjust the logic for adding/subtracting business days and remaining business hours to align with the expected behavior.
5. Make necessary changes to ensure the corrected function aligns with the expected input/output values and satisfies the failing test scenario.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` function:
```python
# Import required libraries as needed

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    
    # Existing functions within the class
    
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not skip_bd.is_on_offset(other):
                    other = skip_bd.rollforward(other)
                else:
                    other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain:
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By implementing the corrected version of the `apply` function, it should address the frequency validation issue and align with the expected input/output values specified in the failing test cases related to custom business hours in `date_range`.
