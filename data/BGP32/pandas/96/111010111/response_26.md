### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is trying to adjust the given `datetime` object based on business hours specified in the CustomBusinessHour class instance.
2. The bug seems to be causing unexpected behavior when working with custom business hours and holidays, leading to an error in the `date_range` function.
3. The error message indicates a `ValueError` related to the frequency validation when using the CustomBusinessHour frequency with holidays.
4. The function is attempting to adjust the given `datetime` object to the next opening time, but it might be incorrectly handling certain scenarios related to holidays.
5. Potential strategy for fixing the bug:
   - Make adjustments to correctly handle holiday cases within the business hours adjustment logic.
### Bug Fix Approach:
1. Ensure that when adjusting the time taking into account business hours and holidays, the function handles holiday dates correctly to avoid unexpected behavior.
2. Check if the adjusted `datetime` object falls on a holiday and adjust accordingly.
3. Update the logic for adjusting business hours to consider holidays appropriately to align with the expected behavior.
4. Make sure to validate the adjusted frequency to avoid causing errors in functions like `date_range`.
### Bug-fixed version of the function:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if not isinstance(other, Timestamp):
            other = Timestamp(other)
            
        business_day_only = BusinessDay(n=0, holidays=self.holidays, weekmask=self.weekmask)
        
        if business_day_only.is_on_offset(other):
            next_valid_day = business_day_only.rollforward(other)
        else:
            next_valid_day = business_day_only.rollforward(other + timedelta(days=1))

        base_dt = other.replace(hour=self.start[0].hour, minute=self.start[0].minute, second=0, microsecond=0)
        if other < base_dt:
            other = base_dt

        n = self.n
        if n >= 0:
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if self.is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            if not self._is_on_offset(prev_open):
                other = prev_open

        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)

        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        valid_day = business_day_only.rollforward(other)
        final_dt = valid_day + timedelta(hours=bd * 24)
        remaining_minutes = r

        while remaining_minutes > 0:
            end_of_hours = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(final_dt))
            next_open_time = self._next_opening_time(final_dt)
            time_until_next_open = next_open_time - final_dt
            if remaining_minutes >= time_until_next_open.seconds // 60:
                remaining_minutes -= time_until_next_open.seconds // 60
                final_dt = next_open_time
            else:
                final_dt += timedelta(minutes=remaining_minutes)
                remaining_minutes = 0
                
        return Timestamp(final_dt)
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By updating the adjustment logic within the apply function, handling holidays properly, and adjusting the time according to business hours, the corrected version should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
