## Bug Analysis
1. The buggy function is `apply` within the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The error message indicates a `ValueError` is raised during the frequency validation process.
3. The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of holidays inside the `apply` function, leading to unexpected behavior in frequency generation.
4. To fix the bug, the `apply` function should be modified to correctly incorporate the handling of holidays in the frequency validation process.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the `apply` function to properly adjust for holidays when calculating the frequency based on business hours.
2. Specifically, ensure that the presence of holidays affects the generation of the frequency when calling `cls._generate_range`.
3. Adjust the validation logic to account for holidays and ensure that the frequencies conform appropriately.

## Bug Fix - Corrected Version
```python
    # this is the corrected function
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            orig_other = other
    
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd, holidays=self.holidays)
                other = other + skip_bd
    
            remaining_bhours = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while remaining_bhours != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    # business hour left in the current interval
                    bhours_till_close = self._get_closing_time(other) - other
                    if remaining_bhours < bhours_till_close:
                        other += remaining_bhours
                        remaining_bhours = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        # move to the next business time interval
                        remaining_bhours -= bhours_till_close
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhours_till_close)
                else:
                    bhours_till_open = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if (
                        remaining_bhours >= bhours_till_open
                        or (remaining_bhours == bhours_till_open and nanosecond != 0)
                    ):
                        other += remaining_bhours
                        remaining_bhours = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        remaining_bhours -= bhours_till_open
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(other + bhours_till_open - timedelta(seconds=1))
                        )
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

After applying this corrected version of the `apply` function, the failing test scenario should successfully pass, and the `ValueError` during frequency validation should be resolved.
