### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is supposed to adjust a given datetime based on the offset specified by the `CustomBusinessHour` instance it belongs to.
2. The bug seems to be related to the adjustment logic within the `apply` function, particularly when handling negative business hours (`n < 0`).
3. The error message indicates that the frequency inferred from the passed values does not conform to the expected frequency.
4. The bug may be caused by improper adjustments in the while loops for negative business hours.

### Bug cause:
In the `apply` function, the bug is triggered when adjusting for negative business hours. The logic within the while loops does not handle the case where `bhour_remain == bhour` properly, leading to incorrect adjustments.

### Fix strategy:
1. Improve the adjustment logic within the while loops when `n < 0`.
2. Ensure accurate adjustments for negative business hours based on the offset provided.
3. Check the conditions for finishing adjustments properly to align with the expected behavior.

### Corrected code:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )

                else:
                    other += skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        break
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                        other += bhour_remain
                        break
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version of the `apply` function should address the bug and align with the expected input/output values, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
