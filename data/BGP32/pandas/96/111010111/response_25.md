### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class within the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The buggy function `apply` is a method that adjusts a datetime according to business hours.
3. The error message indicates a failure when validating the frequency during a test related to custom business hours with holidays.
4. The bug causes the custom business hours with holidays to produce unexpected periods in the output, leading to a validation error.
5. The bug needs to be fixed to correctly handle custom business hours with holidays in `date_range`.

### Bug Issue:
The bug arises due to incorrect adjustments in the `apply` function when handling custom business hours with holidays, leading to incorrect period counts in the output.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the adjustments in the `apply` function need to be carefully reviewed and modified to account for holidays correctly and ensure the expected business hour schedule is adhered to.

### Corrected Function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n
            original_time = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
    
            # Adjust for holidays
            if other in self.holidays:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
    
            # Get the total business hours in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            # Calculate business day adjustments
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            # Adjust by the business days first
            if bd != 0:
                other += bd * self.next_bday
    
            # Adjust remaining business hours
            if r != 0:
                while r != 0:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if r >= bhour.total_seconds() // 60:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
                        r -= bhour.total_seconds() // 60
                    else:
                        other += timedelta(minutes=r)
                        r = 0
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By correctly adjusting for holidays and ensuring that the business day and hour calculations are accurate, the corrected function should handle custom business hours with holidays correctly within `date_range` and pass the failing test.
