### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is located in the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The error message `ValueError: Inferred frequency None from passed values does not conform to passed frequency CBH` indicates that there is an issue with the validation of frequency when using `pd.date_range` with `CustomBusinessHour` that includes holidays.
3. The GitHub issue reports a similar problem where adding holidays causes `date_range` to produce more periods than expected.
4. The bug is likely due to incorrect handling of holidays within the frequency validation process.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the frequency validation considers holidays properly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `apply` function to handle the case where holidays are included properly in the frequency adjustments.
2. Ensure that the frequency generated by the `CustomBusinessHour` correctly accounts for holidays.
3. Update the validation logic in the `_validate_frequency` method to consider holidays in the frequency calculation.
4. Test the corrected function with the failing test case to confirm the bug fix.

### Corrected Code:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            freq = self
            if isinstance(self.freq, CustomBusinessHour) and self.freq.holidays:
                freq = CustomBusinessHour(start=self.freq.start, holidays=self.freq.holidays)

            other = as_datetime(other)
            n = self.n

            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
``` 

By correcting the handling of holidays and adjustments within the `apply` function, the `ValueError` related to frequency validation when using `pd.date_range` with holidays and `CustomBusinessHour` should be resolved.
