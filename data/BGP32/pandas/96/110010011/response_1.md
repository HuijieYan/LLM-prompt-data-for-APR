### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class within the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The bug occurs when using `pd.date_range` with custom business hours and holidays, resulting in more periods generated than expected due to incorrect frequency handling.
3. The specific error message indicates that the inferred frequency does not conform to the passed frequency due to the inclusion of holidays.
4. The bug causes incorrect period calculation when holidays are involved in custom business hours.
5. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `apply` function to correctly handle holidays and maintain the desired number of periods.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
The bug is related to how custom business hours interact with holidays in the `apply` function. We need to modify the logic to account for holidays properly and ensure that the number of periods generated is accurate, maintaining the expected behavior without extra periods. 

### Corrected Version:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            n = self.n
            holiday_adjustment = timedelta(seconds=0)
            if isinstance(self, CustomBusinessHour) and isinstance(self.holidays, list):
                for holiday in self.holidays:
                    if other.date() == holiday:
                        holiday_adjustment = timedelta(hours=24)
                        break
            other += holiday_adjustment
            business_hour_duration = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
            num_hours = abs(n) * 60
            business_days, remaining_hours = divmod(num_hours, business_hour_duration // 60)
            if n < 0:
                business_days, remaining_hours = -business_days, -remaining_hours
            
            if business_days != 0:
                other = self.offset_period(other, BusinessDay(n=business_days), add_to_hour=False)
                
            remaining_timedelta = timedelta(minutes=remaining_hours)
            while remaining_timedelta != timedelta(0):
                opening_time = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                closing_time = self._get_closing_time(opening_time)
                hours_in_interval = closing_time - other if n >= 0 else other - opening_time
                if remaining_timedelta <= hours_in_interval:
                    other += remaining_timedelta
                    break
                remaining_timedelta -= hours_in_interval
                other = self._next_opening_time(closing_time)
            
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By adjusting the logic in the `apply` function to correctly handle holidays and maintain the number of periods expected, the bug should be resolved. The corrected version ensures that the custom business hours work as intended even in the presence of holidays.
