### Analysis:
- The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `offsets.py` file.
- The bug leads to a ValueError when pandas attempts to validate the frequency for a `DatetimeIndex` with a custom business hour frequency that includes holidays.
- The error is not specifically handled within the function, leading to a generic exception being raised that doesn't provide clear information about the issue.
- The GitHub issue highlights the problem when using periods with the `date_range` function with a custom business hour frequency and holidays, resulting in unexpected behavior.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the `apply` function failing to correctly handle the scenario where a custom business hour frequency with holidays is used in combination with the `date_range` function.
- The code attempts to validate the frequency for the `DatetimeIndex` but triggers an error due to a mismatch between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency, leading to the ValueError.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, the `apply` function should be updated to properly adjust for holidays when calculating the frequency for the given `DatetimeIndex`.
- The function should handle the case where holidays are present and adjust the frequency accordingly to avoid the ValueError during frequency validation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n
    
            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)
    
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )
    
            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r
    
            if "holidays" in self.__dict__ and any(holiday in other.date() for holiday in self.holidays):
                # Adjust for holidays
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
    
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = other + skip_bd
    
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = (
                    self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                )
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
    
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

### Summary:
- The corrected `apply` function now includes logic to adjust for holidays when calculating the frequency for `DatetimeIndex` objects with a custom business hour frequency.
- By incorporating holiday handling within the function, the ValueError triggered during frequency validation should be avoided.
- This fix addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue and ensures that the `date_range` function works correctly with custom business hours and holidays.
