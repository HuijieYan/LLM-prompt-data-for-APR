### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the `BusinessHourMixin` class in the `pandas/tseries/offsets.py` file.
2. The error message is related to the validation of a frequency when using `pd.date_range` with a custom business hour frequency and holidays.
3. The bug causes the `date_range` function to generate more periods than expected when holidays are included, leading to an error in frequency validation.
4. The bug is due to incorrect adjustments and calculations in the `apply` function that result in an incorrect number of periods when holidays are taken into account.
5. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling holidays and business hours calculation within the `apply` function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the logic to correctly adjust the business hours when holidays are encountered.
2. Ensure that the adjustment for holidays does not affect the total number of periods in the date range.
3. Validate the frequency correctly to avoid raising errors related to frequency mismatch.

### Corrected Version of the `apply` Function:
```python
    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            other = as_datetime(other)

            n = self.n

            if self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)

            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other += skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                if n >= 0:
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                else:
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other

                if bhour_remain < bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    if n >= 0:
                        other = self._next_opening_time(self._get_closing_time(other))
                    else:
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))
            
            return as_datetime(other)
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected version should resolve the issue with generating incorrect periods in `pd.date_range` when using a custom business hour frequency and holidays.
