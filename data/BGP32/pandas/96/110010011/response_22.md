### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `apply` is part of the class `BusinessHourMixin` in the file `pandas/tseries/offsets.py`.
2. The error occurs when using the `pd.date_range` function with custom business hours and holidays, leading to more periods being generated than expected.
3. The error message indicates a failed assertion check related to frequency validation, indicating an issue with frequency calculation.
4. The bug is caused by incorrect frequency handling within the `apply` function, leading to an incorrect number of periods being generated when holidays are present.
5. To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic in the `apply` function that deals with adjusting business days and hours.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Debug the frequency validation logic and ensure that it correctly handles holidays and adjusts periods accordingly.
2. Verify that the adjustment of business days and hours calculates the correct number of periods in the presence of holidays.
3. Make necessary changes to the function to ensure that the `apply` function behaves correctly when generating periods with custom business hours and holidays.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)

            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            other = other + skip_bd

            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = (
                    self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                )
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

            if n < 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if bhour_remain >= bhour or bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0:
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other))

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By making the adjustments in the while loops and the handling of business days, the corrected version of the `apply` function should be able to generate the correct number of periods without issues related to holidays.
